<HEADLINE> German, Swedish FMs Disappointed at U.S. Senate's Rejection of CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from
Germany and Sweden, Joschka Fischer and Anna Lindh, said here
today that they were deeply disappointed at a U.S. Senate decision
to reject the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (
CTBT), a global pact targeted at ending nuclear tests worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate decision represents a serious setback for
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and is therefore a wrong
signal, said the foreign ministers in a joint statement, adding
that they "deeply regret" the rejection.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers expressed the hope that President Clinton and
his administration would find a way to make the United States a
full supporter of the CTBT, and called on other nations across the
world to continue with their efforts of disarmament and nuclear
non-proliferation, which include the signing and ratification of
the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived in Stockholm on Wednesday for a two-day visit
at the invitation of the Swedish government. He is to hold talks
with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov later on Thursday. The
two will reportedly focus on the situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said at a press conference here that Germany believes
the conflict in Chechnya can be settled only through dialogue, and
the European Union and the United States is concerned about the
current fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, sources within the German Foreign Ministry earlier
ruled out any possibility that Fischer would, on behalf of the
western nations, present a special proposal on the resolution of
the Chechnya issue to the Russian side.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Israeli Agricultural Cooperation Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China could introduce overseas
advanced agricultural technology in an all-round way in some of
its provinces and regions, as a good way to accelerate the country
's agricultural upgrading.
</P>
<P>
This is a view shared by Chinese and overseas experts attending
the ongoing International Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and
Vegetable Processing Technology and Industrialization, which
opened on October 12 in the coastal city of Yantai in eastern
Shandong Province and will run through October 16.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is cited as an ideal choice for agricultural
cooperation with Israel, thanks to their similar climates.
</P>
<P>
Xuan Zengpei, an official of Chinese Academy of Engineering,
said that the popularization of greenhouses used for growing
vegetables in Shandong has set a good foundation for the province
to widely introduce irrigation technology and fine seeds from
Israel to further develop local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Located in an arid area, Israel is renowned for advanced
irrigation technologies, which carry weight in agricultural
development in the country and have helped quadruple its
agricultural output on the whole, said Nathan Shunari,
agricultural attache of the Israeli Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed Israel's efficient agriculture to high-level
industrialization. Israel's investment in the development of
agricultural technology accounts for 30 percent of the country's
GNP.
</P>
<P>
China is now in great need of fostering farm products
processing companies and furthering agricultural technological
improvement, said Xuan Zengpei, adding that China should increase
economic and technological exchanges as well as cooperation with
foreign countries.

ATHENS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greenpeace organization in
Greece Thursday criticized the U.S. Senate's vote opposing the
ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on
nuclear weapons, saying the decision has "torpedoed" international
efforts to ban nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Thursday, Greenpeace said the U.S.
Senate has begun a new cycle of "nuclear terrorism" and given the
green light to other countries with nuclear capability to ignore
the world's desire for a definitive end to the "nuclear nightmare.
"
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace Campaign Director Nikos Haralambidis said the U.S.
refusal to ratify entails the collapse of the treaty, which has to
date been signed by 154 countries.

<HEADLINE> UK's FSA Consults On Permission Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) - British Financial Services
Authority (FSA) issued a consultation paper Thursday outlining the
next stage of development of the single authorization process.
</P>
<P>
It covers granting firms permission to carry on regulated
activities, offer certain types of investments and deal with
certain types of customer.
</P>
<P>
The paper asks for feedback on the implementation of procedural
clauses in the Financial Services and Markets Bill and on the
content and method of publication of the public record of firms
and products which are regulated by the FSA.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Services and Markets Bill received its Second
Reading in the House of Commons on 28 June and is expected to
become law during the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
David Kenmir, the FSA's Authorization Director, said: "The
permission regime, in conjunction with the Qualifying Conditions
for Authorization, is an important part of the FSA's regulatory
approach."
</P>
<P>
"Firms will only be allowed to undertake activities if they are
fit and proper to do so. This will contribute directly to the
FSA's market confidence and consumer protection objectives," he
added.

LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) - Fitch IBCA assigned Thursday
investment grade foreign currency ratings to Bank of Asia (BOA) at
'BBB-' Long-term and 'F3' Short-term.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the international rating agency also affirmed
BOA's Individual and Support ratings at 'D/E' and '3',
respectively.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Rise Slightly in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose just
0.1 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted 253.4 billion U.
S. dollars, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The September increase, slightly worse than expected, followed
a revised 1.5 percent gain in August. But total retail sales have
held steady most months of this year and were 10.5 percent higher
than September of last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said last month's performance may be a sign that the
Federal Reserve's two interest rate increases are beginning to
slow consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The consumer sector is being supported by the lowest
unemployment rate in nearly three decades, a 4.2 percent level
that has given more workers cash to spend.
</P>
<P>
Overall retail sales were held back by a 1.3 decline in sales
of new cars and trucks by automobile dealerships in September.
That followed a strong 3.1 percent increase the month before. The
auto industry is anticipating a record sales year in 1999.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales rose a
brisk 0.6 percent in September. Many analysts were expecting a 0.5
percent gain.
</P>
<P>
Last month, sales at apparel and accessory stores dropped 0.9
percent following a 1.2 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
Also, sales at hardware and building supply stores were down 0.
6 percent in September despite Hurricane Floyd, which raked the
East Coast last month. That category, which also includes mobile
home dealers, posted a 0.4 percent gain in August.
</P>
<P>
However, the report showed that sales at furniture and home
furnishing stores posted a solid 1.2 percent increase in September
after 0.7 percent gain in August.
</P>
<P>
The biggest gain in September came from sales at gasoline
stations, which were up 2.4 percent reflecting rising energy
prices. That followed a 2.7 percent rise in August.
</P>
<P>
The nation's biggest retailers last week reported that sales
rose modestly in September as the robust U.S. economy continued to
encourage shoppers to spend despite volatility in the stock market,
rising interest rates and the hurricane.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Mourns Death of Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Thursday sent his condolences to Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa on the death of former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his condolences to and sympathy for the Tanzanian
government on behalf of the OAU, Salim spoke highly of Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
The late Tanzanian leader dedicated his life to the cause of
freedom, independence and unity, as well as the socio-economic
development of Africa, Salim said.
</P>
<P>
"His tireless crusade for liberation, and the leadership he
gave to the struggle as president of Tanzanian and Chairman of the
Frontline States, was substantial in the defeat of colonialism and
apartheid," the OAU chief noted.
</P>
<P>
The death of Nyerere, one of the founding fathers of the OAU
and one of Africa's wise men, "is an irreparable loss and a void
that will be difficult to fill," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has lost an ardent advocate of its unity and
indefatigable defender of the freedom and dignity of its people,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere died of leukemia in a London hospital on Thursday
morning at the age of 77.

<HEADLINE> UK's Main Political Parties Unite on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
launched Thursday the Britain in Europe campaign, which shows the
greatest cross-party support on European issues since the
referendum of 1975.
</P>
<P>
Blair said it would be "madness" to shut the door on the euro,
adding that backing a UK committed to the future of the European
Union was a "patriotic" cause.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am proud to be part of a gathering that stretches
across all political parties and none to make our case for Britain
in Europe to our country."
</P>
<P>
Joining the Prime Minister on the launching were the former
Tory Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and former Chancellor
Ken Clarke, as well as the Liberal Democrat leader Charles
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine said: "I stand on this platform with Ken Clarke this
morning because all our lives we have shared that same belief in a
combination of practical, national self-interest with political
vision which has guided our party for half a century."
</P>
<P>
Clarke was more straightforward. "Everybody who has joined this
campaign is in favor of the single currency in principle. None of
us are saying we should join now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office insisted the campaign did not
signal any departure from the government's "prepare and decide"
policy on the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Any decision to recommend membership in a referendum would
depend on the government's five economic criteria for joining
being met, it said.

<HEADLINE> Three-Fourths of Pakistanis Support Army Action: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Approximately three out of
four Pakistanis supported the army action to dismiss the
government led by Nawaz Sharif, shows a snap poll conducted by
Gallup Pakistan in various cities of the country on the evening of
October 13.
</P>
<P>
The poll findings should, however, be read with the caution
that opinions on such issues can be quite volatile and may change
fairly rapidly in response to the unfolding situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll results released Thursday, some 75
percent of those sampled approved the action taken by the army.
But only one-third favored direct military rule and the remaining
two-thirds supported a civilian government.
</P>
<P>
From within civilian choices, 75 percent favored a government
comprising non-political reputable experts; support for returning
government to Pakistan Muslim League (PML) leaders including
Sharif is less than 10 percent, and support for forming a national
government of respectable politicians of political parties is
around 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the initial response within hours of the military action,
when asked would they favor an election in less than 90 days or
after two or three days, around 60 percent chose the latter.
</P>
<P>
Concerning expectations from the post-Sharif setup a majority
were not very hopeful of a turnaround in the economic situation;
only 25 percent were hopeful of a respite in inflation or
unemployment. But around 80 percent were hopeful that the law and
order situation will improve.
</P>
<P>
The survey findings nevertheless reveal that despite the
widespread approval of Sharif's removal from office, PML is still
the largest single vote bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
Those who said they would still vote for PML in a future
election outnumber any other political party in the country.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted with a randomly drawn sample of over
850 men and women in the urban areas of the country.

Zemin Thursday sent a message of condolences to his Tanzanian
counterpart Benjamin Mkapa mourning the death of founder of the
east African nation Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>

At this sad moment, I wish to express, on behalf of the Chinese
government and people and in my own name, deep condolences and

international activist widely renowned in Africa and the world at
large," Jiang remarked.
</P>

"He has dedicated his whole life to the great cause of
independence and progress of Tanzania and the African continent,
and has played an important role in the promotion of South-South
Co-operation and South-North Dialogue.

Nyerere has made precious contributions to the maintenance and
promotion of the Sino-Tanzanian friendship over the years. His
death has resulted a loss of a longstanding friend of the Chinese
people, whom we greatly regret and feel sorry for," the Chinese
President said in the message.
</P>

Jiang added,"I herewith have the honor to express my
willingness to join Your Excellency in our concerted efforts to

relations and co-operation that were created and nurtured jointly

<HEADLINE> U.N. Experts Report Serious Pollution in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.N.
environment experts Thursday said that they have detected serious
pollution and called for "immediate clean-up action" in Serbia, a
Yugoslav republic which was hardest-hit by 78-day NATO air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was contained in a report issued here Thursday by
the Balkan Task Force (BTF) jointly organized by the United
Nations Environment Program and the U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (UNCHS/Habitat), which conducted a fact-finding work
in four environmental "hot spots" in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"Pollution detected at four environmental 'hot spots' is
serious and poses a threat to human health," a UNEP press release
said. The four sites are in Pancevo, Kragujevac, Novi Sad and Bor
in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"At these sites, all in Serbia, immediate clean-up action,
which should be seen as a part of humanitarian assistance to the
region, is called for," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
The BTF report, entitled "The Kosovo Conflict -- Consequences
for the Environment and Human Settlements," also concludes that in
Kosovo the human settlement problem is not just about
reconstructing houses, but a question of establishing
administrative procedures that will give people security of
tenure.
</P>
<P>
"In a post-conflict situation, such a neutral, objective and
scientific assessment of the real situation on the ground is
essential," said Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the UNEP and
UNCHS.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the humanitarian aid to the region, the
international community should assist the relevant authorities in
dealing with the key environmental hot spots, thus avoiding
further harm to human health and the environment in Yugoslavia and
the wider Balkans region," said Pekka Haavisto, the former Finnish
Environment and Development Cooperation Minister, who is on the
BTF.
</P>
<P>
Without the authorisation of the U.N. Security Council, NATO
began air strikes on March 24 on Yugoslavia, a sovereign member of
the U.N. family, seriously violating the U.N. Charter and
international law, and also causing serious environmental problems
in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Cape Verde Launches Campaign Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Cape Verde Thursday launched the
National Program of Combatting Poverty, Angola's official news
agency Angop reported.
</P>
<P>
As part of Cape Verde's national development plan, the
ambitious anti- poverty program is aimed at a sustained and
durable reduction of poverty from which 30 percent of the
country's population have been suffering.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, women who are responsible for
subsistence in Cape Verde's families, manual-labor workers,
unemployed and young people are targets of the program.
</P>
<P>
With 50 percent of the initial finances guaranteed by the World
Bank, the four-year program can be prolonged because the whole
campaign against poverty is very complicated.
</P>
<P>
The program provides the country's projects up to 30,000 Cape
Verde contos (300,000 U.S. dollars), will averagely consume 1.5
million contos (15 million dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde, a west African archipelago state and one of the
poorest countries in the world, is in scarcity of mineral
resources for future industrial development.

<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan
refused to believe his side already have one foot in next year's
Euro 2000 Championship finals after the mouthwatering play-off
draw with Scotland.
</P>
<P>
England have been installed as favorites to beat the Auld Enemy
in next month's two-legged tie, particularly because Keegan's side
have home advantage for the return.
</P>
<P>
When the draw was made in Aachen,Germany Wednesday morning,
with Scotland and England the first names to be revealed, Keegan
shook his head in disbelief as a wry smile creased his lips.
</P>
<P>
It is a match which will immediately capture the imagination of
the public, with England having recently had the last laugh on the
Scots following their Euro 96 success when goals from Alan Shearer
and Paul Gascoigne sealed a typically dramatic victory.
</P>
<P>
But Keegan knows that clash will have no bearing on the
forthcoming matches as he said: "It was a great game, and the
result was right.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at Euro 96 and the game there, it was the most
fantastic advert for football between the two nations. So a
repeat of that twice won't do any harm at all - in fact it will do
only good.
</P>
<P>
"But that's gone now; it's in the past. The personnel have
changed, and not just the manager but also a lot of the players.
</P>
<P>
"But some of the players, even the experienced English ones,
will not have played against Scotland before. It will be a new
experience for them," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ireland "Happy Enough" To Play Turks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Republic of Ireland soccer team
manager Mick McCarthy put a brave face on his team's tough Euro
2000 play-off draw against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It means the Irish will have their hopes of reaching the finals
next summer decided among the boiling hostility of Istanbul when
the second leg is played on Wednesday, November 17.
</P>
<P>
But McCarthy said: "It is the team we will be playing against,
not anything else. I'm happy enough with the draw because we
avoided the ones I wanted to avoid - England, because of all the
hype that would have entailed; and Ukraine, because they are by
far the best team in the play-offs with two great strikers in
Andriy Shevchenko and Sergi Rebrov."
</P>
<P>
Turkey beat Euro 96 champions Germany 1-0 in Group Three a year
ago and were assured of runners-up place before earning only a
goalless draw in the return in Munich on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
They also twice beat Northern Ireland 3-0. But McCarthy, who
will seek pointers on the Turks from Northern Ireland boss Lawrie
McMenemy, said: "The biggest disappointment is that we are playing
the away leg second, but Turkey won't fancy coming to Dublin
either.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever way you look at it you know it is going to be down to
who performs best on the day. It may be a difficult trip for our
fans to Istanbul - but even if we have to go there with just the
squad of 22 we'll give it a real go."
</P>
<P>
Ireland's last meeting with Turkey was on November 13, 1991 in
the final European Championship qualifier in Istanbul when Jack
Charlton's team - with McCarthy at center-back - won 3-1 thanks to
two goals by John Byrne of Sunderland and another by Tony
Cascarino who, now 37, is just one goal short of the all-time
Republic record of 20.
</P>
<P>
It was a magnificent performance by Ireland but not enough to
earn them a place in the finals in Sweden because England's draw
in Poland on the same night won the group. There were no play-offs
for second-placed teams then.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Scotland manager Craig Brown is
savoring the prospect of a two-legged play-off against England to
secure a place at Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Brown's team were the first name out of the hat and will face
the Auld Enemy for the first time since the 2-0 Euro 96 defeat at
Wembley, with Alan Shearer and Paul Gascoigne scoring for England
and Gary McAllister missing a crucial penalty.
</P>
<P>
But Brown said: "I am not surprised by the draw and I'm quite
relaxed about it. I think the England team were stronger in Euro
96 and I don't think we need fear them."
</P>
<P>
He added: "The unfortunate thing for England is that one of us
has to go through. Of course we are not under-estimating them;
England are very strong in attack and have great experience at the
back.
</P>
<P>
"We are just hoping we get everybody fit for the two games, and
they should be a couple of great matches."
</P>
<P>
The first match against England is due to be played at Hampden
Park on November 13, with the return leg at Wembley the following
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Brown said: "We are lucky the new stadium is now complete, and
there will be a full house. It should be a wonderful atmosphere
and a wonderful occasion."
</P>
<P>
He intends to take in a number of Premiership games in England
in the next month, along with his number two Alex Miller who is
now scouting for Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
"I know most of the England players - but one or two I'm unsure
about, like Frank Lampard. It would be good to see them at first
hand."

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Improve Drainage System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
decided to overhaul sewage and drainage systems in capital
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Committee on national economy has endorsed
the city council's request for a 5.4-million-U.S. dollar loan from
the World Bank, Radio Uganda reported Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The legislature will try to ask the world financial institution
to release the loan before November 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor John Ssebaana Kizito, the money will be used
to build Nakivubo Channel Project and improve the drainage systems
which have been neglected for many years.
</P>
<P>
Kampala's roads are characterized by deep potholes and poor
quality. The drainage system is so poor that there is almost
always flooding after a downpour. The flooding causes halt of
business, traffic jams and power breakdown.
</P>
<P>
There have been loud outcries for the improvement of the
infrastructures such as road and drainage in Kampala.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Orders DNA Tests On Pantani Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 13 (Xinhua) -- An Italian prosecutor ordered DNA
tests on the blood of Marco Pantani, the Italian cycling star
Marco Pantani, who was banned from the Giro d"Italia or Tour of
Italy in June after failing a blood test.
</P>
<P>
The random tests showed his count of red cells exceeded the
legal level of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Bruno Giardina's office said in Trento, Italy on
Wednesday that the tests were intended to prove if the blood
samples actually belonged to Pantani and if tests that led to
Pantani's ban from the race were properly handled by the ICU
medical staff.
</P>
<P>
Tests might also reveal if the samples taken from Pantani and
10 other cyclists on the eve of the race's next-to-last stage
contained natural or artificial substances.
</P>
<P>
Pantani, a double Giro and Tour of France winner in 1998, was
suspended for two weeks and prevented from completing the Giro
which he was dominating.
</P>
<P>
A high count of red blood cells might signal the use of the
banned growth hormone EPO, but can also occur naturally.
</P>
<P>
Pantani has not been competing since his suspension in the Giro
but said recently he planned to return from a knee injury to
action next year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Wilt Chamberlain died of
heart failure, the great basketballer's agent Sy Goldberg said
Wednesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"He had congestive heart failure," Goldberg said the day after
Chamberlain died at age 63. "He had deteriorated relatively
quickly over the last month or so."
</P>
<P>
Michele Hamilton, associate clinical professor of cardiology at
UCLA, said: "Most likely, with a man of his age group dying
suddenly, it would be from blockage in the blood vessels, causing
an irregular heartbeat, regardless of his past medical history."
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Chamberlain are scheduled for Saturday.
Chamberlain's sister, Barbara Lewis, said her brother had
undergone dental surgery last week and looked worse than she had
ever seen him.
</P>
<P>
The greatest basketball player ever in the world scored a
record 100 points in a game against the New York Knicks on March 2,
1962. He also snatched a record of 55 rebounds against the Boston
Celtics on November 24, 1960.
</P>
<P>
He scored 31,419 points and grabbed a record 23,924 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Makes High Debut at Gymnastics World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is looking forward to a
historic bronze medal after they vaulted to a flying start in the
women's horse vault qualifying competition of the world gymnastics
championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Denisse Lopez entered the finals after finishing third
in the qualifiers and became the first world championships
finalist in the nation's 72-year history in the sport.
</P>
<P>
The surprising delight came when the country fielded both men's
and women's teams for world championships for the first time in
the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
It was a great encouragement to Sanchez, president of the
Mexico Gymnastics Federation who took the post two months ago.
</P>
<P>
"I were just elected two months ago, and I think it is really
hard to come here, so we make analysis of the situation and got
the best gymnasts of the country," said Sanchez. "We also got
support from the sponsors, so we have the responsibility to work
hard."
</P>
<P>
"Before the games we had a target of one qualifier for the 2000
Sydney Olympics, now we did that," said Sanchez. "It means a lot
for us. The government is going to put more attention into our
program."
</P>
<P>
"It was really a good news for the Mexicans, for the team are
still young and inexperienced," Sanchez said of his country whose
gymnastics program started from scratch 72 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"If she can win a medal, even a bronze medal, Mexico will have
a fiesta, a bigger party," Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
But Rome is not built overnight as the country has geared up
for international glory although it remains a big challenge for
them to get further.
</P>
<P>
"In the past there were no gymnastics programs in public
schools but in the past three years the government have started to
put in the programs. For us gymnastics is everything, it is the
basics of the sports."
</P>
<P>
They also have foreign coaches to get the gymnastics wilderness
updated with the development of the sport and produced good local
coaches which have been a far cry for them.
</P>
<P>
"Russian coaches came to give us advice and classes, Cuban
coaches stayed for one year through the interchange program, and
we have 35 Bulgarian coaches all over the country," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
After seeing China ended up with the men's team gold and women'
s team bronze, Sanchez has turned his eyes on the Chinese coaches.
</P>
<P>
"I will start talking with the Chinese coaches, and tomorrow I
will go to the Mexican Embassy in Beijing and talk with the
ambassador about this. I know between China and Mexico we have
interchange program," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was also aware of the problem that gymnastics is still
an amateur sport in his country.
</P>
<P>
"We maybe not good at basketball or wrestling, but our
constitution is good enough to play soccer, cycling and gymnastics.
And they are also talented.
</P>
<P>
"But they need time to work. It is hard for most of them are
University students. They can only spend five or six hours a day.
</P>
<P>
"Our federation has talked with the parents and principles of
universities and tried to persuade them to allow time for the
gymnasts. So in a sense parents and head of the universities are
also part of the team for the championships. We cannot do without
their support," said Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
But the ambitious president expressed his full confidence to
have a strong team in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I think in the next Olympic cycle we will be more motivated,
more experienced with more international competition."
</P>
<P>
A philosophy is the thing that stands behind him.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing impossible in this world and the only thing
that have no solution is death," he added.

<HEADLINE> Neck-injured Mexican Gymnast Discharged from Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Mexican gymnast Aleman Manuel,
who had injured his neck during an exercise last Saturday, was
discharged from hospital on Thursday, said Jose Pilar Sanchez,
head of the Mexican delegation on Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
After aborative treatment in the hospital, Manuel is likely to
resume regular training within two months.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican fell and lost consciousness during a floor exercise
warm-up Saturday afternoon at the on-going world championships
here. After courtside emergency treatment, he was rushed to
hospital in 15 minutes, according to championships' doctor-in-
chief Liu Keqiang.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, who is also the president of the Mexican Gymnastics
Federation, paid his gratitude to Tianjin and "all the beautiful
people here".
</P>
<P>
"The emergency service was efficient and Manuel was lucky
having such a good treatment after the injury," Sanchez said. "He
had 24-hour service a day in the hospital."
</P>
<P>
The accident reminded of a similar one involving Chinese woman
teenager gymnast Sang Lan, who had her neck broken when she fell
head first during a vaulting warm-up at the Goodwill Games last
July in New York and was paralyzed since then.
</P>
<P>
Manuel, however, did not hurt his nerves in the spine.
</P>
<P>
Manuel was the most serious among the four injuries at the
championships here. Among others, Yong Chol Ri from South Korea
strained his right ankle during the men's vault competition. He
is expected to be fully recovered in six weeks.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President to Play Soccer in Weekend Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni will play in a soccer match at the Mandela National
Stadium here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The match between the Cabinet XI and the Federation of Uganda
Football Association (FUFA) XI will serve as a curtain raiser for
an Olympic qualifier between Uganda U-23 Kobs and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The president used to be a sportsman and he loved to played
football in his secondary school years. Even when he was in
Entebbe, he played football with children, although he was now
forced to play much less due to his heavy official duties,
Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua in a
telephone interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni is said to captain the Cabinet side that takes on the
ex-internationals in the FUFA XI.
</P>
<P>
The president accepted an invitation for the match in order to
encourage Uganda soccer fraternity. He is a sportsman and wants
to prove that, Thursday's New Vision daily reported quoting FUFA
Secretary Godfrey Kisekka.
</P>
<P>
The invitation follows a challenge from the president that
local sports officials organize a match in which he would play
instead of being invited to the stadium as a spectator, the
newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Grandi: Degree of Difficulty Can't Grow without Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Acrobatics or Artistry? Which
choice should gymnastics take for its future?
</P>
<P>
"We prefer the balance between them and will control the degree
of difficulty with new scoring rules," said Bruno Grandi,
president of the International Gymnastics Federation, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We will take into account both the factor of execution and
degree of difficulty when we are developing the new rules for
judging," said the president who has brought gymnastics under
reform since he came into power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There have been mixed reactions to the to-be-finalized new Code
of Points which de facto has encouraged the gymnasts to pursue
more difficult routines.
</P>
<P>
"Gymnastics has made some progress in terms of difficulty
degree, but the unbridled development in degree of difficulty can
not go too far,"said Grandi.
</P>
<P>
The president advised gymnasts not to rely on tricks to win
because they will be likely to miss both artistry and technique at
one time.
</P>
<P>
"Not everyone can perform difficult tricks and sometimes the
poorly performed routines will backfire and destroy the cleanness
and elegance."
</P>
<P>
He said that the FIG will control the development of the very
difficult tricks for it is "dangerous and will tarnish the image
of the gymnastics".
</P>
<P>
But this is not the only reason why he aims to put the degree
of difficulty under rein.
</P>
<P>
"The tricks may surprise you but it will not last long. While
the artistry can impress the spectators for quite a long time. So
to keep the vitality and vigor of gymnastics we need to be
artistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Like the landing on the moon it might create a sensation but
just lasts for some time. It is the same case with gymnastics
whose tricks may become commonplace as more and more gymnasts can
perform it."
</P>
<P>
"What makes gymnastics distinct from the other sports is their
artistic and cultural aspects." the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the FIG will work out rules and
regulations for scoring and all gymnasts are expected to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
"Now the problem is that the scoring rules have been led by the
abnormal development in the degree of difficulty. We should let
them meet the requirements of the rules and not the other way
around."
</P>
<P>
When asked if Svetlana Khorkina of Russia, who is famous more
for artistry than tricks, will be one of the models for the future
direction of gymnastics, the president said:"Why not?"

<HEADLINE> Romanian Maria Olaru Claims Women's All-Around Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A new generation of gymnasts
stole the limelight by impeccable performance as Maria Olaru of
Romania rallied to win the women's all-around title at the
gymnastics World Championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Olaru, the hottest contender for the title,
surged to claim the victory with an aggregate score of 38.774
points, followed by Vyctoria Karpenko of Ukraine in 38.705 and
Elena Zamolodchikova of Russia 38.687, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Today's competition is in a way that looks like the team final
on Tuesday because it is until the last apparatus that the final
result is clear, " said the Romanian head coach Octavian Bellu.
</P>
<P>
Olaru, 1.61cm, silver medalist at Goodwill Games in the United
States last year, planted her name into everyone's heart when she
led through the qualifying ground and team final with flawless
routines, of which were all above 9.600 points.
</P>
<P>
However, she placed seventh after her first rotation on the
uneven bars in today's finals, fourth after the beam in 9.737, and
second overall before she scored a decisive 9.625 in the last
apparatus of the vault. The score was good enough for her to edge
pace-setter Karpenko by 0.69 points for the title.
</P>
<P>
Karpenko led after the third rotation, suffered a weak vault of
9.493 points and had to settle for the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Elena Produnova of Russia won the fourth in 38.
675, ahead of Andreea Raducan of Romania 38.617. Chinese Dong
Fangxiao and Huang Mandan ranked fifth and sixth in 38.143 and 38.
018, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Svetlana Khorkina of Russia finished a
distant 12th for 37.611 points, while her long-time rival Simona
Amanar of Romania, Atlanta Olympics vault champion and all-around
runner-up in 1997, ranked 14th overall with 37.299.
</P>
<P>
Amanar, third overall before her lethal falling down from the
uneven bars, her last apparatus, slipt away the chance of winning
the title.
</P>
<P>
"Time has changed and the young are pushing the experienced who
are tired to resist the pressure, like Simona Amanar and Khorkina.
But the young are hungry for the medals and success," Bellu said.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply respect Simona and Khorkina, They will be in the
2000 Olympics, it is a great credit to them, " added Bellu.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Marina Boulachenko agreed with legend Romanian
coach Bellu and said: "One defeat does not tell everything of
stars like Khorkina and Amanar. And I'm sure them are to come back
at the Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Gymnasts: Like Father Like Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Gymnastics is believed to be a
sport of talents and  usually a family heredity leads young
gymnasts to the way of success.
</P>
<P>
That's true in the current Tianjin world championships when
gymnastics family got together with fathers and son and daughters
competing and coaching under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
Japan's leading gymnast Naoya Tsukahara is the son of Tsukahara,
the 1972 Olympic and 1970 world champion and inventor of the
Tsukahara Vault and Tsukahara Dismount of High Bar. The junior
Tsukahara tried every effort to emulate his famous father and led
the Japanese men's team to a fourth place in the final.
</P>
<P>
Naoya's teammate Akihiro Kasamatsu also came from a famous
gymnastics family. Akihiro's father, Shigeru Kasamatsu, will never
be forgotten because of the tragedy in 1976 Montreal Olympic Games,
where the senior Kasamatsu had to undergo an appendix operation
just days prior to what should have been his Olympic gold medal
competition.
</P>
<P>
But Akihiro and Naoya, the "brothers in arms", will try to
retrieve their family glory and spearhead the Japanese team to the
medal podium in next year's Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Besides the father-son gymnasts, great coaches also have a role
to play to guide their children to be the world class gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Carballo, a former national coach for the Spanish men's
and women's team, is the father of the 1996 world champion on high
bar Jesus Carballo-Junior.
</P>
<P>
Jana Komrskova of Czech Republic surged into the all-around
competition as a surprise. Jana is named after her father, Jan
Komrskov, who is the Czech national coach and was used to
dominating the world with star gymnast Vera Caslavska.
</P>
<P>
Yewki Yomita, 19, the youngest gymnast in the United States
team in Tianjin, who competed in the Individual all-around final
on Thursday, is also coached by his father Yoichi Yomita, who
competed for the American national team in 1979-80.
</P>
<P>
Krisztian Jordanov is one of the best gymnasts in the Hungarian
team. He was so sad about his team's failure to qualify for the
Sydney Olympic Games by finishing 13th in the team final. The
coach who comforted him was his father, Zoltan Jordanov, whose
father and Krisztian's grandfather, Dimitar Vassilev, was in fact
the first outstanding gymnast in the family. Dimitar competed in
the 1952 Olympic Games with the Bulgarian team.

<HEADLINE> Unsung Russian Steals Spotlight from Favorites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The lead alternated between
favorites until it finally settled at unheralded Russian Nikolay
Krukov, who beat a strong field to claim the individual men's all-
round title Thursday at the 34th world championships here.
</P>
<P>
Krukov, who finished first in parallel bars and high bar at the
World University Games in earlier summer this year, fought back to
take the blue-ribbon title on a total of 57.485 points.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe what had happened," said Krukov after the
medal awarding ceremony, "I won the all-around title!"
</P>
<P>
Naoya Tsukahara of Japan also came from behind to finish runner-
up on a total of 57.337.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Jordan Jovtchev, who placed fourth at Atlanta and
third at European Championships in 1998, came in third with 57.212.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy with Nikolay's results and all those guys who
performed today," said Arkavevf Lenoid, head coach of Russia team.
</P>
<P>
It was really not the day for Ivan Ivankov of Belarus, the
defending champion, who withdrew form the competition after he
finished 7.795 points in the horizontal bar.
</P>
<P>
The guy has been poised to make history as he will become the
first three-time world champion in the all-round competition with
a gold medal but all this turned out to be only a dream.
</P>
<P>
But the result did not become clear until the last moment after
several pre-game heavy favorites failed to keep the lead for more
than one rotation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Lu Yufu, who placed sixth at the 1997 worlds, started
strong by finishing first at the first rotation only to see
Atlanta Olympics champion Alexei Nemov of Russia displace him in
the provisional rankings. He finally won 57.086 to finish fifth.
</P>
<P>
Nemov's upsurge proved to be a flash as the Russian had his
winning momentum broken at the third rotation where he only earned
only 8.737 on the rings with a start value judged only at 9.50.
</P>
<P>
The Russian continued his slump as he finished at last at sixth
on 56.793 points.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian top gymnast Jovtchev, who placed fourth at Atlanta
and third at European championships in 1998, stole the lead from
Nemov at the third rotation when he scored 9.600 at the pommel
horse.
</P>
<P>
But he failed to pull away as Huang Xu, the runner-up at the
1997 worlds, surged to top the fourth rotation as he impressed the
partisan crowd with a good execution and solid landing to finish 9.
725 points on parallel bars. Huang Xu finally only placed 11th on
56.660.
</P>
<P>
While the Chinese lead could not last long as Krukov began to
show his teeth at the next round of competition by wrapping up
with 9.637 at the horizontal bar and became the men who smiled to
the last.
</P>
<P>
Yang Wei, who qualified first in the event, started badly as he
failed in the pommel horse and came in 12th on 56.573.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud of my gymnasts, especially Yang Wei, who topped
qualifiers but suffered slump in the first rotation tonight. He
won himself in the meet," said Huang Yubin, head coach of the
Chinese team, who won the men's team title with a overwhelming 230.
395 points, holding a big margin of 2.250 points over runners-up
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"All our three boys, Yang Wei, Huang Xu and Lu Yufu had chance
to take the title," said Huang Yubin,"but they all made fatal
mistakes. So we'll have to improve our training quality when we
start to prepare for next year's Sydney Olympic Games."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President to Play Soccer in Weekend Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni will play in a soccer match at the Mandela National
Stadium here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The match between the Cabinet XI and the Federation of Uganda
Football Association (FUFA) XI will serve as a curtain raiser for
an Olympic qualifier between Uganda U-23 Kobs and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The president used to be a sportsman and he loved to played
football in his secondary school years. Even when he was in
Entebbe, he played football with children, although he was now
forced to play much less due to his heavy official duties,
Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua in a
telephone interview on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni is said to captain the Cabinet side that takes on the
ex-internationals in the FUFA XI.
</P>
<P>
The president accepted an invitation for the match in order to
encourage Uganda soccer fraternity. He is a sportsman and wants
to prove that, Thursday's New Vision daily reported quoting FUFA
Secretary Godfrey Kisekka.
</P>
<P>
The invitation follows a challenge from the president that
local sports officials organize a match in which he would play
instead of being invited to the stadium as a spectator, the
newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Maria Olaru Claims Women's All-Around Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A new generation of gymnasts
stole the limelight by impeccable performance as Maria Olaru of
Romania rallied to win the women's all-around title at the
gymnastics World Championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Olaru, the hottest contender for the title,
surged to claim the victory with an aggregate score of 38.774
points, followed by Vyctoria Karpenko of Ukraine in 38.705 and
Elena Zamolodchikova of Russia 38.687, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Today's competition is in a way that looks like the team final
on Tuesday because it is until the last apparatus that the final
result is clear, " said the Romanian head coach Octavian Bellu.
</P>
<P>
Olaru, 1.61cm, silver medalist at Goodwill Games in the United
States last year, planted her name into everyone's heart when she
led through the qualifying ground and team final with flawless
routines, of which were all above 9.600 points.
</P>
<P>
However, she placed seventh after her first rotation on the
uneven bars in today's finals, fourth after the beam in 9.737, and
second overall before she scored a decisive 9.625 in the last
apparatus of the vault. The score was good enough for her to edge
pace-setter Karpenko by 0.69 points for the title.
</P>
<P>
Karpenko led after the third rotation, suffered a weak vault of
9.493 points and had to settle for the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Elena Produnova of Russia won the fourth in 38.
675, ahead of Andreea Raducan of Romania 38.617. Chinese Dong
Fangxiao and Huang Mandan ranked fifth and sixth in 38.143 and 38.
018, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Svetlana Khorkina of Russia finished a
distant 12th for 37.611 points, while her long-time rival Simona
Amanar of Romania, Atlanta Olympics vault champion and all-around
runner-up in 1997, ranked 14th overall with 37.299.
</P>
<P>
Amanar, third overall before her lethal falling down from the
uneven bars, her last apparatus, slipt away the chance of winning
the title.
</P>
<P>
"Time has changed and the young are pushing the experienced who
are tired to resist the pressure, like Simona Amanar and Khorkina.
But the young are hungry for the medals and success," Bellu said.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply respect Simona and Khorkina, They will be in the
2000 Olympics, it is a great credit to them, " added Bellu.
</P>
<P>
Russian coach Marina Boulachenko agreed with legend Romanian
coach Bellu and said: "One defeat does not tell everything of
stars like Khorkina and Amanar. And I'm sure them are to come back
at the Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Gymnasts: Like Father Like Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Gymnastics is believed to be a
sport of talents and  usually a family heredity leads young
gymnasts to the way of success.
</P>
<P>
That's true in the current Tianjin world championships when
gymnastics family got together with fathers and son and daughters
competing and coaching under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
Japan's leading gymnast Naoya Tsukahara is the son of Tsukahara,
the 1972 Olympic and 1970 world champion and inventor of the
Tsukahara Vault and Tsukahara Dismount of High Bar. The junior
Tsukahara tried every effort to emulate his famous father and led
the Japanese men's team to a fourth place in the final.
</P>
<P>
Naoya's teammate Akihiro Kasamatsu also came from a famous
gymnastics family. Akihiro's father, Shigeru Kasamatsu, will never
be forgotten because of the tragedy in 1976 Montreal Olympic Games,
where the senior Kasamatsu had to undergo an appendix operation
just days prior to what should have been his Olympic gold medal
competition.
</P>
<P>
But Akihiro and Naoya, the "brothers in arms", will try to
retrieve their family glory and spearhead the Japanese team to the
medal podium in next year's Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Besides the father-son gymnasts, great coaches also have a role
to play to guide their children to be the world class gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Carballo, a former national coach for the Spanish men's
and women's team, is the father of the 1996 world champion on high
bar Jesus Carballo-Junior.
</P>
<P>
Jana Komrskova of Czech Republic surged into the all-around
competition as a surprise. Jana is named after her father, Jan
Komrskov, who is the Czech national coach and was used to
dominating the world with star gymnast Vera Caslavska.
</P>
<P>
Yewki Yomita, 19, the youngest gymnast in the United States
team in Tianjin, who competed in the Individual all-around final
on Thursday, is also coached by his father Yoichi Yomita, who
competed for the American national team in 1979-80.
</P>
<P>
Krisztian Jordanov is one of the best gymnasts in the Hungarian
team. He was so sad about his team's failure to qualify for the
Sydney Olympic Games by finishing 13th in the team final. The
coach who comforted him was his father, Zoltan Jordanov, whose
father and Krisztian's grandfather, Dimitar Vassilev, was in fact
the first outstanding gymnast in the family. Dimitar competed in
the 1952 Olympic Games with the Bulgarian team.

<HEADLINE> Boeing 100-Seat Jets Arouse Interest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 717-200 regional jet, a
new member of the Boeing plane family, today ended its four-day
showcase tour in China after a number of Chinese air companies
announced their intention to buy the aircraft for their fleets.
</P>
<P>
The 100-seat plane, designed for short-distance passenger
flights, has been the star attraction in seven air shows in
Beijing, Wuhan, Kunming and Xiamen since last Sunday, when the jet
arrived in Beijing from the United States.
</P>
<P>
A dozen Chinese airlines, including Wuhan, Yunnan, Shenzhen and
Xiamen air companies, have shown interest in the regional jets and
three of them have expressed their intent to purchase.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the jet successfully took off at Tianhe
International Airport in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, despite rain and visibility of less than 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
"We will buy five such planes," Cheng Yaokun, general manager
of Wuhan Air Company, told Ray Bracy, President of Boeing China
Inc.
</P>
<P>
"The regional jet costs less to fly, produces little noise, and
demonstrates fine safety performance. It will suit our company
that operates a great number of regional air services," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province where
air service is brisk, Duan Shenghu, flight engineer-in-chief with
Yunnan Air Company, attended two air shows featuring the jet in
one day.
</P>
<P>
"I have been responsible for purchase of regional planes for 15
years and I found the new Boeing regional jet has demonstrated
good capabilities and is well equipped," Duan said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, all 21 planes of his company are from the
Boeing airplane family. But the company is still short of planes
suited to short-distance flights within Yunnan Province, a
mountainous region which abounds in tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
Regional planes are those that have flight distance ranging
from 500 km to 1,500 km and have about 100 seats each.
</P>
<P>
In the next two decades, the world will need 2,600 planes each
with seats ranging from 80 to 120, but the need for big planes
like the Boeing 747 only stands at 930, according to specialists.
Therefore, developing regional planes featuring good capabilities
and low operation costs will become an important field where the
world's plane manufacturers will compete fiercely.
</P>
<P>
Research on Boeing 717-200 passenger planes started in 1995.
The first such aircraft was delivered in September this year. Air
companies from the United States and Europe have placed orders for
128 Boeing 717-200 planes, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Nations Issue Antelope Conservation Declaration in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The international community took
the first bold step forward here today to coordinate efforts in
the fight against rampant poaching and smuggling of Tibetan
antelope, one of the world's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Seven countries jointly issued the Xining Declaration on the
Conservation and Control of Trade in Tibetan Antelope in this
capital city of northwest China's Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
The declaration describes in detail the responsibilities of the
countries concerned in protecting the endangered species and
controlling the trade of products made from the animal.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the governments of the countries to support this
move by providing necessary funds, technology and material aid. It
also urges the countries that process and sell cashmere products
to increase publicity about the conservation of Tibetan antelope.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was jointly issued by more than 80
representatives from government organs, non-government
organizations and experts from China, France, India, Italy, Nepal,
Britain and the United States, as well as personages from relevant
international conservationist organizations.
</P>
<P>
They were here to attend a three-day seminar on conservation
and control of the trade of Tibetan antelope which closed today.
</P>
<P>
The animal lives in the remote Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
southwest China. Poachers hunted the animal for its fur, used to
make cashmere, which was smuggled to India and Nepal for
processing and later sold in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been sternly cracking down on
poaching and smuggling of Tibetan antelope. It has also set up
nature reserves for the animal.
</P>
<P>
India, Nepal, France, Britain and Italy have also taken
measures to combat smuggling and wipe out the black market trade
of cashmere from Tibetan antelope.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Cellared Spirits to Be Auctioned in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The world's oldest cellared
spirits -- still drinkable -- will be auctioned later this month
in Beijing, according to the China Guardian Auctions Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago archeologists discovered the yellowish alcohol,
dating back 154 years, sealed in four wooden containers at an
ancient bodega in northeast China. It was later determined to be a
tribute to the imperial family of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The London-based Guinness Book of World Records confirmed it as
the "oldest cellared alcoholic tribute" in the world on July, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists, who also unearthed liquor-making equipment
at the same site, described the smell of the ancient drink as "
pleasantly fragrant." They believed the airtight wooden containers
and constant temperature helped preserve the drink.
</P>
<P>
State authoritative tests on food and beverage showed that the
liquor meets the state standards for safe drinking.
</P>
<P>
Guardian, China's biggest auctioneer, will separate 100 kg of
the spirits into 50 lots for auction.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Calls for Burden-Sharing Mechanism to Keep Malacca &AMP; Singapore Straits Clean, Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has called for the
establishment of a burden-sharing mechanism to keep the Malacca
and Singapore Straits clean and safe, taking a position that both
the coastal states and users of the straits should shoulder the
responsibility for providing maritime infrastructure for
navigational safety and for protecting the maritime environment in
the straits.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Communications and Information
Technology Yeo Cheow Tong made the point Thursday when he gave an
opening address at the two-day International Conference on the
Malacca and Singapore Straits, which is organized by the Institute
of Policy Studies (IPS) of Singapore and the International
Maritime Organization (IMO).
</P>
<P>
Yeo said it is inequitable for the coastal states to be
responsible for shouldering the responsibility to keep the straits
clean and safe.
</P>
<P>
Affirming that Singapore supports international cooperation in
the maintenance of the straits, Yeo said it will be useful to
develop an international agreed framework to share burdens in
maintenance of the straits and improvement of their infrastructure
to increase their capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Yeo made clear that his country is prepared to contribute a
fair share to a funding mechanism for the straits if there is an
international agreement to establish one.
</P>
<P>
However, the mechanism must not impede the passage of ships
through the straits, Yeo underlined.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, IMO Secretary-General William O'Neil told the
conference that he is concerned about the safety situation in the
Malacca and Singapore Straits, both of which he said are very busy
international waterways.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is possible to improve safety -- but only if we
consider the possibilities offered by the technology now available
and change some of the attitudes that still linger on from the
past."
</P>
<P>
"The most important is that one of the oldest traditions of the
sea -- that the authority of the ship's master should be paramount
-- may no longer be valid in a world that is becoming dominated by
new technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for firmer establishment of the concept that ships on
the high seas and outside territorial waters have an obligation to
obey rules imposed by international agreement.
</P>
<P>
On factors to be considered regarding positive vessel control,
O'Neil said the issue -- whether the coastal states or the ships
which use the system will pay the cost of the positive vessel
control-- must be discussed and properly addressed.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the need to address the liability issues if
something were to go wrong.
</P>
<P>
The conference is a follow-up of the first IPS/IMO conference
on the Malacca and Singapore Straits held in 1996 on the theme
"Navigational Safety and Control of Pollution in the Straits of
Malacca and Singapore: Modalities of International Cooperation."
</P>
<P>
More than 140 delegates from different parts of the world
attended the conference.

<HEADLINE> Chevron's Daily Oil Output in Angola to Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chevron, a leading petroleum
company in the world, announced here Thursday that its daily oil
production in Angola is expected to increase by 100,000 barrels
from November.
</P>
<P>

barrels per day, twice higher against 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the growth of the production will be
realized with the start of exploration in November in Block 14,
one piece of the offshore oil fields.
</P>
<P>
Derr noted that his company has another project in Block 14, a
piece of offshore oil field near Angola's central-west Province of
Benguela, which will help the company promote the oil production
in Angola.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Israeli Agricultural Cooperation Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China could introduce overseas
advanced agricultural technology in an all-round way in some of
its provinces and regions, as a good way to accelerate the country
's agricultural upgrading.
</P>
<P>
This is a view shared by Chinese and overseas experts attending
the ongoing International Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and
Vegetable Processing Technology and Industrialization, which
opened on October 12 in the coastal city of Yantai in eastern
Shandong Province and will run through October 16.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is cited as an ideal choice for agricultural
cooperation with Israel, thanks to their similar climates.
</P>
<P>
Xuan Zengpei, an official of Chinese Academy of Engineering,
said that the popularization of greenhouses used for growing
vegetables in Shandong has set a good foundation for the province
to widely introduce irrigation technology and fine seeds from
Israel to further develop local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Located in an arid area, Israel is renowned for advanced
irrigation technologies, which carry weight in agricultural
development in the country and have helped quadruple its
agricultural output on the whole, said Nathan Shunari,
agricultural attache of the Israeli Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed Israel's efficient agriculture to high-level
industrialization. Israel's investment in the development of
agricultural technology accounts for 30 percent of the country's
GNP.
</P>
<P>
China is now in great need of fostering farm products
processing companies and furthering agricultural technological
improvement, said Xuan Zengpei, adding that China should increase
economic and technological exchanges as well as cooperation with
foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Boeing 100-Seat Jets Arouse Interest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 717-200 regional jet, a
new member of the Boeing plane family, today ended its four-day
showcase tour in China after a number of Chinese air companies
announced their intention to buy the aircraft for their fleets.
</P>
<P>
The 100-seat plane, designed for short-distance passenger
flights, has been the star attraction in seven air shows in
Beijing, Wuhan, Kunming and Xiamen since last Sunday, when the jet
arrived in Beijing from the United States.
</P>
<P>
A dozen Chinese airlines, including Wuhan, Yunnan, Shenzhen and
Xiamen air companies, have shown interest in the regional jets and
three of them have expressed their intent to purchase.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the jet successfully took off at Tianhe
International Airport in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, despite rain and visibility of less than 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
"We will buy five such planes," Cheng Yaokun, general manager
of Wuhan Air Company, told Ray Bracy, President of Boeing China
Inc.
</P>
<P>
"The regional jet costs less to fly, produces little noise, and
demonstrates fine safety performance. It will suit our company
that operates a great number of regional air services," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province where
air service is brisk, Duan Shenghu, flight engineer-in-chief with
Yunnan Air Company, attended two air shows featuring the jet in
one day.
</P>
<P>
"I have been responsible for purchase of regional planes for 15
years and I found the new Boeing regional jet has demonstrated
good capabilities and is well equipped," Duan said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, all 21 planes of his company are from the
Boeing airplane family. But the company is still short of planes
suited to short-distance flights within Yunnan Province, a
mountainous region which abounds in tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
Regional planes are those that have flight distance ranging
from 500 km to 1,500 km and have about 100 seats each.
</P>
<P>
In the next two decades, the world will need 2,600 planes each
with seats ranging from 80 to 120, but the need for big planes
like the Boeing 747 only stands at 930, according to specialists.
Therefore, developing regional planes featuring good capabilities
and low operation costs will become an important field where the
world's plane manufacturers will compete fiercely.
</P>
<P>
Research on Boeing 717-200 passenger planes started in 1995.
The first such aircraft was delivered in September this year. Air
companies from the United States and Europe have placed orders for
128 Boeing 717-200 planes, sources said.

<P>
QINGDAO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The 21st Meeting of the China/
World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Coordination Committee (JCC)
opened Wednesday in this coastal city in east China's Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the last one in this century, will audit the
implementation of the 1998-1999 program and discuss new
cooperation projects in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
There will be an introduction to the making of China's public
health plan for the 2001-2005 period and to the four major areas
of cooperation between the WHO and China. Namely, the prevention
and treatment of tuberculosis, the reform of public health
services, the control of tobacco, and the health of the aged.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Speed Up Research on Electric Vehicle: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Prof. Lun Jingguang from
Qinghua University said that China should speed up its research on
electric vehicles to protect the country's environment and promote
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
Lun was speaking at the 16th International Electric Vehicle
Symposium, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Lun pointed out that electric vehicles produce no exhaust
emission -- one culprit responsible for China's worsening air
quality.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surplus electricity generated in the evening can be
used for battery charging for electric vehicles, said Lun.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China generated 270 million kwh of electricity, 60
million of which were surplus and can be used for battery charging
for 12 million electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Lun noted that the research on hybrid vehicles and fuel cell
vehicles is now a trend, adding that the hybrid vehicle, with its
advantages of having both an internal-combustion engine and
batteries, will have a larger market in China in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the Toyota Motor Corporation has sold 30,000 hybrid
vehicles. Other major auto makers, such as General Motors, are
also doing research on them.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cooperatives Erasing Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The supply and marketing
cooperatives (SMC) in China erased 370 million yuan in deficits in
the first eight months this year, basically holding the money-
losing trend in check.
</P>
<P>
SMC is a non-governmental farmers' organization. It is also a
key channel of commodity purchase and sales in China's rural areas.
It was born out of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the transition from a planned economy to a market-
orientated economy, the problems of cooperatives such as staff
redundancy, low-efficiency and lack of competitiveness have become
increasingly apparent.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued a circular early this year urging an
immediate system reform to reverse the loss-making trend of
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives,
the administrative body of grassroots cooperatives, has enhanced
efforts in reshaping money-losing enterprises by adopting the
shareholding system, acquisition and merger.
</P>
<P>
Li Dianhui, who is with the organization and attending the
fifth Asia-Pacific Cooperative Ministers' Conference being held in
Beijing, said that cooperatives are striving to make profits, and
"at least not to lose money in operation this year."
</P>
<P>
Although the downward trend is not reversed, the number of
money-losing enterprises were reduced by a large margin, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has a total of 30,000 cooperatives at all levels, with
cooperative members exceeding 180 million.

<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- No spread of disease has been
found in Taiwan's earthquake-hit areas, according to the latest
message sent to the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) by the
Taiwan Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
In response to a letter from the RCSC, the Taiwan Red Cross
said in a letter dated October 12 that disaster relief materials
have been supplied in those areas to date.
</P>
<P>
Gu Yingqi, vice-president of the RCSC, wrote to the Taiwan Red
Cross on October 11, saying that his organization has again sent
200,000 U.S. dollars in relief funds to the Taiwan Red Cross and
has prepared relief materials and formed a medical team ready to
join in relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Red Cross said in its letter that it "appreciates
very much" the RCSC's donation of relief funds and "extends best
regards" to the RCSC.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Red Cross also said that it does not need any relief
materials and medical aid at present, and it will continue to
evaluate its needs in the future.

<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Health and

improve public health and curative services, as well as promote
healthy living by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The target was announced by Secretary for Health and Welfare, E

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China to Levy Tax on Bank Account Interest in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China will begin to levy tax on
the interest of savings accounts on November 1, the government
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The 20-percent tax will be levied on the interest of all
Renminbi and foreign currency savings accounts that an individual
person opened in banks in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the interest that the savings accounts generated
before November 1 will be exempt.
</P>
<P>
The State Council announced here today that the government will
not levy tax on savings accounts exclusively for educational
purposes and other special savings accounts and funds that the
finance authorities has designated.
</P>
<P>
In August, the Chinese government activated the long-inactive
clause on interest tax in the Law on Individual Income Tax in a
move to stimulate consumption by residents.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Finance said that the new tax is
like an interest rate cut by one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The government believes that imposing the interest tax will
help take from the rich to pay the poor because about ten percent
of the population own 50 percent of the total savings deposits in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Finance, the tax money will be
used to raise economic assistance for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China's total savings deposits soared to 5,
910 billion yuan, compared to 1,520 billion yuan at the end of
1993.
</P>
<P>
However, China's retail prices have been falling for more than
20 consecutive months as economists rang alarms for deflation.

<HEADLINE> HK Land Sale Attracts Lukewarm Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Lands
Department sold two government lots for a total of 706 million HK
dollars (90.5 million US dollars) at a public auction Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's biggest property developer, Cheung Kong (Holdings)
Ltd., won the bid for a 14,435 square meter site in rural Tin Shui
Wai for 555 million HK dollars (71.15 million U.S. dollars),
slightly higher than the opening price of 500 million (64.1
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The smaller lot of 2,267 square meters in the luxury
residential area of Repulse Bay attracted keen bidding with the
government offering it for 120 million HK dollars (15.38 million U.
S. dollars). It was sold to Fu Hop International Investment Co.
Ltd., a registered shell company, for 151 million HK dollars (19.
23 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected the two sites put on sale by the
government to raise around one billion HK dollars (128.2 million U.
S. dollars), and the outcome indicated that a recovery in the
property market still had some way to go.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the land developers are cautious but active
as the land auction was seen as a key test for the health of the
property sector, one of the mainstays of the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
But over the past six months property prices have edged upwards
by about 10-15 percent, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth land auction by the HK government. On April
20, the government's first land sale in nine months raised almost
1.5 billion dollars (192.3 million U.S. dollars), beating market
projections of 1.2 billion dollars (153.8 million U.S. dollars)
for three residential plots on offer.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended its land sales program at the end of
June last year in a bid to shore up sagging property prices that
had been hit hard by the Asian financial crisis.

Colonel General Yuri Zalogin, the Russian liaison troops chief,

Kosovo, where Russian troops are serving peacekeeping missions.

Zalogin claimed that some communication satellites having a

UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday voiced his regret at the U.S. Senate's vote

</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued here by his spokesman, said that
he "has learned with regret of the negative vote of the Senate of

Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty."
</P>
<P>
"Both as Secretary-General of the United Nations, and in his
capacity as Depositary of the Treaty, he has consistently appealed
to Member States who have not done so to sign and ratify the
Treaty in order that this important norm against nuclear
proliferation and the further development of nuclear weapons
should enter into force and become part of international law," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Participants in the Conference for Facilitating the Entry into
Force of the CTBT issued a Declaration in Vienna on October 8
reaffirming the importance of a universal and internationally and
effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General reaffirms this goal in view of its
importance in maintaining the nuclear non-proliferation regime and
progress towards nuclear disarmament," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Ratification of the CTBT failed in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday
by a vote of 48 to 51 with one abstention. The Senate's Republican
majority overwhelmingly opposed the pact.
</P>
<P>
The treaty is aimed at curbing the spread of nuclear weapons
but cannot go into force unless 44 nuclear-capable countries,
including the United States, ratify it.

The vote brought about grave concerns and even disappointment
from all over the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The national capital launched
the third stage of its anti-air-pollution campaign today by
proposing a set of 22 measures to reduce the volume of air
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has implemented a set of 46 measures to take air
pollution under control since late 1998, according to Zhao Yixin,
director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhao told the press today that Beijing has made progress in
controlling air pollution thanks to effective measures to curb
local air pollution caused by coal burning, auto exhaust emissions,
and dust and suspended dirt particles.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sulfur dioxide density in the air in the past
nine months of this year fell an average of 25 percent from the
same period last year. The amount of nitride and oxide in Beijing'
s air remained at the same level as last year, even though the
city's number of automobiles has been increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The new measures will focus on the control of coal-burning and
auto-exhaust emissions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial firms are all required to meet the city's
standards in environmental protection before the end of the year
2000, or they will be shut down, Zhao said.

The delegation led by Justice Mark Bomani of Tanzania called on
Museveni to brief him on the progress of the Arusha Peace Talks
aimed at bringing peace in Burundi, according to a press release
issued here by the President' s Office.
</P>
<P>
The delegation came to consult Museveni before the Burundian
factions resume their talks in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha
next Monday, considering that the peace process, initiated by
regional leaders, is now in its last stage.
</P>
<P>
The delegates have already held talks with Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi on the same issues and they are proceeding to
Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi.

It was not clear whether Thursday's death of former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere, the chief mediator in the Burundi peace
process, has any major negative impact on the forthcoming peace
talks.

<P>
The situation in Burundi is still volatile and cases of
inter-ethnic killings are occassionally reported in the country.

<HEADLINE> CCT Telecom to Continue Invest in China's Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The investment environment in
China's mainland is becoming better and better, according to
Clement Mak, chairman of CCT Telecom Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong-
based integrated information technology services provider.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom will continue to invest on telecom projects in the
mainland as the company's business there has enjoyed a smooth
development in the past years, Flora Cheng, executive director of
the company, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom, originally a manufacturer of telecom products and
electronic and plastic components, started its telecom networks
business in 1997 by cooperating with China Unicom in investing on
GSM networks in northern China's Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Later on, the company took part in China Unicom's GSM networks
project in Shanghai, the biggest city in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, CCT Telecom has invested more than 500 million HK
dollars (64 million U.S. dollars) in the GSM networks in China's
mainland and the company has begun to make profits from the
investment.
</P>
<P>
The company now has several factories on the mainland to
manufacture dual and trio band mobile phones and other telecom
products.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1998, CCT Telecom began entering Hong Kong'
s Internet market by buying HK Net. Eight months later, HK Net
ranked 2nd in the share of Internet market in Hong Kong with 160,
000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
HK Net is a provider of diversified Internet services including
ISP, IDD, Portal/ICP, E-Commerce, VPN, Security, System
integration, Web hosting and co-location and Web design.
</P>
<P>
HK Net has been recently elected the 4th Internet company in
Asia by Telecom Asia Magazine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Japan's NTT Communication Corporation bought
49 percent of the shares of HK Net, becoming a strategic partner
of HK Net.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom is planning to list HK Net on the NASDAQ stock
exchange of the United States at the beginning of next year and
the company is now applying for the fixed wireless license and the
external gateway license from the government.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom is making efforts to become a global telecom
operator in the future, Mak said.

<HEADLINE> Nations Issue Antelope Conservation Declaration in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The international community took
the first bold step forward here today to coordinate efforts in
the fight against rampant poaching and smuggling of Tibetan
antelope, one of the world's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Seven countries jointly issued the Xining Declaration on the
Conservation and Control of Trade in Tibetan Antelope in this
capital city of northwest China's Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
The declaration describes in detail the responsibilities of the
countries concerned in protecting the endangered species and
controlling the trade of products made from the animal.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the governments of the countries to support this
move by providing necessary funds, technology and material aid. It
also urges the countries that process and sell cashmere products
to increase publicity about the conservation of Tibetan antelope.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was jointly issued by more than 80
representatives from government organs, non-government
organizations and experts from China, France, India, Italy, Nepal,
Britain and the United States, as well as personages from relevant
international conservationist organizations.
</P>
<P>
They were here to attend a three-day seminar on conservation
and control of the trade of Tibetan antelope which closed today.
</P>
<P>
The animal lives in the remote Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
southwest China. Poachers hunted the animal for its fur, used to
make cashmere, which was smuggled to India and Nepal for
processing and later sold in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been sternly cracking down on
poaching and smuggling of Tibetan antelope. It has also set up
nature reserves for the animal.
</P>
<P>
India, Nepal, France, Britain and Italy have also taken
measures to combat smuggling and wipe out the black market trade
of cashmere from Tibetan antelope.

<HEADLINE> China Scores Breakthrough in Study of Mammal Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved a
breakthrough in the study of the origin of mammals with the
discovery of a large number of fossilized mammal bones dating back
some 100 million years in northeastern China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The fossils, including teeth, jawbones, vertebra and limbs,
belonged to a kind of small animal living in the Mesozoic Period,
said Zhang Pulin, who discovered these fossils along a 80-meter-
long and 50-meter-wide stratum in summer.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that it is quite rare to find mammal bones of the
Mesozoic Period, when the dinosaur dominated the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the discovery will provide valuable
materials for the study of mammal origins, which will be the
hottest topic among the world's archeological in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Similar Mesozoic fossils have also been discovered in the
western region of Liaoning Province, also in northeastern China,
where Sinornithosaurus, believed to be the ancestor of birds, were
unearthed. But local archeologists believe these belonged to a
different family.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization Way Forward For China's Rural Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China should upgrade its rural
economy by promoting the industrialization of agriculture,
according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
"The industrialization of agriculture must be the way forward
for China's rural economy," said Song Jian, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, China's highest advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Song, also president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
made the remarks at the ongoing International Symposium and
Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing Technology and
Industrialization, sponsored by the Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific of the United Nations and several other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in rural China as a result of
the reform and opening-up drive, Song said, but the country has
just begun efforts to industrialize and modernize agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China's rural economy has been facing a series of problems,
including inadequate intensive production and mechanized
operations, according to Song.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Song said, China grows hundreds of millions of
tons of vegetables and 9.5 million tons of fruit annually, but
these huge harvests are mainly brought about by traditional
methods which are technically backward and consume too many
resources.
</P>
<P>
Song said one of the major tasks facing Chinese science and
technology in the coming century is the all-out promotion of
agricultural industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts will be taken to develop high-tech farm produce
and processing machinery in a bid to accelerate this process and
increase the value of agricultural products, Song said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing symposium and exhibition will have a positive
effect on the modernization of China's rural economy, Song said.

<HEADLINE> Natural Habitats Crucial for Siberian Tiger Protection: Zoologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We need to intensify international cooperation, set up natural
reserves, and ensure a smooth communication channel for the wild
Siberian tigers, so as to save the species from extinction," said
Dr. Dale G. Miquelle, Field Coordinator of the Siberian Tiger
Project under the WCS.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists point out that excessive hunting, de-afforestation
and the fast spread of housing areas have caused the rapid
decrease in the Siberian tiger population.
</P>
<P>
"In the past two decades, its number has decreased from over 80
to some twenty to thirty in the early 1990s," said Guan Guosheng
with the Heilongjiang WRI.
</P>
<P>
Some natural living areas suitable for the tigers still exist,
said Dr.Zhang Endi, in charge of the Asia Conservation
Communication Program. And the Central Government's efforts in
natural forest protection, together with the fact that there
remain over 300 Siberian tigers in the Russian border area, make
the protection possible.
</P>
<P>
Setting up a Sino-Russian natural reserve and an efficient
control network, and issuing related regulations will benefit the
protection, Dr. Miquelle said.
</P>
<P>
The investigation by the Wildlife Conservation Society, the
Hornocker Wildlife Research Institute, and the Heilongjiang
Wildlife Research Institute (WRI) in the province starting from
1998 reveals that now only between nine and 13 Siberian tigers
live in the forests of Wandashan Mountain, Laoye Mountain, and the
Changbai Mountains.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Israeli Agricultural Cooperation Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China could introduce overseas
advanced agricultural technology in an all-round way in some of
its provinces and regions, as a good way to accelerate the country
's agricultural upgrading.
</P>
<P>
This is a view shared by Chinese and overseas experts attending
the ongoing International Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and
Vegetable Processing Technology and Industrialization, which
opened on October 12 in the coastal city of Yantai in eastern
Shandong Province and will run through October 16.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is cited as an ideal choice for agricultural
cooperation with Israel, thanks to their similar climates.
</P>
<P>
Xuan Zengpei, an official of Chinese Academy of Engineering,
said that the popularization of greenhouses used for growing
vegetables in Shandong has set a good foundation for the province
to widely introduce irrigation technology and fine seeds from
Israel to further develop local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Located in an arid area, Israel is renowned for advanced
irrigation technologies, which carry weight in agricultural
development in the country and have helped quadruple its
agricultural output on the whole, said Nathan Shunari,
agricultural attache of the Israeli Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed Israel's efficient agriculture to high-level
industrialization. Israel's investment in the development of
agricultural technology accounts for 30 percent of the country's
GNP.
</P>
<P>
China is now in great need of fostering farm products
processing companies and furthering agricultural technological
improvement, said Xuan Zengpei, adding that China should increase
economic and technological exchanges as well as cooperation with
foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Southernmost Chinese Province Plans AIDS-Control Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- In order to prevent the spread
of AIDS, the island province of Hainan in southernmost China has a
plan to stop the virus from being transmitted through blood
donation channels, a major cause of AIDS infection on the island.
</P>
<P>
The plan underscores the importance of popularizing AIDS
education and knowledge about the ways sexually transmitted
diseases can be combated to the rural population. Related topics
will also be included in school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Next year, five to six monitoring centers will be set up
offering regular examinations for venereal disease carriers, drug
addicts, and blood donator.
</P>
<P>
The province will also establish advanced AIDS consultations
and treatment and service centers as well as specialized medical
teams. The monitoring and instruction about the disease will be
given to communities who will be urged to set up an AIDS-control
network.
</P>
<P>
Hainan detected the first case of AIDS in 1991. Since then, 29
out of 140,000 people who received blood tests were found HIV
positive, and six of them died of AIDS. Experts believe that the
number of people in the province now contaminated has reached more
than 300.

<HEADLINE> Boeing 100-Seat Jets Arouse Interest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 717-200 regional jet, a
new member of the Boeing plane family, today ended its four-day
showcase tour in China after a number of Chinese air companies
announced their intention to buy the aircraft for their fleets.
</P>
<P>
The 100-seat plane, designed for short-distance passenger
flights, has been the star attraction in seven air shows in
Beijing, Wuhan, Kunming and Xiamen since last Sunday, when the jet
arrived in Beijing from the United States.
</P>
<P>
A dozen Chinese airlines, including Wuhan, Yunnan, Shenzhen and
Xiamen air companies, have shown interest in the regional jets and
three of them have expressed their intent to purchase.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the jet successfully took off at Tianhe
International Airport in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, despite rain and visibility of less than 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
"We will buy five such planes," Cheng Yaokun, general manager
of Wuhan Air Company, told Ray Bracy, President of Boeing China
Inc.
</P>
<P>
"The regional jet costs less to fly, produces little noise, and
demonstrates fine safety performance. It will suit our company
that operates a great number of regional air services," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province where
air service is brisk, Duan Shenghu, flight engineer-in-chief with
Yunnan Air Company, attended two air shows featuring the jet in
one day.
</P>
<P>
"I have been responsible for purchase of regional planes for 15
years and I found the new Boeing regional jet has demonstrated
good capabilities and is well equipped," Duan said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, all 21 planes of his company are from the
Boeing airplane family. But the company is still short of planes
suited to short-distance flights within Yunnan Province, a
mountainous region which abounds in tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
Regional planes are those that have flight distance ranging
from 500 km to 1,500 km and have about 100 seats each.
</P>
<P>
In the next two decades, the world will need 2,600 planes each
with seats ranging from 80 to 120, but the need for big planes
like the Boeing 747 only stands at 930, according to specialists.
Therefore, developing regional planes featuring good capabilities
and low operation costs will become an important field where the
world's plane manufacturers will compete fiercely.
</P>
<P>
Research on Boeing 717-200 passenger planes started in 1995.
The first such aircraft was delivered in September this year. Air
companies from the United States and Europe have placed orders for
128 Boeing 717-200 planes, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Syrian FM Returns Home After Surgery in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Sharaa returned home Thursday after recovering from a
successful heart surgery in neighboring Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Before quitting the Beirut's American University Hospital
(AUH), al-Sharaa issued a statement expressing his thanks to those
who have shown deep concern and care about his health, including
Lebanese president, prime minister and house speaker.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, suffering from aortic dissection, was first admitted
to a private hospital in Damascus on October 3 with chest pains
during a reception for Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.
</P>
<P>
After diagnosed, he decided to have an operation in the famous
AUH.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a team of seven doctors conducted the surgery which
was announced to be very successful.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Beirut, Lebanese ministers, deputies and
celebrities flocked to the hospital to express their concern and
well wishes.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is stationing a 350,000-member troop in Lebanon,
is a undisputed power broker in the country.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sharaa, 59, has been foreign minister since 1984. He was
also a key figure in shaping Syria's foregin policy under
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
His sudden illness sparked widespread concern for the current
peace process, which is widely anticipated to restart after
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak came to power in July.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was among the first to wish al-Sharaa a speedy
recovery, warying that the Syrian minister is an integral cog in
restarting peace talks with Israel, which broke down in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We do wish him a successful treatment and a speedy recovery,"
State Department spokesman James Rubin has said.
</P>
<P>
Although the minister has left the hospital, it is unknown when
he will return to work.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Scholar Commemorated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 Chinese and
foreign scholars gathered in this capital of southwest China's
Guizhou Province today to discuss the important role an ancient
Chinese thinker may have in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
At an international seminar that opened here today, scholars
from the United States, Japan, Russia, China and the regions of
Taiwan and Hong Kong will exchange views on the study of Wang
Shouren, widely known as Wang Yangming, a famous thinker,
philosopher and educator of the Ming Dynasty ((1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Tour to the ruins of the home of this ancient scholar has also
been arranged along with trade and investment promotion activities.
</P>
<P>
Wang was banished to Guizhou from the then capital city of
Nanjing, where he served as a senior official, for displeasing an
influential eunuch by speaking out from a sense of justice. While
staying in Guizhou, he trained many people by giving lectures
everywhere and cultivated a unique philosophical system.
</P>
<P>
His idea of stressing the unity of individual, society, nature
and heavenly laws can be equated to Western cultural values such
as equality and liberty, and his thinking has held an important
position not only in China for hundreds of years, but has also
influenced people in Japan and Korea, said one participant.

<HEADLINE> China Needs to Improve Freshness-Preservation Technology: Russian Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China needs to strengthen the
development and application of fruit and vegetable freshness-
preservation technology to ensure product quality and sharpen the
competitive edge in the global market, a renowned Russian
horticulture expert said today.
</P>
<P>
"Fresh-keeping facilities are essential to ensure that fruit
and vegetables retain their taste. This is the main appeal for
global customers," said Gudkovskl Vladimir Alexandrovich, director
of the I.V.Michurin All-Russian Research Institute of Horticulture,
one of the world's leading academic institution on horticulture
development.
</P>
<P>
The professor was airing his view at a workshop on agriculture
technology and know-how in Yantai, a port city in east China's
Shandong Province. The seminar was part of the International
Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing
Technology and Industrialization, the first ever held in China,
which is runs through October 16.
</P>
<P>
The lack of advanced technology for keeping fruit and
vegetables fresh has long plagued the growth of the fruit and
vegetable processing industry in many developing countries in Asia,
including China, and has ruined 50 to 60 percent of their harvest
every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's largest fruit and vegetable
producers, with an annual production of hundreds of millions of
tons, but much of this is ruined every year due to poor fresh-
keeping facilities and technology.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that Russian research institutions and high-
tech enterprises are willing to come to China's aid with advanced
technology and facilities, and that exchange and cooperation in
this regard between the two countries is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Russia has developed freshness preservation and storing
technology for a variety of fruits. For example, it boasts a newly
developed storehouse equipped with advanced air-conditioning and
control systems which sharply reduce the amount of oxygen. Under
these conditions, apples can retain their look, taste, and
freshness up to 10 months after they are picked.
</P>
<P>
"I hope there will be more channels for technology talent of
both countries to cooperate in order to contribute to the
development of more advanced agricultural know-how," he said.

<HEADLINE> Patriotic Song Warmly Greeted in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The song entitled "Five Star
National Flag" presented during the evening gala celebrating the
50th anniversary of the founding of New China was warmly received
by the Chinese and caused a great stir nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The patriotic song, composed specially for the 50th anniversary,
has been turned into a MTV program featuring a variety of flag-
raising scenes, by the Beijing Television Station.
</P>
<P>
Although the song has a political theme, it has gained great
popularity among the Chinese because of its beautiful melody,
inspiring lyrics, and the patriotism the five star national flag
stands for in the hearts of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The five star national flag represents the past tribulations of
the Chinese people, their pleasure in victory, and their great
expectations for the future, according to the song's composer,
Tian Ming.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the song will bring everyone together, by inspiring
patriotism and idea of national cohesion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yongfeng, a renowned Chinese mountain climber, said he
felt his heart quake when he heard the song. "The song is so
inspiring to me because the five star national flag is a sacred
symbol to every alpinist," he said. "During the final sprint
toward the summit, a climber may abandon camera, food, clothing,
and even oxygen, but the flag is something indispensable and we
must plant it on the summit we have conquered."

<HEADLINE> China's Listed Township Enterprises Report Higher Profits than Nation's Average (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Interim reports of the 29
township enterprises listed on China's Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges indicate that their profits for the first six months of
the year outgrew the average for all domestic listed companies.
</P>
<P>
From January to June this year, these township enterprises
gained an income of 12.7 billion yuan from their main business
operations, up 51.9 percent from the same period last year, and 39.
43 percent higher than the national average for all listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
Their net profits hit 1.612 billion yuan, up 22.49 percent, and
17.65 percentage points higher than the average.
</P>
<P>
The reports also show that the listed township enterprises
further increased their money-making ability. In the first half
year, the average profits of these enterprises reached 55.5
million yuan, with the average ratio of assets and liabilities
standing at 38 percent. Six of them also have surpassed ten
percent in net-asset-return ratio.
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly 40 township enterprises have been listed
domestically since 1993 when the first township enterprise,
Guangdong Yuemeidi Electric Appliance A shares, was listed in
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
And some township enterprises has began to offer on overseas
stock exchanges. For example, the Guangdong Kelong Electric
Appliance has been listed in Hong Kong, and a porcelain company in
Guangdong Province is soon to be listed in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Township Enterprise Bureau under the
Ministry of Agriculture said that the listed township enterprises,
which lead in assets and profits in their respective domestic
sectors, are playing an exemplary role for other township
enterprises nationwide in their reform and development.

<HEADLINE> China's Listed Township Enterprises Report Higher Profits than Nation's Average (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But despite their superb economic performance, township
enterprises still face many obstacles in their attempts to become
listed, and the total number of listed township enterprises
account for only about 4 percent on the domestic stock market.
</P>
<P>
"This is not conducive to township enterprises reform, nor to
their competition with state-owned enterprises on an equal footing,
" he said, noting that such a small percentage of listed
enterprises does not jibe with the status of township enterprises
in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, and especially since late 1970s,
township enterprises have witnessed remarkable development and now
constitute the main part of the rural economy, representing almost
half of the country's industrial sector and a pillar of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics indicates that in 1998,
rural businesses realized an added output value of 2.2186 trillion
yuan, making up 27.9 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, these businesses contributed one-fifth of
all national tax revenues and 34.8 percent of the country's total
exports.
</P>
<P>
China's township enterprises have maintained a momentum of
steady growth so far this year. From January to August, they
reported a total output value added of 1.6213 trillion yuan, up 16.
8 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
 The official called for more attention to be paid to the
importance of listing township enterprises and more support in
this regard.

<HEADLINE> Speed Up Research on Electric Vehicle: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Prof. Lun Jingguang from
Qinghua University said that China should speed up its research on
electric vehicles to protect the country's environment and promote
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
Lun was speaking at the 16th International Electric Vehicle
Symposium, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Lun pointed out that electric vehicles produce no exhaust
emission -- one culprit responsible for China's worsening air
quality.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surplus electricity generated in the evening can be
used for battery charging for electric vehicles, said Lun.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China generated 270 million kwh of electricity, 60
million of which were surplus and can be used for battery charging
for 12 million electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Lun noted that the research on hybrid vehicles and fuel cell
vehicles is now a trend, adding that the hybrid vehicle, with its
advantages of having both an internal-combustion engine and
batteries, will have a larger market in China in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the Toyota Motor Corporation has sold 30,000 hybrid
vehicles. Other major auto makers, such as General Motors, are
also doing research on them.

<HEADLINE> FedEx to Open New Cargo Flight Between China, US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua)-- The U.S.-based Federal Express (
FedEx) corporation will open a new air-cargo route next month
between the United States and Shenzhen in south China.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Representative Office of FedEx, there
will be five flights a week on the new route using DC-10 and MD-11
aircraft, based on an agreement signed by FedEx and the Shenzhen
Airport.
</P>
<P>
"As an important gateway to southern China, Shenzhen is an
integral part of our express transport networks in China, the Asia-
Pacific region and in the world," said Michael Ducker, president
of FedEx Asia Pacific Division, adding that the new service will
benefit both exporters and importers.
</P>
<P>
FedEx began service from the United States to Beijing and
Shanghai in 1996 as the only foreign air freight company with the
right to fly its own aircraft to and from China.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Airport expects to enhance its position as a major
air-cargo center in south China and a significant international
trans-shipment center in the region with the new service, said Lu
Shenhai, president of Shenzhen Airport Co.
</P>
<P>
The airport is capable of handling up to 250,000 tons of cargo
annually, and is equipped with the most advanced container-cargo
processing system in China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cooperatives Erasing Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The supply and marketing
cooperatives (SMC) in China erased 370 million yuan in deficits in
the first eight months this year, basically holding the money-
losing trend in check.
</P>
<P>
SMC is a non-governmental farmers' organization. It is also a
key channel of commodity purchase and sales in China's rural areas.
It was born out of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the transition from a planned economy to a market-
orientated economy, the problems of cooperatives such as staff
redundancy, low-efficiency and lack of competitiveness have become
increasingly apparent.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued a circular early this year urging an
immediate system reform to reverse the loss-making trend of
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives,
the administrative body of grassroots cooperatives, has enhanced
efforts in reshaping money-losing enterprises by adopting the
shareholding system, acquisition and merger.
</P>
<P>
Li Dianhui, who is with the organization and attending the
fifth Asia-Pacific Cooperative Ministers' Conference being held in
Beijing, said that cooperatives are striving to make profits, and
"at least not to lose money in operation this year."
</P>
<P>
Although the downward trend is not reversed, the number of
money-losing enterprises were reduced by a large margin, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has a total of 30,000 cooperatives at all levels, with
cooperative members exceeding 180 million.

<HEADLINE> China to Levy Tax on Bank Account Interest in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China will begin to levy tax on
the interest of savings accounts on November 1, the government
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The 20-percent tax will be levied on the interest of all
Renminbi and foreign currency savings accounts that an individual
person opened in banks in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the interest that the savings accounts generated
before November 1 will be exempt.
</P>
<P>
The State Council announced here today that the government will
not levy tax on savings accounts exclusively for educational
purposes and other special savings accounts and funds that the
finance authorities has designated.
</P>
<P>
In August, the Chinese government activated the long-inactive
clause on interest tax in the Law on Individual Income Tax in a
move to stimulate consumption by residents.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Finance said that the new tax is
like an interest rate cut by one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The government believes that imposing the interest tax will
help take from the rich to pay the poor because about ten percent
of the population own 50 percent of the total savings deposits in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Finance, the tax money will be
used to raise economic assistance for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China's total savings deposits soared to 5,
910 billion yuan, compared to 1,520 billion yuan at the end of
1993.
</P>
<P>
However, China's retail prices have been falling for more than
20 consecutive months as economists rang alarms for deflation.

<HEADLINE> HK Land Sale Attracts Lukewarm Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Lands
Department sold two government lots for a total of 706 million HK
dollars (90.5 million US dollars) at a public auction Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's biggest property developer, Cheung Kong (Holdings)
Ltd., won the bid for a 14,435 square meter site in rural Tin Shui
Wai for 555 million HK dollars (71.15 million U.S. dollars),
slightly higher than the opening price of 500 million (64.1
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The smaller lot of 2,267 square meters in the luxury
residential area of Repulse Bay attracted keen bidding with the
government offering it for 120 million HK dollars (15.38 million U.
S. dollars). It was sold to Fu Hop International Investment Co.
Ltd., a registered shell company, for 151 million HK dollars (19.
23 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected the two sites put on sale by the
government to raise around one billion HK dollars (128.2 million U.
S. dollars), and the outcome indicated that a recovery in the
property market still had some way to go.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the land developers are cautious but active
as the land auction was seen as a key test for the health of the
property sector, one of the mainstays of the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
But over the past six months property prices have edged upwards
by about 10-15 percent, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth land auction by the HK government. On April
20, the government's first land sale in nine months raised almost
1.5 billion dollars (192.3 million U.S. dollars), beating market
projections of 1.2 billion dollars (153.8 million U.S. dollars)
for three residential plots on offer.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended its land sales program at the end of
June last year in a bid to shore up sagging property prices that
had been hit hard by the Asian financial crisis.

<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- An international symposium on
fruit and vegetable processing technology and industrialization
closed here today, with countries in the Asia-Pacific region urged
to improve the processing technology they currently use for these
foods.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium was an important component of the
International Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable
Processing Technology and Industrialization, the first
international symposium on the matter ever held in China.
</P>
<P>
Scholars and experts from at home and abroad gave presentations

<HEADLINE> Annan Mourns Death of Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday voiced his "great sadness" at the death of
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, saying that he was "a
life-long friend and supporter of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Annan said in a statement, issued here, that "I heard with
great sadness last night of the death of Julius Nyerere, the
founder and first president of the United Republic of Tanzania,
and one of the architects of the Organization of African Unity."
</P>
<P>
"President Nyerere was one of the giants of the 20th century
African liberation movement," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"As a leader who brought his country to independence without
bloodshed, by uniting all the people in a single non-violent but
irresistible movement, he inspires a whole generation of Africans
struggling for freedom throughout the continent, in widely
differing countries and political contexts."
</P>
<P>
"Later he also set a fine example by renouncing power
voluntarily, and handing it on to his successor through an orderly
constitutional process," the statement said. "He fully earned the
nickname of 'Mwalimu', or 'Teacher', by which he was
affectionately known throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
"Both before and after leaving office, he gave unstintingly of
his strength and wisdom in the quest for African unity, freedom
and peace," the statement said. "Even in his last months he worked
tirelessly for a political settlement of the troubles in Burundi.
And he was a lifelong friend and supporter of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, his star shone well beyond the shores of Africa," the
statement said. "He had friends and admires all over the world. I
am proud to count myself among them, and I send my heartfelt
condolences to his family and people."
</P>
<P>
The former Tanzanian president died in a London hospital on
Thursday aged 77. He was diagnosed with chronic leukaemia last
year and admitted to St. Thomas's Hospital in London last month.
He went into intensive care on October 1, suffered a major stroke
last week and died at 0730 GMT on Thursday, when Annan, the first
black African to head the world body, is on a visit to London.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Continues Work to Control Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The national capital launched
the third stage of its anti-air-pollution campaign today by
proposing a set of 22 measures to reduce the volume of air
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has implemented a set of 46 measures to take air
pollution under control since late 1998, according to Zhao Yixin,
director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhao told the press today that Beijing has made progress in
controlling air pollution thanks to effective measures to curb
local air pollution caused by coal burning, auto exhaust emissions,
and dust and suspended dirt particles.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sulfur dioxide density in the air in the past
nine months of this year fell an average of 25 percent from the
same period last year. The amount of nitride and oxide in Beijing'
s air remained at the same level as last year, even though the
city's number of automobiles has been increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The new measures will focus on the control of coal-burning and
auto-exhaust emissions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial firms are all required to meet the city's
standards in environmental protection before the end of the year
2000, or they will be shut down, Zhao said.

<HEADLINE> CCT Telecom to Continue Invest in China's Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The investment environment in
China's mainland is becoming better and better, according to
Clement Mak, chairman of CCT Telecom Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong-
based integrated information technology services provider.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom will continue to invest on telecom projects in the
mainland as the company's business there has enjoyed a smooth
development in the past years, Flora Cheng, executive director of
the company, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom, originally a manufacturer of telecom products and
electronic and plastic components, started its telecom networks
business in 1997 by cooperating with China Unicom in investing on
GSM networks in northern China's Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Later on, the company took part in China Unicom's GSM networks
project in Shanghai, the biggest city in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, CCT Telecom has invested more than 500 million HK
dollars (64 million U.S. dollars) in the GSM networks in China's
mainland and the company has begun to make profits from the
investment.
</P>
<P>
The company now has several factories on the mainland to
manufacture dual and trio band mobile phones and other telecom
products.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1998, CCT Telecom began entering Hong Kong'
s Internet market by buying HK Net. Eight months later, HK Net
ranked 2nd in the share of Internet market in Hong Kong with 160,
000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
HK Net is a provider of diversified Internet services including
ISP, IDD, Portal/ICP, E-Commerce, VPN, Security, System
integration, Web hosting and co-location and Web design.
</P>
<P>
HK Net has been recently elected the 4th Internet company in
Asia by Telecom Asia Magazine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Japan's NTT Communication Corporation bought
49 percent of the shares of HK Net, becoming a strategic partner
of HK Net.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom is planning to list HK Net on the NASDAQ stock
exchange of the United States at the beginning of next year and
the company is now applying for the fixed wireless license and the
external gateway license from the government.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom is making efforts to become a global telecom
operator in the future, Mak said.

<HEADLINE> Nations Issue Antelope Conservation Declaration in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The international community took
the first bold step forward here today to coordinate efforts in
the fight against rampant poaching and smuggling of Tibetan
antelope, one of the world's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Seven countries jointly issued the Xining Declaration on the
Conservation and Control of Trade in Tibetan Antelope in this
capital city of northwest China's Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
The declaration describes in detail the responsibilities of the
countries concerned in protecting the endangered species and
controlling the trade of products made from the animal.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the governments of the countries to support this
move by providing necessary funds, technology and material aid. It
also urges the countries that process and sell cashmere products
to increase publicity about the conservation of Tibetan antelope.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was jointly issued by more than 80
representatives from government organs, non-government
organizations and experts from China, France, India, Italy, Nepal,
Britain and the United States, as well as personages from relevant
international conservationist organizations.
</P>
<P>
They were here to attend a three-day seminar on conservation
and control of the trade of Tibetan antelope which closed today.
</P>
<P>
The animal lives in the remote Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
southwest China. Poachers hunted the animal for its fur, used to
make cashmere, which was smuggled to India and Nepal for
processing and later sold in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been sternly cracking down on
poaching and smuggling of Tibetan antelope. It has also set up
nature reserves for the animal.
</P>
<P>
India, Nepal, France, Britain and Italy have also taken
measures to combat smuggling and wipe out the black market trade
of cashmere from Tibetan antelope.

<HEADLINE> HK Enhances Legislation Against Piracy, Counterfeiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
announced Thursday that copyright piracy and trade mark
counterfeiting offenses would be added into the Organized and
Serious Crises Ordinance (OSCO), subject to the approval of the
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The offenses to be included are related to the making or
dealing with infringing copies of copyright works under the
Copyright Ordinance and infringement of trade mark rights and the
import or export of goods bearing a forged trade mark under the
Trade Descriptions Ordinance, the government said.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal underlines again our determination to protect
intellectual property rights," a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
With the offenses specified under Schedule 1 to the OSCO,
Customs and Excise officers would have additional legal powers to
investigate piracy and counterfeiting offenses, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"These cover the production of material for investigation,
handling of crime proceeds and enhanced sentencing," he added.
</P>
<P>
If organized crime as defined in OSCO is involved, two
additional powers, confiscation of proceeds of offenses and the
removal of the right to silence, are available.
</P>
<P>
"With the additional legal tools, we will be able to deal more
severely with infringes," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"More legislative proposals are in the pipeline, for example,
prevention of bootlegging. The message is clear: piracy and
counterfeiting activities will not be tolerated in Hong Kong," the
spokesman emphasized.

<HEADLINE> China Scores Breakthrough in Study of Mammal Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved a
breakthrough in the study of the origin of mammals with the
discovery of a large number of fossilized mammal bones dating back
some 100 million years in northeastern China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The fossils, including teeth, jawbones, vertebra and limbs,
belonged to a kind of small animal living in the Mesozoic Period,
said Zhang Pulin, who discovered these fossils along a 80-meter-
long and 50-meter-wide stratum in summer.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that it is quite rare to find mammal bones of the
Mesozoic Period, when the dinosaur dominated the world.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the discovery will provide valuable
materials for the study of mammal origins, which will be the
hottest topic among the world's archeological in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Similar Mesozoic fossils have also been discovered in the
western region of Liaoning Province, also in northeastern China,
where Sinornithosaurus, believed to be the ancestor of birds, were
unearthed. But local archeologists believe these belonged to a
different family.

<HEADLINE> Industrialization Way Forward For China's Rural Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China should upgrade its rural
economy by promoting the industrialization of agriculture,
according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
"The industrialization of agriculture must be the way forward
for China's rural economy," said Song Jian, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, China's highest advisory body.
</P>
<P>
Song, also president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
made the remarks at the ongoing International Symposium and
Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing Technology and
Industrialization, sponsored by the Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific of the United Nations and several other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in rural China as a result of
the reform and opening-up drive, Song said, but the country has
just begun efforts to industrialize and modernize agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China's rural economy has been facing a series of problems,
including inadequate intensive production and mechanized
operations, according to Song.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Song said, China grows hundreds of millions of
tons of vegetables and 9.5 million tons of fruit annually, but
these huge harvests are mainly brought about by traditional
methods which are technically backward and consume too many
resources.
</P>
<P>
Song said one of the major tasks facing Chinese science and
technology in the coming century is the all-out promotion of
agricultural industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts will be taken to develop high-tech farm produce
and processing machinery in a bid to accelerate this process and
increase the value of agricultural products, Song said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing symposium and exhibition will have a positive
effect on the modernization of China's rural economy, Song said.

<HEADLINE> Natural Habitats Crucial for Siberian Tiger Protection: Zoologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We need to intensify international cooperation, set up natural
reserves, and ensure a smooth communication channel for the wild
Siberian tigers, so as to save the species from extinction," said
Dr. Dale G. Miquelle, Field Coordinator of the Siberian Tiger
Project under the WCS.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists point out that excessive hunting, de-afforestation
and the fast spread of housing areas have caused the rapid
decrease in the Siberian tiger population.
</P>
<P>
"In the past two decades, its number has decreased from over 80
to some twenty to thirty in the early 1990s," said Guan Guosheng
with the Heilongjiang WRI.
</P>
<P>
Some natural living areas suitable for the tigers still exist,
said Dr.Zhang Endi, in charge of the Asia Conservation
Communication Program. And the Central Government's efforts in
natural forest protection, together with the fact that there
remain over 300 Siberian tigers in the Russian border area, make
the protection possible.
</P>
<P>
Setting up a Sino-Russian natural reserve and an efficient
control network, and issuing related regulations will benefit the
protection, Dr. Miquelle said.
</P>
<P>
The investigation by the Wildlife Conservation Society, the
Hornocker Wildlife Research Institute, and the Heilongjiang
Wildlife Research Institute (WRI) in the province starting from
1998 reveals that now only between nine and 13 Siberian tigers
live in the forests of Wandashan Mountain, Laoye Mountain, and the
Changbai Mountains.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Israeli Agricultural Cooperation Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China could introduce overseas
advanced agricultural technology in an all-round way in some of
its provinces and regions, as a good way to accelerate the country
's agricultural upgrading.
</P>
<P>
This is a view shared by Chinese and overseas experts attending
the ongoing International Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and
Vegetable Processing Technology and Industrialization, which
opened on October 12 in the coastal city of Yantai in eastern
Shandong Province and will run through October 16.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is cited as an ideal choice for agricultural
cooperation with Israel, thanks to their similar climates.
</P>
<P>
Xuan Zengpei, an official of Chinese Academy of Engineering,
said that the popularization of greenhouses used for growing
vegetables in Shandong has set a good foundation for the province
to widely introduce irrigation technology and fine seeds from
Israel to further develop local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Located in an arid area, Israel is renowned for advanced
irrigation technologies, which carry weight in agricultural
development in the country and have helped quadruple its
agricultural output on the whole, said Nathan Shunari,
agricultural attache of the Israeli Embassy in China.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed Israel's efficient agriculture to high-level
industrialization. Israel's investment in the development of
agricultural technology accounts for 30 percent of the country's
GNP.
</P>
<P>
China is now in great need of fostering farm products
processing companies and furthering agricultural technological
improvement, said Xuan Zengpei, adding that China should increase
economic and technological exchanges as well as cooperation with
foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Southernmost Chinese Province Plans AIDS-Control Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 14 (Xinhua) -- In order to prevent the spread
of AIDS, the island province of Hainan in southernmost China has a
plan to stop the virus from being transmitted through blood
donation channels, a major cause of AIDS infection on the island.
</P>
<P>
The plan underscores the importance of popularizing AIDS
education and knowledge about the ways sexually transmitted
diseases can be combated to the rural population. Related topics
will also be included in school textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Next year, five to six monitoring centers will be set up
offering regular examinations for venereal disease carriers, drug
addicts, and blood donator.
</P>
<P>
The province will also establish advanced AIDS consultations
and treatment and service centers as well as specialized medical
teams. The monitoring and instruction about the disease will be
given to communities who will be urged to set up an AIDS-control
network.
</P>
<P>
Hainan detected the first case of AIDS in 1991. Since then, 29
out of 140,000 people who received blood tests were found HIV
positive, and six of them died of AIDS. Experts believe that the
number of people in the province now contaminated has reached more
than 300.

<HEADLINE> Boeing 100-Seat Jets Arouse Interest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 717-200 regional jet, a
new member of the Boeing plane family, today ended its four-day
showcase tour in China after a number of Chinese air companies
announced their intention to buy the aircraft for their fleets.
</P>
<P>
The 100-seat plane, designed for short-distance passenger
flights, has been the star attraction in seven air shows in
Beijing, Wuhan, Kunming and Xiamen since last Sunday, when the jet
arrived in Beijing from the United States.
</P>
<P>
A dozen Chinese airlines, including Wuhan, Yunnan, Shenzhen and
Xiamen air companies, have shown interest in the regional jets and
three of them have expressed their intent to purchase.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the jet successfully took off at Tianhe
International Airport in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, despite rain and visibility of less than 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
"We will buy five such planes," Cheng Yaokun, general manager
of Wuhan Air Company, told Ray Bracy, President of Boeing China
Inc.
</P>
<P>
"The regional jet costs less to fly, produces little noise, and
demonstrates fine safety performance. It will suit our company
that operates a great number of regional air services," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
In Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province where
air service is brisk, Duan Shenghu, flight engineer-in-chief with
Yunnan Air Company, attended two air shows featuring the jet in
one day.
</P>
<P>
"I have been responsible for purchase of regional planes for 15
years and I found the new Boeing regional jet has demonstrated
good capabilities and is well equipped," Duan said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, all 21 planes of his company are from the
Boeing airplane family. But the company is still short of planes
suited to short-distance flights within Yunnan Province, a
mountainous region which abounds in tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
Regional planes are those that have flight distance ranging
from 500 km to 1,500 km and have about 100 seats each.
</P>
<P>
In the next two decades, the world will need 2,600 planes each
with seats ranging from 80 to 120, but the need for big planes
like the Boeing 747 only stands at 930, according to specialists.
Therefore, developing regional planes featuring good capabilities
and low operation costs will become an important field where the
world's plane manufacturers will compete fiercely.
</P>
<P>
Research on Boeing 717-200 passenger planes started in 1995.
The first such aircraft was delivered in September this year. Air
companies from the United States and Europe have placed orders for
128 Boeing 717-200 planes, sources said.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Scholar Commemorated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 Chinese and
foreign scholars gathered in this capital of southwest China's
Guizhou Province today to discuss the important role an ancient
Chinese thinker may have in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
At an international seminar that opened here today, scholars
from the United States, Japan, Russia, China and the regions of
Taiwan and Hong Kong will exchange views on the study of Wang
Shouren, widely known as Wang Yangming, a famous thinker,
philosopher and educator of the Ming Dynasty ((1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Tour to the ruins of the home of this ancient scholar has also
been arranged along with trade and investment promotion activities.
</P>
<P>
Wang was banished to Guizhou from the then capital city of
Nanjing, where he served as a senior official, for displeasing an
influential eunuch by speaking out from a sense of justice. While
staying in Guizhou, he trained many people by giving lectures
everywhere and cultivated a unique philosophical system.
</P>
<P>
His idea of stressing the unity of individual, society, nature
and heavenly laws can be equated to Western cultural values such
as equality and liberty, and his thinking has held an important
position not only in China for hundreds of years, but has also
influenced people in Japan and Korea, said one participant.

<HEADLINE> China Needs to Improve Freshness-Preservation Technology: Russian Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China needs to strengthen the
development and application of fruit and vegetable freshness-
preservation technology to ensure product quality and sharpen the
competitive edge in the global market, a renowned Russian
horticulture expert said today.
</P>
<P>
"Fresh-keeping facilities are essential to ensure that fruit
and vegetables retain their taste. This is the main appeal for
global customers," said Gudkovskl Vladimir Alexandrovich, director
of the I.V.Michurin All-Russian Research Institute of Horticulture,
one of the world's leading academic institution on horticulture
development.
</P>
<P>
The professor was airing his view at a workshop on agriculture
technology and know-how in Yantai, a port city in east China's
Shandong Province. The seminar was part of the International
Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing
Technology and Industrialization, the first ever held in China,
which is runs through October 16.
</P>
<P>
The lack of advanced technology for keeping fruit and
vegetables fresh has long plagued the growth of the fruit and
vegetable processing industry in many developing countries in Asia,
including China, and has ruined 50 to 60 percent of their harvest
every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's largest fruit and vegetable
producers, with an annual production of hundreds of millions of
tons, but much of this is ruined every year due to poor fresh-
keeping facilities and technology.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that Russian research institutions and high-
tech enterprises are willing to come to China's aid with advanced
technology and facilities, and that exchange and cooperation in
this regard between the two countries is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
Russia has developed freshness preservation and storing
technology for a variety of fruits. For example, it boasts a newly
developed storehouse equipped with advanced air-conditioning and
control systems which sharply reduce the amount of oxygen. Under
these conditions, apples can retain their look, taste, and
freshness up to 10 months after they are picked.
</P>
<P>
"I hope there will be more channels for technology talent of
both countries to cooperate in order to contribute to the
development of more advanced agricultural know-how," he said.

<HEADLINE> Patriotic Song Warmly Greeted in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The song entitled "Five Star
National Flag" presented during the evening gala celebrating the
50th anniversary of the founding of New China was warmly received
by the Chinese and caused a great stir nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The patriotic song, composed specially for the 50th anniversary,
has been turned into a MTV program featuring a variety of flag-
raising scenes, by the Beijing Television Station.
</P>
<P>
Although the song has a political theme, it has gained great
popularity among the Chinese because of its beautiful melody,
inspiring lyrics, and the patriotism the five star national flag
stands for in the hearts of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The five star national flag represents the past tribulations of
the Chinese people, their pleasure in victory, and their great
expectations for the future, according to the song's composer,
Tian Ming.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the song will bring everyone together, by inspiring
patriotism and idea of national cohesion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yongfeng, a renowned Chinese mountain climber, said he
felt his heart quake when he heard the song. "The song is so
inspiring to me because the five star national flag is a sacred
symbol to every alpinist," he said. "During the final sprint
toward the summit, a climber may abandon camera, food, clothing,
and even oxygen, but the flag is something indispensable and we
must plant it on the summit we have conquered."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Interim reports of the 29
township enterprises listed on China's Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges indicate that their profits for the first six months of
the year outgrew the average for all domestic listed companies.

operations, up 51.9 percent from the same period last year, and 39.
43 percent higher than the national average for all listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
Their net profits hit 1.612 billion yuan, up 22.49 percent, and
17.65 percentage points higher than the average.

<HEADLINE> Flags in Tanzania Fly at Half-mast for 30 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Thursday ordered flags to fly at half-mast for 30
days in memory of late leader Julius Nyerere who died of leukemia
at the age of 77 in a London hospital in the morning.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Tanzanian government has suspended all
sports or cultural activities indefinitely in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam, national anthems were
played by TV or radio stations on and off to remember Nyerere who
led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Flags of both ruling and opposition parties as well as foreign
embassies were seen flying at half-mast.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Chama Cha Maendeleo na Demokrasia (CHADEMA),
Bob Makani, said he would send heartfelt condolences to President
Mkapa for the premature and sad demise of Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party Civic United Front (CUF) has also
sent condolences to Mkapa, saying the party joins millions of
Tanzanians in mourning Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe that Mwalimu (teacher) Nyerere is gone
forever," said Alhaj Salum Katungunya, who is one of the early
founding members of the then Tanganyikan African National Union
(TANU) and ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Culture in the Ministry of Education and
Culture, Daniel Ndagala, said that the suspension decision has
been made to enable all Tanzanians to mourn their fixtures following the gover
ent's
suspension of sports activities.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was an ardent sports fan and took part in various
sports activities. His most favorite game was "bao".
</P>
<P>
During his presidency, Nyerere's notable achievement was
Tanzania's participation in the 1980 Africa Cup of Nation Finals
in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from neighboring Kenya said that
President Daniel arap Moi said that flags in his country will fly
at half-mast for four days beginning Friday following the death of

<P>
But despite their superb economic performance, township
enterprises still face many obstacles in their attempts to become
listed, and the total number of listed township enterprises
account for only about 4 percent on the domestic stock market.
</P>
<P>
"This is not conducive to township enterprises reform, nor to
their competition with state-owned enterprises on an equal footing,
" he said, noting that such a small percentage of listed
enterprises does not jibe with the status of township enterprises
in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, and especially since late 1970s,
township enterprises have witnessed remarkable development and now
constitute the main part of the rural economy, representing almost
half of the country's industrial sector and a pillar of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Statistics indicates that in 1998,
rural businesses realized an added output value of 2.2186 trillion
yuan, making up 27.9 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
At the same time, these businesses contributed one-fifth of
all national tax revenues and 34.8 percent of the country's total
exports.
</P>
<P>
China's township enterprises have maintained a momentum of
steady growth so far this year. From January to August, they
reported a total output value added of 1.6213 trillion yuan, up 16.
8 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
 The official called for more attention to be paid to the
importance of listing township enterprises and more support in
this regard.

BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Prof. Lun Jingguang from
Qinghua University said that China should speed up its research on
electric vehicles to protect the country's environment and promote
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
Lun was speaking at the 16th International Electric Vehicle
Symposium, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Lun pointed out that electric vehicles produce no exhaust
emission -- one culprit responsible for China's worsening air
quality.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surplus electricity generated in the evening can be
used for battery charging for electric vehicles, said Lun.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China generated 270 million kwh of electricity, 60
million of which were surplus and can be used for battery charging
for 12 million electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Lun noted that the research on hybrid vehicles and fuel cell
vehicles is now a trend, adding that the hybrid vehicle, with its
advantages of having both an internal-combustion engine and
batteries, will have a larger market in China in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, the Toyota Motor Corporation has sold 30,000 hybrid
vehicles. Other major auto makers, such as General Motors, are
also doing research on them.

<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua)-- The U.S.-based Federal Express (
FedEx) corporation will open a new air-cargo route next month
between the United States and Shenzhen in south China.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Representative Office of FedEx, there
will be five flights a week on the new route using DC-10 and MD-11
aircraft, based on an agreement signed by FedEx and the Shenzhen
Airport.
</P>
<P>
"As an important gateway to southern China, Shenzhen is an
integral part of our express transport networks in China, the Asia-
Pacific region and in the world," said Michael Ducker, president
of FedEx Asia Pacific Division, adding that the new service will
benefit both exporters and importers.
</P>
<P>
FedEx began service from the United States to Beijing and
Shanghai in 1996 as the only foreign air freight company with the
right to fly its own aircraft to and from China.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Airport expects to enhance its position as a major
air-cargo center in south China and a significant international
trans-shipment center in the region with the new service, said Lu
Shenhai, president of Shenzhen Airport Co.
</P>
<P>
The airport is capable of handling up to 250,000 tons of cargo
annually, and is equipped with the most advanced container-cargo

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cooperatives Erasing Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The supply and marketing
cooperatives (SMC) in China erased 370 million yuan in deficits in
the first eight months this year, basically holding the money-
losing trend in check.
</P>
<P>
SMC is a non-governmental farmers' organization. It is also a
key channel of commodity purchase and sales in China's rural areas.
It was born out of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the transition from a planned economy to a market-
orientated economy, the problems of cooperatives such as staff
redundancy, low-efficiency and lack of competitiveness have become
increasingly apparent.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued a circular early this year urging an
immediate system reform to reverse the loss-making trend of
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives,
the administrative body of grassroots cooperatives, has enhanced
efforts in reshaping money-losing enterprises by adopting the
shareholding system, acquisition and merger.
</P>
<P>
Li Dianhui, who is with the organization and attending the
fifth Asia-Pacific Cooperative Ministers' Conference being held in
Beijing, said that cooperatives are striving to make profits, and
"at least not to lose money in operation this year."
</P>
<P>
Although the downward trend is not reversed, the number of
money-losing enterprises were reduced by a large margin, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has a total of 30,000 cooperatives at all levels, with
cooperative members exceeding 180 million.

<HEADLINE> China to Levy Tax on Bank Account Interest in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China will begin to levy tax on
the interest of savings accounts on November 1, the government
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The 20-percent tax will be levied on the interest of all
Renminbi and foreign currency savings accounts that an individual
person opened in banks in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the interest that the savings accounts generated
before November 1 will be exempt.
</P>
<P>
The State Council announced here today that the government will
not levy tax on savings accounts exclusively for educational
purposes and other special savings accounts and funds that the
finance authorities has designated.
</P>
<P>
In August, the Chinese government activated the long-inactive
clause on interest tax in the Law on Individual Income Tax in a
move to stimulate consumption by residents.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Finance said that the new tax is
like an interest rate cut by one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
The government believes that imposing the interest tax will
help take from the rich to pay the poor because about ten percent
of the population own 50 percent of the total savings deposits in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Finance, the tax money will be
used to raise economic assistance for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, China's total savings deposits soared to 5,
910 billion yuan, compared to 1,520 billion yuan at the end of
1993.
</P>
<P>
However, China's retail prices have been falling for more than
20 consecutive months as economists rang alarms for deflation.

<HEADLINE> HK Land Sale Attracts Lukewarm Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Lands
Department sold two government lots for a total of 706 million HK
dollars (90.5 million US dollars) at a public auction Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's biggest property developer, Cheung Kong (Holdings)
Ltd., won the bid for a 14,435 square meter site in rural Tin Shui
Wai for 555 million HK dollars (71.15 million U.S. dollars),
slightly higher than the opening price of 500 million (64.1
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The smaller lot of 2,267 square meters in the luxury
residential area of Repulse Bay attracted keen bidding with the
government offering it for 120 million HK dollars (15.38 million U.
S. dollars). It was sold to Fu Hop International Investment Co.
Ltd., a registered shell company, for 151 million HK dollars (19.
23 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected the two sites put on sale by the
government to raise around one billion HK dollars (128.2 million U.
S. dollars), and the outcome indicated that a recovery in the
property market still had some way to go.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the land developers are cautious but active
as the land auction was seen as a key test for the health of the
property sector, one of the mainstays of the Hong Kong economy.
</P>
<P>
But over the past six months property prices have edged upwards
by about 10-15 percent, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth land auction by the HK government. On April
20, the government's first land sale in nine months raised almost
1.5 billion dollars (192.3 million U.S. dollars), beating market
projections of 1.2 billion dollars (153.8 million U.S. dollars)
for three residential plots on offer.
</P>
<P>
The government suspended its land sales program at the end of
June last year in a bid to shore up sagging property prices that
had been hit hard by the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Chief to Visit Saudi Arabia Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen is due in Saudi Arabia next Tuesday for talks with
Saudi leaders on regional security and the situation in Iraq,
western diplomats said in Riyadh on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay in the Gulf kingdom, Cohen will meet
Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz and his counterpart Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz, the
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will attach great emphasis on the situation in Iraq and
on how to restore order in the region, they added. But they did
not go into details.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has 5,000 troops in a military base in Saudi Arabia
and the U.S. warplanes regularly take off from the base to enforce
the no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq were imposed by
the U.S.-led western alliance following the 1991 Gulf War, sparked
by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies claimed that they carved out the no-fly
zones to protect the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the
south from Baghdad's possible attacks.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's visit to Saudi Arabia is part of his seven-nation
regional tour, which will also take him to Kuwait, Bahrain, the
United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan and Israel, according to the
Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the Saudi defense chief is scheduled to
visit Washington early next month for talks with U.S. leaders on
boosting political, security and defense cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Continues Work to Control Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The national capital launched
the third stage of its anti-air-pollution campaign today by
proposing a set of 22 measures to reduce the volume of air
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has implemented a set of 46 measures to take air
pollution under control since late 1998, according to Zhao Yixin,
director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Zhao told the press today that Beijing has made progress in
controlling air pollution thanks to effective measures to curb
local air pollution caused by coal burning, auto exhaust emissions,
and dust and suspended dirt particles.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sulfur dioxide density in the air in the past
nine months of this year fell an average of 25 percent from the
same period last year. The amount of nitride and oxide in Beijing'
s air remained at the same level as last year, even though the
city's number of automobiles has been increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The new measures will focus on the control of coal-burning and
auto-exhaust emissions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial firms are all required to meet the city's
standards in environmental protection before the end of the year
2000, or they will be shut down, Zhao said.

<HEADLINE> CCT Telecom to Continue Invest in China's Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The investment environment in
China's mainland is becoming better and better, according to
Clement Mak, chairman of CCT Telecom Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong-
based integrated information technology services provider.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom will continue to invest on telecom projects in the
mainland as the company's business there has enjoyed a smooth
development in the past years, Flora Cheng, executive director of
the company, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom, originally a manufacturer of telecom products and
electronic and plastic components, started its telecom networks
business in 1997 by cooperating with China Unicom in investing on
GSM networks in northern China's Shanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Later on, the company took part in China Unicom's GSM networks
project in Shanghai, the biggest city in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, CCT Telecom has invested more than 500 million HK
dollars (64 million U.S. dollars) in the GSM networks in China's
mainland and the company has begun to make profits from the
investment.
</P>
<P>
The company now has several factories on the mainland to
manufacture dual and trio band mobile phones and other telecom
products.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1998, CCT Telecom began entering Hong Kong'
s Internet market by buying HK Net. Eight months later, HK Net
ranked 2nd in the share of Internet market in Hong Kong with 160,
000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
HK Net is a provider of diversified Internet services including
ISP, IDD, Portal/ICP, E-Commerce, VPN, Security, System
integration, Web hosting and co-location and Web design.
</P>
<P>
HK Net has been recently elected the 4th Internet company in
Asia by Telecom Asia Magazine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Japan's NTT Communication Corporation bought
49 percent of the shares of HK Net, becoming a strategic partner
of HK Net.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom is planning to list HK Net on the NASDAQ stock
exchange of the United States at the beginning of next year and
the company is now applying for the fixed wireless license and the
external gateway license from the government.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom is making efforts to become a global telecom
operator in the future, Mak said.

<HEADLINE> Nations Issue Antelope Conservation Declaration in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The international community took
the first bold step forward here today to coordinate efforts in
the fight against rampant poaching and smuggling of Tibetan
antelope, one of the world's most endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Seven countries jointly issued the Xining Declaration on the
Conservation and Control of Trade in Tibetan Antelope in this
capital city of northwest China's Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
The declaration describes in detail the responsibilities of the
countries concerned in protecting the endangered species and
controlling the trade of products made from the animal.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the governments of the countries to support this
move by providing necessary funds, technology and material aid. It
also urges the countries that process and sell cashmere products
to increase publicity about the conservation of Tibetan antelope.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was jointly issued by more than 80
representatives from government organs, non-government
organizations and experts from China, France, India, Italy, Nepal,
Britain and the United States, as well as personages from relevant
international conservationist organizations.
</P>
<P>
They were here to attend a three-day seminar on conservation
and control of the trade of Tibetan antelope which closed today.
</P>
<P>
The animal lives in the remote Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
southwest China. Poachers hunted the animal for its fur, used to
make cashmere, which was smuggled to India and Nepal for
processing and later sold in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been sternly cracking down on
poaching and smuggling of Tibetan antelope. It has also set up
nature reserves for the animal.
</P>
<P>
India, Nepal, France, Britain and Italy have also taken
measures to combat smuggling and wipe out the black market trade
of cashmere from Tibetan antelope.

<HEADLINE> HK Enhances Legislation Against Piracy, Counterfeiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
announced Thursday that copyright piracy and trade mark
counterfeiting offenses would be added into the Organized and
Serious Crises Ordinance (OSCO), subject to the approval of the
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
The offenses to be included are related to the making or
dealing with infringing copies of copyright works under the
Copyright Ordinance and infringement of trade mark rights and the
import or export of goods bearing a forged trade mark under the
Trade Descriptions Ordinance, the government said.
</P>
<P>
"The proposal underlines again our determination to protect
intellectual property rights," a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
With the offenses specified under Schedule 1 to the OSCO,
Customs and Excise officers would have additional legal powers to
investigate piracy and counterfeiting offenses, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"These cover the production of material for investigation,
handling of crime proceeds and enhanced sentencing," he added.
</P>
<P>
If organized crime as defined in OSCO is involved, two
additional powers, confiscation of proceeds of offenses and the
removal of the right to silence, are available.
</P>
<P>
"With the additional legal tools, we will be able to deal more
severely with infringes," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"More legislative proposals are in the pipeline, for example,
prevention of bootlegging. The message is clear: piracy and
counterfeiting activities will not be tolerated in Hong Kong," the
spokesman emphasized.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pentagon Reviews Kosovo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States must
improve its electronic combat power for future wars in the light
of the Yugoslav army's ability to maintain its air defenses in the
face of heavy NATO bombing, U.S. Defense Department officials told
Congress Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Air Force RC-135 electronic eavesdropping planes and Navy
and Marine Corps EA-6B electronic attack aircraft were stretched
thin against a formidable Serb air defense, Defense Secretary
William Cohen and Joint Chiefs Chairman Henry H. Shelton said in
an "after-action review" of Operation Allied Force, the 78-day
NATO campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs successfully husbanded most of their best air defense
weapons, prompting NATO commanders to keep allied attack planes at
higher altitudes, thus reducing their effectiveness against ground
targets.
</P>
<P>
"We need to find innovative and affordable ways to exploit our
technological skills in electronic combat to bring greater
pressure to bear on a future enemy's air defense system," Cohen
and Shelton said in a joint written statement summarizing the
findings thus far in an ongoing Pentagon study of the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Cohen and Shelton presented the 18-page statement at a Senate
Armed Services Committee hearing on the war. A fuller study,
headed by Cohen's and Shelton's top deputies, is due in January
2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
54th General Assembly (GA) session, Theo-Ben Gurirab, Thursday
voiced his "deep personal sadness" of the death of the former
Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere, saying that "the African
people as a whole have lost an ardent pan-Africanist."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Guirab, also the Namibian foreign
minister, said, "It is with deep personal sadness that I learnt of
the passing of Mwalimu (Teacher) Julius K. Nyerere, first
President of the United Republic of Tanzania, venerable world
leader and one of Africa's most charismatic and respected elder
statesmen."
</P>
<P>
The former president died overnight in London at the age of 77,
after suffering from leukemia.
</P>
<P>
"I, too, was a beneficiary of Mwalimu's political tutelage and
of Tanzania;s generosity; they provided me a free haven when I
fled my own country Namibia, in 1962, to escape South Africa's
brutal colonialism in Namibia," the GA president said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Tanzanian people have lost the father of the nation, the
courageous leader of their independence struggle and the architect
of the United Republic of Tanzania," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The African people as a whole lost an ardent pan-Africanist, a
man of high principles, a man of self-abnegation and the champion
of Africa's self-determination, liberation and independence," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Without Dr. Nyerere's firm guidance and steadfast support, the
struggle for liberation, particularly in southern Africa, would
hv
have been more difficult and divisive within the ranks of the OAU,
th Non-Aligned Movement and other freedom-loving forces in the
world," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> China Learning a Lot from Climate Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A series of climate experiments
designed to improve weather forecasts show that rising hot-air
currents over the Tibetan plateau and the South China Sea are
stronger than once thought.
</P>
<P>
Top China Meteorological Administration (CMA) official Wen
Kegang was quoted as saying that hot air masses rising over the
plateau are bigger than expected.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists determined that the air waves include a tropical
squall line that can cause waterspouts over the South China sea.
</P>
<P>
"Analysis and understanding of these results will help us
better understand atmospheric motions and the rules governing the
interactions of related spheres and layers," Wen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wen pledged to get to the bottom of climate shifts affecting
storms in the Asian monsoon region and in the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The research was initiated in 1996 and carried out largely in
the summer of 1998. Using modern technology and large fields of
observation, the meteorologists did atmospheric-ocean-hydrological
tests in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the South China Sea, the
Huaihe River and the Taiwan Straits, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
Research also revealed the special characteristics and
complexity of the plateau's atmospheric structure, Wen said in his
latest report on the experiments. These projects had financial
backing from the country's Ministry of Science and Technology and
the National Natural Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The four experiments, involving 29 provinces, municipalities
and key industrial cities, also show China's advanced
meteorological level and ability to coordinate scientists at home
and abroad to undertake large atmospheric experiments.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, China is expected to make contributions to global
atmospheric research and to break through in the field," CMA's
experts said, adding that some 100 foreign experts jointed hands
with more than 500 senior Chinese meteorologists to do the tests.

<HEADLINE> Mass Action to Protect Antelope in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING October 14 (Xinhua)-- An international jointed action
aimed at protecting the endangered Tibetan antelope is expected to
kick off soon, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The antelope face the threat of extinction because of massive
illegal hunting. The antelope are in high demand for their
underwool, used to make shawl known as "shahtoosh."
</P>
<P>
"Such a step has been in the works for years, as the illegal
poaching in China, the country of antelope's origin, and the
illicit manufacturing and trade of shahtoosh in processing and
consuming countries, defy the common wish of mankind to protect
wildlife," a leading Chinese forestry official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The root of the poaching is that the process and trade of
shahtoosh still exists in certain countries and regions as
poachers, processors and traders can obtain huge profits soaked in
the blood of Tibetan antelope," said Ma Fu, deputy-director of the
State Forestry Administration(SFA).
</P>
<P>
India-controlled Kashmir is the world's first and largest area
for the manufacturing of shahtoosh shawls. Most of the raw
materials for these luxury items has been smuggled from Tibet,
said one SFA expert.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shawls are sold in Europe. Since 1994, hundreds of
shahtoosh shawls have been seized or confiscated in France,
Belgium, the United States, Britain, Italy and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Charges on Religious Freedom (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese citizens enjoy full religious freedom. China is not
only a large country in terms of population, it is also a major
country in terms of religion, with schools of Buddhism, Taoism,
Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism and others, and a total of 100
million religious adherents among a national population of 1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
Religious adherents engage in various religious activities at
temples, mosques, churches and individual residences. There are
85,000 places of worship across the country, 300,000 clergymen,
over 3,000 religious organizations, and 74 religious seminaries
run by those organizations to train clergymen.
</P>
<P>
All religious organizations operate their own affairs
independently, run seminaries to suit their own needs, publish
their classical works and other publications, and have service
organs for the public interest.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Christianity, more than 20 million copies of the
Bible have been printed in the past ten and more years, making
Chinese Christianity the largest school of religion in the world
in terms of Bible publication.
</P>
<P>
Most religious figures praise the fact that this is the best
time for all the religions in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the U.S. State Department's report have put on
a masquerade of caring for the religious freedom in other
countries, and have been repetitiously producing legislative bills
and reports for the alleged purpose of improving religious freedom
in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Faced with the sound conditions of religion in China, they
still irresponsibly throw stones at China like a blind man feeling
a giant elephant. Can anyone believe they do not have ulterior
motives?

<HEADLINE> EU to Pay Partly for Chiluba's Shuttles for Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
release some 2.9 million U.S. dollars to Zambia to offset part of
the payments for President Frederick Chiluba's diplomatic shuttles
to mediate peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
This was stipulated in the memorandum of understanding signed
between EU Ambassador to Zambia Jochen Krebs and Zambian Permanent
Secretary of Finance Ministry Boniface Nonde here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The money will be released within weeks, an EU official said.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Nonde said that while his government
is trying very hard to further the mediation process as quickly as
possible, the peace process may take longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
"This is mainly due to the complexity of the issues at hand and
the number of parties involved," the Zambian official explained.
</P>
<P>
After signing the memorandum, Krebs told the press that the
Zambian government approached to EU on the financial assistance
for Chiluba's peace missions.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was mandated by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful solution to the war in the
third largest African country.

<HEADLINE> Ten Chinese Women Farmers Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- They have different lives.
They are master cultivators of grapes, flowers, fruit trees and
red peppers, and shepherdess and entrepreneurs. But all of them
are successful women farmers whom many men would envy.
</P>
<P>
Today, ten Chinese women farmers received awards from the All-
China Women's Federation for their remarkable achievements over
the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
The federation inaugurated a competition ten years ago among
Chinese women farmers, aiming to improve their education and
mobilize them to become devoted to agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the competition, more than 20 million illiterate
women received education and nearly 100 million of them were
trained in agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Among the ten award-winning women farmers today was Cheng
Xianxin from the eastern suburbs of Beijing. She not only
cultivates delicious grapes, but has also spread her techniques to
more than other 10,000 farmers.
</P>
<P>
Ji Xihua, a farmer in east China's Jiangsu Province,
established China's largest production base for azalea flowers,
and her flowers are sold to more than 150 cities across China.
</P>
<P>
Niu Yuqin from the Jingbian County in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province has planted trees on more than 2,600 hectares of desert
over the past 14 years, and was awarded by the United Nations for
her efforts in ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
Other award-winners include Liu Fuyu, a fruit tree cultivation
expert, Chen Yunlian, pepper agronomist, and Liu Zhihua, founder
of 13 rural enterprises, also received awards today.

<P>
In order to maintain stability and unity in Xinjiang and assure
the safety and normal life of local Moslems, the local government
has stood firmly against religious extremism and has cracked down
on violence and terrorist activities in accordance with law, and
as requested by the local people themselves.
</P>
<P>
The effort made by the government, therefore, is fully
justified, as separatist activity would in no way be tolerated by
any country in the world, and would be dealt with firmly.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the report, who regard as abnormal the legally
justifiable punishment against the very small number of
separatists and terrorists, went on to make accusations against
China. Judging by their accusations, people can see very clearly
what they support and what they oppose.
</P>
<P>
The report does not mind taking the trouble to list many "
individual" issues in a bid to accuse China of conducting what it
calls religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Chinese government is committed to
freedom of religious belief. And the Chinese Constitution and laws
provide Chinese citizens full guarantees for freedom of religious
belief and legal religious activity, therefore there is no
question of an issue of religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
Under the Chinese Constitution, every Chinese citizen enjoys
equal rights and obligations in the eyes of the law, and any
person who commits any criminal act is subject to criminal
prosecution regardless of their religious belief.
</P>
<P>
No single person in China has been or will be detained or
imprisoned simply because of their religious beliefs or their
legal religious activities. On the contrary, stipulations have
been made within China's criminal laws saying that any government
employee who illegally deprives any citizens of their freedom of
religious belief is subject to up to two-year imprisonment, or
criminal detention according to the seriousness of the case. But
those who use religion as a camouflage for illegal activities will
be dealt with firmly according to law.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The intellectual property
system plays an important role in supporting the development of
the knowledge-based economy, China's top IP official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The development of the knowledge-based economy can't live
without the IP system," Jiang Ying, director of the State
Intellectual Property Office (SIPO), said at the ongoing
International Symposium on Intellectual Property and Knowledge-
based Economy organized by the World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) and the SIPO.
</P>
<P>
"The IP system is an important legal system encouraging the
creation, dissemination and application of knowledge based on the
acknowledgment that knowledge is an asset and needs protection,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"To develop the knowledge-based economy requires not only
attaching importance to the creation, transfer and application of
knowledge, but also paying more attention to protection," she said.
</P>
<P>
"When trade barriers such as tariffs are canceled in the next
century, the competition of comprehensive national strength will
focus on knowledge," the director said.
</P>
<P>
Facing the challenges of the new century, many nations have
devised IP protection strategies, accelerated the enactment of IP
laws, and stiffened the enforcement of IP protection to take full
advantage of the IP system for maintaining their favorable status
in the world, she said.

<P>
Modern society has established the IP system to protect and
encourage people's creativity, and China also has been increasing
safeguards for IP rights in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
In the 14 years since the promulgation of the Chinese Patent
Law, patent applications in China have increased dramatically
every year.
</P>
<P>
The total number of domestic patent applications in 1998
reached 96,223, compared to 9,411 in 1985.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August this year, total domestic patent
applications received by the country's patent offices totaled 794,
457.
</P>
<P>
"Under the IP system, most technology inventions are disclosed
to the general public through documentation," Jiang said. "Under
the market economy, the IP system has an important role in
assuring the reasonable distribution of knowledge-production
resources."
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) has devised an agreement to
urge all countries to obey certain regulations relating to IP in
the development of world trade.
</P>
<P>
New IP-related areas resulting from the development of
biotechnology, gene engineering, computer software and others,
symbolize a new phase of IP advancement, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
She called on countries throughout the world to enhance
exchange and cooperation in this regard to bring the IP system
into full play along with the development of the knowledge-based
economy.

BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China is carrying out a
nationwide revision of local records, aiming to faithfully mirror
historical events.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 historians and compilers have been involved
in the largest project of the kind in 20 years, renewing some 4,
000 volumes of chronicles, said Shan Tianlun, an official
responsible for directing the national job.
</P>
<P>
"Accuracy and documentary value are our top requirements for
the job, so that the history can be truly reflected," Shan
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The entire work includes 6,000 volumes of historical books with
a total six billion words.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition to display achievements of the massive effort
will soon be on view at the Museum of the Chinese Revolution,
which is located east of Tian'anmen Square in central Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Records compilation and revision have a history of over 2,000
years in China. This activity has not only enriched the country's
cultural heritage, but also provided reference for today's
policymakers, Shan said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has always paid attention to the local
chronicle revision work, even though it was suspended during the "

The following is the full text of the article:
</P>
<P>
The State Department of the United States recently issued its "
Annual Report on International Religious Freedom for 1999", which
irresponsibly commented on religious affairs in many countries,

as a country for "special concern" based on the "the

</P>
<P>
We are strongly indignant at and resolutely opposed to such
unfounded and unreasonable accusations.
</P>
<P>
The China section of the "Annual Report on International
Religious Freedom for 1999" is nothing new, but rumors, distortion,
fabrication and imagination with some brand-new packaging, plus
some threats as always, to create excuses for the implementation
of its International Religious Freedom Act.
</P>
<P>
We must solemnly point out with justice that in China, freedom
of religious belief is a fundamental right to which all citizens
are entitled by the Constitution and law and the problem of "
religious persecution" does not exist in China. Such fact can not
be distorted by anyone in any means.

</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department recently issued its "Annual Report

Instead of being concerned about its many domestic problems,

slanderous accusations against China's religious affairs and even

"This is in essence a wanton interference in China's internal

" The U.S. government must stop immediately interfering in
China's internal affairs under the pretext of religion," the

<TEXT>
<P>
The report alleges that in China, foreigners' religious
activities face more limits and monitorings and that preaching is
not allowed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The fact is that the Chinese government fully respects the
freedom in religious belief of all the foreigners within its
territory, and protects their normal religious activities.
</P>
<P>
"The Provision on the Administration of Religious Activities of
Aliens Within the Territory of the People's Republic of China,"
which was promulgated by the Chinese government in 1994,
categorically stipulates that China respects the freedom in
religious belief of aliens within its territory, and protects
friendly contacts and cultural and academic exchanges of aliens
with Chinese religious circles.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that aliens may participate in religious
activities at sites for religious activities within the Chinese
territory, may preach and expound their scriptures at Chinese
sites for religious activities at the invitation of Chinese
religious bodies at or above the level of provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities, may hold religious activities attended
by aliens at the sites for religious activities approved by the
department of religious affairs of the people's government at or
above the county level, may invite Chinese religious personnel to
hold such religious ceremonies as baptism, weddings, funerals, and
Taoist and Buddhist rites, and may carry into the country
religious printed matter, religious audio-visual products and
other religious articles for personal use.
</P>
<P>
Also, when China holds large international conferences, sports
events, and cultural and academic exchanges, organizers may apply
to the Chinese government for designating special religious sites
for the religious activities of foreign participants.

<HEADLINE> 22nd ISO Congress to Be Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The 22nd Congress of the
International Standardization Organization (ISO) will be held in
Beijing during October 20-22, the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision (SBQTS) announced here today at a meeting
marking the 30th World Standards Day.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first ISO Congress held in Beijing since the
organization was founded 52 years ago. So far, about 360 delegates
from 92 countries and over 10 international organizations have
signed up to participate in the congress.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the coming congress will be the making of key
policies and long-term strategic plans, technical aid and
personnel training for developing countries, and international
cooperation. A symposium, Living Quality in the 21st Century,
will also be held during the congress.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yiming, SBQTS deputy director, said the Chinese government
attaches great importance to cooperation with international
standardization organizations. Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
will be the honorary chairman of the congress, and SBQTS Director
Li Chuanqing will be the congress chairman.
</P>
<P>
China joined the ISO in 1978, and the law on standardization
was implemented in China ten years ago. Among the nearly 20,000
national standards, about 40 percent are international standards
and 22 percent are ISO standards.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Standards Day highlights the importance of
international standards in the construction sector. Construction
quality is also becoming a focus in Chinese society. To date,
China has issued nearly 300 national standards for construction
and over 450 national standards for construction materials.

<P>
The report also accuses China of "imposing restrictions on
construction of new mosques" in Xinjiang, and of having "arrested
and executed quite a few Moslems."
</P>
<P>
In fact, Moslems in Xinjiang have the complete right to enjoy
freedom of religious belief, and there are enough mosques in the
region to satisfy the religious needs of the Moslems.
</P>
<P>
Only a few ethnic separatists have been punished by Chinese law
enforcement departments for the violence and terrorist activities
they have committed, which has nothing to do with their religious
belief.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is a region with quite a few ethnic Islamic groups
that densely populate part of the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the system of ethnic regional autonomy, the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region has been established to ensure regional
ethnic autonomy, and people in the region fully enjoy their right
of religious belief as protected by law.
</P>
<P>
There are nine million Moslems in Xinjiang, accounting for half
of all the Moslems in China, but the number of mosques in the
region totals 23,000 and represents two-thirds of the total in
China, or one mosque for every 200 Moslems. More than 30,000
Moslems in Xinjiang have gone on the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi
Arabia in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The great majority of Islamic people in Xinjiang and other
religious believers there are patriotic and law-abiding and
conduct their religious activities as permitted by laws and
regulations and government policies.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the situation in Xinjiang can be
characterized as one of stability and unity among the different
ethnic groups. Terrorist activities in the past few years such as
murders and bombings committed by a very small number of ethic
separatists who use Islam as a camouflage have caused great
indignation among the Moslems of various ethnic groups who
strongly oppose such violence.

<P>
Some cults have existed in parts of China in recent years whose
leading members spread misinformation using religion as a
camouflage to deceive the general public, swindle money and
property from people, and sexually exploit women. These people are
hated bitterly by the general public and religious people. Taking
legal action against the leading members according to law is meant
to rid the people of a scourge and benefit the community.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, there is no country in the world which
allows illegal and criminal activities in the name of religion.
One has to ask why it was quite reasonable for the United States
to ban the Branch Davidian cult a few years ago, and Japan to
outlawed the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult, while China is being
accused of "persecuting religious people" simply because it banned
some cults?
</P>
<P>
While ignoring its own problems, including religious ones, the
United States has been making purely fictitious and improper
comments about China's religious affairs, willfully vilifying
China, and even threatening sanctions and demanding that China
amend its laws in a way preferred by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The key point at issue is the United States using the freedom
of religion as a camouflage to grossly interfere in China's
internal affairs, which is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese
government and people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government must immediately put an end to interfering
in China's internal affairs through the use of the so-called
religious issue.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Cellared Spirits to Be Auctioned in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The world's oldest cellared
spirits -- still drinkable -- will be auctioned later this month
in Beijing, according to the China Guardian Auctions Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago archeologists discovered the yellowish alcohol,
dating back 154 years, sealed in four wooden containers at an
ancient bodega in northeast China. It was later determined to be a
tribute to the imperial family of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The London-based Guinness Book of World Records confirmed it as
the "oldest cellared alcoholic tribute" in the world on July, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists, who also unearthed liquor-making equipment
at the same site, described the smell of the ancient drink as "
pleasantly fragrant." They believed the airtight wooden containers
and constant temperature helped preserve the drink.
</P>
<P>
State authoritative tests on food and beverage showed that the
liquor meets the state standards for safe drinking.
</P>
<P>
Guardian, China's biggest auctioneer, will separate 100 kg of
the spirits into 50 lots for auction.

During the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, religious
organizations and sites in the city of Beijing received over 10,
000 participants from 103 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a U.S. religious delegation led by Rabbi Arthur
Schneier, president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation,
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the Newark Roman Catholic
Archdiocese, and Reverend Don Argue, president of the National
Association of Evangelicals, visited China and was received by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Chairman Li Ruihuan of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to China the same year, U.S. President Bill
Clinton went with his family to the Chongwenmen Church in downtown
Beijing to attend Sunday morning services.
</P>
<P>
As a sovereign state, China has always held that its relations
with other countries should grow on the basis of friendship.
Aliens conducting any activities, including religious activities,
within the Chinese territory should naturally abide by China's
laws and regulations, and not undermine the country's public
interest, nor interfere in its internal affairs including
religious ones, nor preach or spread religious materials to the
public.
</P>
<P>
For those aliens that violate the country's laws and
regulations, Chinese law-enforcement departments have every right
to punish them according to law. If this is regarded as limiting
and monitoring aliens, one would like to ask whether the United
States allows aliens to engage in unlawful activities within its
territory.

<HEADLINE> Newly-discovered Minor Planet Named after CAS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese-discovered minor
planet has been named after its discoverer, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), CAS President Lu Yongxiang said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minor planet, discovered on March 11, 1996, by a group of
experts headed by CAS member Chen Jiansheng, is at least the 10th
minor planet found by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was later confirmed and recognized by the Minor
Planet Center under the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
</P>
<P>
The IAU announced earlier this year the minor planet had been
named "Zhongguo kexueyuan," which means "Chinese Academy of
Sciences," as proposed by CAS.
</P>
<P>
The president said that by naming the minor planet after the
academy, the leading research organization in China, it intended
to demonstrate the achievements it has made since it was founded
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The academy has made great contributions to the completion of
China's first nuclear bomb, hydrogen bomb and first man-made
satellite, the president said.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 minor planets have been officially named, Chen
Jiansheng said.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Charges on Religious Freedom (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with hackneyed and stereotyped expressions, the U.S.
report chooses bits and pieces with which to criticize China to
deny any achievements made by the Chinese government in the field.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the fact that the Chinese people have the right to
believe in religion, a right protected by Chinese law, the report'
s authors had to acknowledge the freedom of religious belief among
the Chinese on one hand, but repudiated the role of the law to
standardize social behavior in China on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report made the nonsensical charge that the
registration of religious places to the Chinese government means
strict control of religious groups and their activities.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Chinese government strives for better protection
for the legitimate rights of religious groups through registration,
in accordance with the Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
It is also an international practice to register social groups.
In China, any social group, including religious one, must apply
for registration from civil affairs authorities, a practice which
is in agreement with the management regulation for social groups.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the management regulations for religious
ritual places which was promulgated in 1994, appropriate religious
activities in ritual places should be protected by the law, and no
group or individual may infringe on religious people's legitimate
rights or intervene in their affairs.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also stipulates that all ritual places which
meet the legal requirements can be authorized to register. After
registration, the ritual place can obtain legitimate status, which
is fully safeguarded by the law.
</P>
<P>
If there are infringements on its legal rights, religious
groups and management bodies for religious activities may appeal
to governmental administrative organs or even people's courts to
seek legal settlement.

<P>
Therefore, Chinese religious figures uphold the regulation on
registration of religious places. If ordering religious groups to
register is a restriction, many nations and regions throughout the
world are implementing the very same "restriction."
</P>
<P>
What is the purpose of the U.S. criticizing the registration
regulation, a practice normal in many countries?
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. report talked nonsense about 30 million
Chinese people carrying out their Mass at "home churches". In fact,
there are no "house churches" in China.
</P>
<P>
Christians usually organize religious rituals in families,
which is only called a House Meeting. Christians who take part in
the House Meeting also join congregations in churches, except for
those who are too old or weak. House Meetings are just a
supplement to church meetings.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government respects these House Meetings and would
never intervene.
</P>
<P>
The authorities do not ask religious believers to register
these kinds of gatherings, and they neither intervene in nor
restrict their activities.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Chinese government has no specific statistics on
House Meetings. The U.S. report barely knows the facts about the
religious activities of the Chinese people, but rather fabricates
stories according to their own daydreams.
</P>
<P>
After randomly criticizing religious freedom and governmental
management in China, the U.S. report pretends to bewail the times
and pity the people, asking the Chinese government to revise its
laws and regulations and loosen the requirements for registration.
</P>
<P>
It is rude as well as naive for the U.S. to intervene in the
internal affairs of other nations and impose its own will on them.
</P>
<P>
In today's world, there is no nation with sovereignty that
follows up other nations' will or allows them to intervene in its
internal affairs.

BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Scientific cooperation among
Asian and European countries has great potential, Chinese Vice-
Premier Li Lanqing said at a banquet here this evening for the
first Science and Technology Ministers Meeting of the Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM).
</P>
<P>
Li said the meeting, which opened this morning, is the first
high-level meeting concerning regional scientific cooperation
between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
This meeting indicates that the scientific and technological
cooperation among Asian and European countries will enter a new
stage, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said statesmen, businesspeople and scientists from various
Asian and European countries have come to realize that further
coordination and promotion of scientific cooperation and
technological exchanges between the two continents will benefit
the scientific development of each and stimulate the regional
economic and social growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that the strengthening of cooperation will also promote
peace, stability and prosperity of other countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that China attaches importance to the
scientific and technological cooperation with Asian and European
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese Government has signed scientific
cooperation agreements with the governments of Japan, the Republic
of Korea, some members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and a number of European Union (EU) countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China signed with the EU a science and technology
agreement last December.
</P>
<P>
He said the scientific and technological cooperation between
Asian and European countries is mutually complementary, adding
that Asia has the manpower and is rich in resources of agriculture,
forestry and biological engineering.
</P>
<P>
Li said the European countries have vast experience in
scientific research, education, development of manpower resources
and industrialization of scientific discoveries.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the setting up of a scientific cooperation
mechanism by the ASEM members will benefit Asian and European
countries alike.

<HEADLINE> Voter Apathy, Divided Opposition to Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A combination of voter
apathy and a divided opposition will ensure an easy victory for
the right-wing ruling Botswana Democratic Party in Saturday's
general election, information from Gaborone here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Botswanan Independent Electoral Commission,
Gabriel Seeletso, confirmed that only 459,665 voters had
registered -- just 51 percent of the estimated eligible electorate
of some 900,000.
</P>
<P>
The last opinion poll, conducted in March by the University of
Botswana, showed that the ruling party would increase its
parliamentary majority from its current 31 seats in the 44-seat
national assembly.
</P>
<P>
The only uncertainty surrounds the identity of the official
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The country's biggest opposition, the centrist Botswana
Congress Party was formed only last year after a split within the
Botswana National Front, taking 11 of its 13 members of parliament
with it.
</P>
<P>
A total of seven parties will contest 40 seats Saturday, with a
further four MPs being appointed later by the president.
</P>
<P>
However, many political commentators believe that the
center-left Botswana National Front, led by veteran politician
Kenneth Koma, will stage a revival and could yet become the
official opposition.
</P>
<P>
President Festus Mogae, 60, who took office in April 1998 when
Ketumile Masire stepped down, will round off a low-key campaign
with an address at Gaborone's Freedom Square late Friday,
confident that his party will continue its grip on power, unbroken
in the 33 years since independence from Britain in 1966.

LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- All the pro-peace agreement
parties in Northern Ireland are holding round-table talks for the
first time in London as part of the review chaired by former U.S.
Senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
The round-table talks followed separate discussions on Thursday
morning involving the Ulster Unionists, Sinn Fein and the Social
Democratic and Labour Party.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the talks venue in Lancaster House in London,
Ulster Unionist Leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein President Gerry
Adams both said no progress had been made over the previous days.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell moved his review of the process to London on Tuesday
to intensify discussions between the parties in a private
location.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the atmosphere between the parties had improved
while Trimble said he was still committed to breaking the
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
When the London-based talks started, a spokesman for Mitchell
said they were expected to end on Thursday, but Mitchell would
come back to Belfast next week.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Mitchell has taken the parties away from
Stormont in Belfast since the review began last month.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks started on Tuesday, Mitchell said the review
was entering a "crucial phase".

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) Thursday mourned the death of the former Tanzanian
president, Julius Nyerere, saying that "the world has lost a
gentle and wondrous man."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the U.N. agency said that he was "a
man who consorted with kings and mingled with the masses in equal
egalitarian harmony."
</P>
<P>
"The death of President Julius Nyerere is one of those moments
which makes time stand still," the statement said. "It's the
silencing of a voice which, uninterrrupted for five decades, never
abandoned principle, never abandoned purpose, never abandoned
vision."
</P>
<P>
He "will always remain in memory as that slender, diminutive
figure of irresistibly infectious chuckle, with a mind so sharp as
to cut to the heart of every argument, but a tongue so kind as to
soothe the soul of every adversary," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout his life, Mwalimu (Teacher) ever-managed that
combination of intellect and generosity which made him so beloved
as the leader of his country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement sang highly of Nyerere's contribution to the
victory over colonism, to the building of his nation, to the
struggle against apartheid, and to the contemporary quest for
peace in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The contribution and "his litany of accomplishments" "touch
everyone on the African continent," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere died in a London hospital on Thursday aged 77. He was
diagnosed with chronic leukaemia last year and admitted to St.
Thomas's Hospital in London last month. He went into intensive
care on October 1, suffered a major stroke last week and died at
0730 GMT on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Mourns Death of Tanzanian Ex-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Thursday sent a message of condolence to the government and
people of Tanzania over the death of its founding president Julius
Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
In the message to Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, Mugabe
said that Tanzania and the rest of the world had lost a great man.
</P>
<P>
The history of Zimbabwe and southern Africa would be incomplete
without a chapter on Nyerere's "the revolutionary, visionary,
principled, indomitable and unyielding supporter of our own and
the region's independence," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe would remain indebted to Nyerere and the people of
Tanzania for their contribution to its independence, he added.
</P>
<P>
"That candle can never be extinguished and will remain his
eternal legacy," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere died of leukemia at the age of 77 in a London hospital
on Thursday morning.

OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy expressed regret Thursday at the rejection of the United
States Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The world "can only be deeply disturbed by this turn of
events," Axworthy said, adding "Canada, the United States and the
rest of the world will be much more secure with the CTBT than
without it."
</P>
<P>
He also urged the U.S. Senate to reconsider its decision on the
CTBT in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The treaty fell 19 votes short of the required 67 for
ratification, with 48 senators in favour, 51 against and one
abstention.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Mourns for Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Thursday sent a message of condolence to the government
and people of Tanzania on the death of former Tanzanian president
Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
In the message to Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, Museveni
referred to Nyerere as a statesman who had made a most outstanding
contribution not only to the people of Tanzania, but also to the
people of Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"By supporting the anti-colonial movement in southern Africa
and by supporting the people of Uganda against the dictatorship of
Idi Amin during his tenure of office, Nyerere made a most
outstanding contribution to the liberation of approximately 100
million people," Museveni said in a press release issued here by
the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
He assured Mkapa that the people of Uganda will never forget
the fact that almost single-handedly, Nyerere shouldered the
burden of fighting the black dictator Idi Amin.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was hailed as almost the only president in Africa who
ignored the erroneous argument of the pseudo-sovereignty of states
that was used to cover up the genocide unleashed by Idi Amin on
the people of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The present economic and political recovery of Uganda would not
have been possible without that invaluable contribution of the
former Tanzanian leader.
</P>
<P>
To show Ugandan people's heartfelt sorrow and sadness, Museveni
 announced that all the national flags in the country would be
flown at half- mast until Nyerere's remains have been buried at a
date to be announced by the Tanzanian government.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who had been suffering from leukemia, passed away at
the age of 77 at a London hospital on Thursday morning.

<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today during a meeting with the prime minister of Mali that China
is willing to expand cooperation with Mali in various areas to
make the China-Mali relations more robust than ever in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the pledge to Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who arrived
here Wednesday morning on a six-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
Mali was the first African country that established diplomatic
relations with China. Jiang and Malian President Alpha Oumar
Konare exchanged visits in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 39 years of diplomatic relations, Jiang said, the
friendship between the two has grown steadily and healthily.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the cooperation in political, economic, cultural,
educational and medical areas have been fruitful, and the
friendship between the two peoples have increased with time, Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China appreciates the Malian Government's consistent
"one China" policy, and has been grateful for the valuable support
of Mali on the human rights issue and other major international
issues.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Try to Set Refugee Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPERE, Finland, October 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
leaders will gather here on Friday to hold a two-day special
summit in bid to harmonize the 15 member states' immigration and
asylum policies among others for years to come.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders at the justice and home affairs council will
focus on various projects including a common visa system, stricter
EU external border controls, more police cooperation, a
European-wide immigrant fingerprinting database and coordinated
rejection of asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
In the past, a lack of trust between EU governments has often
hampered efforts to get agreement on common justice and home
affair rules. Even while the leaders look for harmonized tone in
Tampere to try to discourage as many as people as possible from
seeking asylum within the EU borders, they will still face the
problem of what to do with those people who are allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
For years, those EU members which have traditionally received
large number of refugees, led by Germany, have called for the EU
to put in place a system to "share out" asylum seekers more evenly
between the 15 EU countries. However, it is always a hard
question.
</P>
<P>
Data shows that a decade of anti-immigration measures, such as
visas, fines on airlines, reduced welfare, detention and
deportation, have done little to halt thousands of people seeking
a safe livelihood in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Some ten years ago, 308,040 asylum seekers arrived in Europe.
It was 334,230 in 1998. In fact, blocking access and making life
unberable for asylum seekers did not stop hundreds of thousands of
Yugoslavs, Afghans, Somalis, Angolans, Sri Lankans, Iraqis,
Iranians, Kurds and others. They often claim that they suffered a
second round of persecution inside the European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
However, current EU president Finland has expressed their
resolve to take the opportunity in Tampere to "develop the Union
as an area of freedom, security and justice in the next
millennium, acting in a responsible and influential manner at the
global level".

DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister
Tony Blair has expressed condolences on the passing away of
Tanzania's founding president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
In a message of condolence to the government of Tanzania, Blair
praised the role Nyerere played in making peace both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"He (Nyerere) was a leading African statesman of his time and
the founder of modern Tanzania," the British leader said. "The
fact that Tanzania is today a country at peace with itself and its
neighbors is in large part a tribute to 'Mwalimu' Nyerere."
</P>
<P>
British Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,
Peter Hain, said upon arrival in Dar es Salaam on Thursday morning
that Nyerere was a " grandfather to modern Africa, loved and
respected by the whole continent and the international community."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere died of leukemia at the age of 77 in the St. Thomas'
Hospital in London on Thursday morning.

<P>
NICOSIA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Two top civil servants in
Cyprus' Immigration Department were suspended from services
Thursday pending investigations for illegal supply of temporary
residence and work permits to foreigner.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, Cyprus' Interior Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou said that in a letter Wednesday,
Police Chief Andreas Angelides asked for the suspension of
Christodoulos Nicolaides and Nicos Vakanas of their services in
Immigration Department.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said the suspensions will be in force for three
months, unless police investigations are concluded earlier.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Angelides said that preliminary investigations
have shown that the two might be involved in cases concerning the
supply of illegal temporary residence and employment permits.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary at the Interior Ministry, Andreas
Panagiotou, will temporarily replace Nicolaides.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police last week launched an emergency probe into
allegations that police officers are involved in flesh-trading
and are being paid to supply fake residence permits for foreign
women in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has acquired a bad reputation for importing female
cabaret dancers who are then allegely forced to work as
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Angelides has vowed that any officers found guilty of
involvement in the alleged scandal would face the full penalty
under law.

ADDIS ABABA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negaso
Gidada Thursday sent message of condolences to his Tanzanian
counterpart Benjamin Mkapa over the passing away of former
Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said that Negaso expressed his
deep grief on behalf of the people and government of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian president said in his message that Africa has
lost a great leader and a great human being.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere did not belong to Tanzanians alone. "As a true, wise
and proud Pan-Africanist, he belonged to us all," said Negaso.
</P>
<P>
The struggle he waged, both for political emancipation and
later for economic liberation was on behalf of Africa and of all
those who were denied justice, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania's loss is therefore our loss, and its grief our
grief," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi also sent message of
condolences to Tanzanian President Mkapa over the death of
Nyerere, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said.

In a cable of condolence sent to Tanzanian President Benjamin

<HEADLINE> Talks Fail to Make Zimbabwean Doctors Back to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The two-day meeting between the
striking doctors and parliamentarians of Zimbabwe failed to yield
positive results on Thursday as the doctors laughed off
persuasions to return to work.
</P>
<P>
The doctors thanked the members of parliament for their efforts
in mediating but told them, "Regrettably the doctors' general
meeting resolved to continue the industrial action because the
minimum demands have not been met."
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the Hospital Doctors Association Tatenda
Mawire said the doctors wanted a written statement resolving their
grievances as a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Speaker of Parliament Edna Madzongwe said the
Parliamentarians had tried their best to find the solution as they
were concerned with the health situation in their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
She said, "We have not lost hope, we are still going to see
what we can do to pressure for a bigger portion for the Health
Ministry when the budget is announced next Thursday."
</P>
<P>
"People are now tired of burying their relatives. Our interest
is to see them going back to work and we will keep on persuading,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The doctors went on strike three weeks ago and vowed to
continue until their demands for salary and allowance increase
were met.
</P>
<P>
The strike had paralyzed the country's health delivery system
with patients being turned away and wards attendants were
instructed not to admit new cases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association said in a
statement that the government should put the health of the
citizens above everything.
</P>
<P>
"Before the doctors went on strike people were dying of curable
diseases because of the unavailability of drugs. Today they are

<HEADLINE> French PM Hails Merger of French and German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin hailed on Thursday the planned merger between the French
aerospace group Aerospatiale-Matra with its German counterpart
DASA as a triumph of European construction.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in Strasbourg, Jospin said that the future Franco-German
aerospace group, European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Company
(EADS), will be one ``powerful tool for the construction of a
strong and unifying Europe mastering fully its future.''
</P>
<P>
He also said that the success of the rapprochement between the
two countries' aerospace industries shows the ``irreplaceable role
of the Franco-German cooperation as the locomotive of European
construction.''
</P>
<P>
Aerospatiale-Matra and DASA announced on Thursday that they
planned to merge in the first half of 2000 to create Europe's
number one aerospace company and the world's third largest with an
annual sales of 21 billion euros (22.6 billion U.S. dollars) and a
work force of 89,000.
</P>
<P>
The move is apparently aimed at strengthening Europe's stand in
the world aerospace and defense market which is dominated by the
United States companies such as Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also called on other European Union (EU) partners to
``join as soon as possible this demarche'' by allying with the new
group, which he said ``has the vocation to facilitate the tie-up''
with aerospace industries of all EU countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Jacques Chirac was delighted to know
this agreement, which ``fully inscribes itself in the perspective
of a European defense under construction.''
</P>
<P>
``Faced with the constitution of international groups of very
great dimension, notably in America, it should become a key move
to ally European forces,'' said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the future group will have its shareholders
mainly based in Europe and would be ``given the means for
ambitious strategic and industrial projects and for creating
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
Jospin said that the merge will strengthen the development of
the Airbus, ``which will find a new push to embrace the challenge
of tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
Aerospatiale-Matra and DASA are the main shareholders of Airbus
consortium, with the British Aerospace and the Spanish aerospace
group CASA being their partners.
</P>
<P>
The French government will hold 15 percent of the shares of the
future EADS group, while the Lagardere group, which is the owner
of Matra, will hold 11 percent and unidentified French share
holders 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
DASA will hold another 30 percent, while the remaining 40
percent of the shares will circulate in stock markets.

<HEADLINE> Pak Military Govt Rejected to Commonwealth Summit: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's military
government would not be allowed to attend next month's
Commonwealth summit in Durban, South African President Thabo Mbeki
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association quoted Mbeki as telling
journalists in Cape Town that Commonwealth secretary-general Emeka
Anyaoku had yet to approach him about the matter.
</P>
<P>
However, the Commonwealth took a decision when it met in
Zimbabwe in 1991 that the organization itself was committed to,
and should defend, democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
It was on that basis that Nigeria, in the aftermath of the
executions of Ken Saro Wiwa and other Ogoni activists, was
suspended from the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine for the Commonwealth to be consistent in its
views, clearly, I don't think it would allow that a military
government should be represented at the forthcoming heads of
government," Mbeki said in reply to whether Pakistan would be
suspended.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was deposed in a
bloodless military coup on Tuesday after he tried to axe army
chief General Perven Musharraf.

<HEADLINE> Africa Must Recommit to Peace to Honor Nyerere: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki said Thursday that the best way to pay tribute to
African statesman and late Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere was
for the continent's people to re-commit themselves to the cause of
peace, stability and a better life for all.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki described Nyerere's death as loss for the "continent of
Africa as a whole", South African Press Association (SAPA) said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was a pillar of strength to oppressed people all over
the world and was admired for his wisdom, his intellect and
integrity, Mbeki was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere served as a source of great inspiration to efforts
towards Africa's rebirth.
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the wise sons of Africa who guided our journey
towards placing Africa in her rightful place in the world."
</P>
<P>
At the height of his career, Nyerere had dedicated himself to
the upliftment of his people and remained committed to justice and
equality.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the national flag would fly at half mast countrywide
from Friday to Tuesday in memory of Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
On whether he would attend Nyerere's funeral or send a
representative, Mbeki said: "Hopefully there will not be an
engagement, here or elsewhere, which would make it difficult for
us to attend. It would be a very good thing if the president of
South Africa could attend."

<HEADLINE> Britain Says No Formal Chile Request to Free Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday it was
not true that it had received a formal request from Chile for the
release of detained former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet on
humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
"It's completely untrue," a Reuters report quoted a Home Office
spokeswoman as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the Home Office confirmed that Chilean President Eduardo
Frei had sent a confidential letter to Prime Minister Tony Blair
last week, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"The Chilean president sent a letter to the prime minister last
week on October 7, but it was confidential and we cannot comment
on its contents," the Home Office spokeswoman said in tehr report.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Foreign Minister Juan Gabriel Valdes told a Chilean
radio station on Thursday that a document had been handed in to
Britain's Home Office, formally asking Home Secretary Jack Straw
to let Pinochet go on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
Chile's government has long argued that Britain should release
Pinochet and stop the extradition sought by Spain.
</P>
<P>
Pinoceht, 83, was house-arrested in October of last year in a
London hospital while he was recovering from a minor back
operation.
</P>
<P>
A Spainish judge accused him torture in the latter part of his
1973-1990 rule and wanted to try him in Spain.
</P>
<P>
A Britaish court ruled out last week that Pinochet should be
extradited to Spain to face the charges. Pinochet was not in the
court to hear the ruling, as required by British law, because of
his frail health and old age.
</P>
<P>
The former commander-in-chief of Chile's army is currently
under house arrest in a hired mansion in the south-west suburb of
London. His lawyers had lodged an appeal to a higher Britain
court. He is expected to keep on fighting against the extradition
proceedings.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is concerned and disappointed at the decision by the
United States Senate not to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT), the Foreign Ministry said in a statement
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It (The South African government) believes that this
development undermines the gains already achieved by the
international community in nuclear non-proliferation and
disarmament," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria had hoped that the U.S. Senate would achieve
bipartisan consensus to enable the White House to ratify this
Treaty and join the international community in reinforcing both
the legal force and moral authority of the CTBT, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the U.S. Senate to reconsider its view.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the only country in the world which acquired
nuclear capacity but later destroyed it.

ADDIS ABABA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Airlines
(EAL) announced Thursday that it will open new flight routes to
Maputo, Mozambique, and Copenhagen, Denmark, as of next month.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned EAL will fly to Maputo initially on a
twice-weekly basis, an EAL press release said.

<P>
The opening up of the Maputo route is yet another example of
Ethiopian's commitment to air transport development within Africa,
the statement said.

The statement said that with two flights a week to Copenhagen,
the EAL establishes its first direct link between Africa and
Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
The EAL has started a twice-weekly direct flight to Zanzibar,
Tanzania, on July 28 this year.  During the past year, the EAL
opened flights to Tel Aviv of Israel, Beirut of Lebanon,
Washington and New York and Bahrain while resuming flight to
Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Car-makers Pioneer Cleaner Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to further reduce
vehicle emissions, the big three U.S. automakers in Canada are
pioneering cleaner fuels in part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ford Canada Ltd., GM Canada and DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc.
Thursday launched the joint program by announcing their
designation of pumps selling cleaner-burning fuels with an "Auto
Makers' Choice" logo.
</P>
<P>
The automakers said "cleaner cars need cleaner fuels to operate
properly and obtain maximum emissions reductions," even though
emissions from cars and trucks made by the big three have "reduced
by up to 99 percent from uncontrolled levels."
</P>
<P>
The automakers will forge a partnership with Atlantic Canada's
largest gasoline retailer Irving Oil to provide cleaner fuels on
the east coast, Quebec and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The new fuels contain lower sulphur content and fewer fuel
additives, which are harmful to the pollution control equipment
fixed in the vehicles made by the three companies, the automakers
say.
</P>
<P>
"If all vehicles on the road in Canada today could access Auto
Makers' Choice gasoline, it would be the equivalent of eliminating
the smog-causing emissions from almost two million cars and light
trucks," according to Maureen Kempston Darkes, president of GM
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The automakers also asked other oil companies to follow suit in
making cleaner fuels for consumers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Presses for Resumption of Cyprus Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Presidential Envoy
to Cyprus Alfred Moses Thursday held talks with Turkish leaders in
a bid to outline a formula for the resumption of the deadlocked
Cyprus talks.
</P>
<P>
Moses met with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, discussing
ways of resolving the longstanding Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
Turkey maintains a 35,000-member troop in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and the international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the island through a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation formula, but the peace talks between the two sides have
been stalled since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the staunch supporter of Turkish Cypriots, who
proclaimed a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in
1983 that is recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Moses' visit is seen as a follow-up to the discussion between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Ecevit in September, which created
an atmosphere of relative optimism that a negotiation formula
satisfactory to the Turkish side could be outlined.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Ecevit, Moses said that they had
had "a friendly and constructive" discussion.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that Moses' efforts were aimed at
outlining a formula that would bring Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Denktash rejects face-to-face talks as long as he is not
granted political status equal to that of Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Ankara was Moses' first leg of a three-nation trip and he will
travel on to Greece and Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Two RAF Aircrew Killed in Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Two RAF aircrew were killed when
their Tornado GR1 jet crashed in a remote farmland on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plane, on a routine training flight from RAF Lossiemouth in
Scotland, came down between Ingoe and Kirkheaton, about 16
kilometers from Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses described how the unarmed aircraft veered from its
course and exploded in a "horrendous fireball" 500 yards from farm
buildings.
</P>
<P>
A RAF spokesman said only one aircraft had been involved in the
accident although eyewitnesses reported seeing a light aircraft
flying very low in the area seconds before the Tornado came over.
</P>
<P>
RAF Communications Officer Tony Parrini said: "As far as we
know at this time, there were no other aircraft in the vicinity
and there was certainly only one aircraft involved in this
incident. The aircraft was not carrying any weaponry at the time
of the incident."
</P>
<P>
But Gale Brown, 37, who lives about 500 meters from the crash
scene, described seeing another plane in the area.
</P>
<P>
"A few seconds before the RAF aircraft came over there was a
little passenger plane which came over, very low indeed," she
said. "I was giving a riding lesson at the time and was warning
the rider to get ready to steady the horse with the noise.
</P>
<P>
"We get jets over all the time, but the little passenger plane
was like a stranger in the camp. It looked like a 10-seater
aircraft with windows down the side. The next thing we saw were
two RAF aircraft come over, and then one of them come down," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Republicans for Nuke Treaty Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday blasted the Senate's rejection of the nuclear test ban
treaty as "partisanship at its worst."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the East Room of the White
House, Clinton said the vote revealed a "new isolationism" from
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
"In recent days, members of the congressional majority have
displayed a reckless partisanship that threatens America's
economic well-being and now, our national security," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Even more troubling are the signs of a new isolationism among
some of the opponents of the treaty," he added, citing the refusal
of the Republicans to pay the U.S. debt to the United Nations and
refusal to adopt proposals to stem tide of global warming.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated that the U.S. will continue to retain its
moratorium on nuclear weapons test and will support the nuclear
test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to pursue the fight against the spread of
nuclear weapons. And we will not -- we will not -- abandon the
commitments inherent in the treaty and resume testing ourselves.
I will not let yesterday's partisanship stand as our final word on
the Test Ban Treaty," Clinton noted.
</P>
<P>
On a largely party line vote, the Senate defeated the treaty
late Wednesday by 51-48. The United States thus became the first
nuclear power to specifically reject the treaty on ending nuclear
weapons testing.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in 1996
and has been signed by 154 countries. Clinton signed the treaty
in 1996 and sent it to the Senate for ratification in September,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The pact will not take effect until it is ratified by all the
44 member countries of the Geneva-based Conference on Disarmament.
It has been ratified by 26 countries.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Successful JMC Meeting on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday extended his welcome to the successful holding
of the first full meeting of the Joint Military Commission (JMC)
in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, on October 11-12.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in a statement issued here by his spokesman, said, "He
is encouraged that the representatives of the parties to the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have extended in
writing guarantees of security for United Nations personnel and
property to be deployed in the DRC (Democratic Republic of
Congo)."
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations looks forward to working with them towards
the restoration of peace in that country," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The delicate peace process in Congo (K) was boosted this week
when the warring parties met and agreed on basic measures to help
prevent a new round of fighting.
</P>
<P>
The participating representatives gave formal security
guarantees for U.N. peacekeepers who will monitor compliance with
the peace deal and made substantial progress on defining the
territory controlled by each of the forces and the number of
troops they have on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"The security guarantees given at Kampala will allow the United
Nations to proceed with the deployment of Military Liaison
Officers and civilian personnel to rear and field headquarters in
the DRC, and the early dispatch of a Technical Survey Team which
will review conditions on the ground," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan reiterated his support for the efforts by the
Organization of African Unity to help implement the Lusaka
ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
Annan highly commended the Governments of South Africa, Uganda
and Zambia for "their generous contributions in cash and in kind
to the functioning of the Joint Military Commission," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to present a report on the issue to the U.N.
Security Council on the enlarged presence in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that subject to authorization by the Security
Council, this will lead to the deployment of a United Nations
peacekeeping operation," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The war broke out in Congo (K) in August 1998 and sucked at
least five other African nations, with Uganda and Rwanda backing
rebel groups and Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia all supporting
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
A team of 90 U.N. observers is to prepare the ground for the
deployment of a 500-strong peacekeeping force, but its deployment
in the conflict zones had been delayed because of continuing
insecurity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Rise Slightly in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose just
0.1 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted 253.4 billion
U.S. dollars, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The September increase, slightly worse than expected, followed
a revised 1.5 percent gain in August. But total retail sales have
held steady most months of this year and were 10.5 percent higher
than September of last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said last month's performance may be a sign that the
Federal Reserve's two interest rate increases are beginning to
slow consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The consumer sector is being supported by the lowest
unemployment rate in nearly three decades, a 4.2 percent level
that has given more workers cash to spend.
</P>
<P>
Overall retail sales were held back by a 1.3 percent decline in
sales of new cars and trucks by automobile dealerships in
September. That followed a strong 3.1 percent increase the month
before. The auto industry is anticipating a record sales year in
1999.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales rose a
brisk 0.6 percent in September. Many analysts were expecting a 0.5
percent gain.
</P>
<P>
Last month, sales at apparel and accessory stores dropped 0.9
percent following a 1.2 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
Also, sales at hardware and building supply stores were down
0.6 percent in September despite Hurricane Floyd, which raked the
East Coast last month. That category, which also includes mobile
home dealers, posted a 0.4 percent gain in August.
</P>
<P>
However, the report showed that sales at furniture and home
furnishing stores posted a solid 1.2 percent increase in September
after a 0.7 percent gain in August.
</P>
<P>
The biggest gain in September came from sales at gasoline
stations, which were up 2.4 percent reflecting rising energy
prices. That followed a 2.7 percent rise in August.
</P>
<P>
The nation's biggest retailers last week reported that sales
rose modestly in September as the robust U.S. economy continued to
encourage shoppers to spend despite volatility in the stock market,
rising interest rates and the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Thursday, the Labor Department said that
the number of U.S. people filing for jobless benefits last week
dropped by an unexpected 29,000 to 285,000 as the jobs market
bounced back after the effects of the hurricane. Economists
believe that jobless claims levels under 300,000 are an indication
of an extremely tight labor market.

said Phillip Okundi, Managing Director of the national standards
body, in a message observing the World Standards Day Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, standardization began with the birth of Kenya Bureau
of Standards in 1974. Over the past years, the bureau has
developed more than 2, 000 Kenyan standards with the participation
of technical experts from both public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
To promote the standardization, the bureau has invested heavily
in the necessary human and infrastructural needs to provide
assistance to manufacturers and service industry for offering
quality goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The bureau as Kenya's standards flag bearer has introduced a
certification marking scheme nationwide to encourage
standardization in industry. Manufacturers whose products meet
the Kenya standards are issued with permits to use the
standardization mark.
</P>
<P>
Okundi said his bureau now operates the Diamond Mark of
Quality, a guarantee of product quality to consumers, adding that
firms with proven quality record are issued with permits to use
the Diamond Mark after a series of stringent quality assessments
by the bureau.
</P>
<P>
To date, 78 firms in the country have been issued with permits
to use the Diamond Mark of Quality on their products, which is
recognized in the two East African sister states of Uganda and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
In the next millennium, Okundi said, his bureau is under
obligation to enhance Kenya's industrial and commercial
competitiveness through promoting of metrology, establishment and
use of standards, testing and quality management.
</P>
<P>
He called upon all Kenyans to join the rest of world in
utilizing standards as the key tools for staying abreast of
technology-driven business development, especially in globalized
free trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
Kenya should put the issues of human safety, environment and
national economy at the forefront to facilitate the development
of standards faster in order to meet the emerging market needs,
Okundi added.

MAPUTO, October 14 (Xinhua) - The average Mozambican women
bears 5.9 children in her life, according to statistics from the
1997 census released in Maputo this week.
</P>
<P>
This figure is already 13 percent lower than that in 1980

</P>
<P>
 Some 29 percent girls aged between 15 and 19 have become
mothers in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons for the high fecundity is that most
Mozambicans both men and women want large families.

<HEADLINE> Turkey: New Era in Turco-EU Ties to Be Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said on Thursday that the
thorny ties between Turkey and the European Union can enter "a new
era" if Ankara's candidacy of EU membership is officially approved
at the Helsinki Summit in December.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Turkish Foreign Ministry in the day said
Turkey has once more been declared a candidate for EU full
membership in a recent report of the EU Commission.
</P>
<P>
"If all the recommendations of the commission are approved at
the EU summit in Helsinki, that is if Turkey is granted an
official candidate status with all its components, a new era will
be opened in the relations between Turkey and the European Union,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has said that the report
is "encouraging" and constitutes "a positive development"
following his meeting with President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the report is not binding and that
"we should wait for the outcome of the Helsinki Summit."
</P>
<P>
In a press conference here on Thursday, EU Commission
Representative in Ankara Karen Fogg played down speculation that
despite its present positive approach, the EU will obstruct
Turkey accession process, putting forward new conditions in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Fogg said that speculation on a timetable for the start of
accession talks can be very dangerous, stressing that Turkey
itself has asserted that it will not consider it a discrimination
if its accession talks do not start simultaneously with the other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
During the summit in Luxembourg in December 1997, the EU
decided to invite Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Slovenia and Cyprus to start accession talks in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Five other nations -- Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and
Slovakia -- were put on a slower negotiating track by the
15-nation union. And Turkey, a 34-year applicant, was left
completely in the cold.
</P>
<P>
The result of the summit was disappointing for Turkey, but "it
was not an obsession for Turkey and we will not treat it as an
event that will have an impact on the course of Turkey," said
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem at that time. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Declares 30 Days of Mourning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Thursday announced that his nation will mourn 30
days for the death of the former head of state Julius Nyerere who
died of leukemia earlier in the day in a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
With all flags lowered to half-mast for 30 days and all sports
or cultural activities suspended indefinitely, the grief-stricken
Tanzanians are eagerly waiting for the arrival of their founding
father's body.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi, with Mkapa as the National
Chairman, will hold a special meeting Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government has not decided where or when the
funeral will take place, but President Mkapa announced on national
TV that the father of the nation will be given all respects he
deserves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British government has offered a special plane
to transport the body of Nyerere to Dar es Salaam, BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
It said special prayer for Nyerere is scheduled to take place
at the Westminster Cathedral in London, and all well wishes and
Tanzanians living in Britain and neighboring countries will have a
chance to pay their last respects to Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city, Deputy Chairman of opposition Tanzanian
Labor Party (TLP), Augustine Mrema, said that he hoped that
Tanzanians would forget their political, ideological and religious
and even tribal differences during the mourning period.
</P>
<P>
"We should foster national unity in this difficult time just as
Mwalimu himself was a man of unity in all his lifetime," he said,
adding that "we expect that people would not use the death of the
Father of the Nation for the benefit of their political parties,
religions and social settings."
</P>
<P>
Several workers of the Tanzania Standard Newspapers (TSN),
publishers of Daily News, sobbed an wiped tears as the
announcement was made exactly at mid-day by President Mkapa, who
was flanked by Vice-President Omar Ali Juma and Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye.
</P>
<P>
Condolence messages started to pour in and many official
engagements were postponed following the death of Nyerere, who was
admitted to the St. Thomas' Hospital on September 24 and was in
and out of coma before died at 0730GMT Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, addressed as Mwalimu or "teacher" throughout Africa,
was respected for his intellect and integrity. He retired as
president in 1985 after 24 years of office.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Jamaica has become the first
country to receive emergency financing under an Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) line of credit to assist Latin American and
the Caribbean countries in preparing for computer problems related
to the year 2000, the bank announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A loan of 10 million U.S. dollars will assist an ongoing
Jamaican government effort to ensure that critical systems within
priority areas are Y2K compliant and to develop contingency plans
for systems that are not fully compliant and may be affected by
failures at the end of the century, the IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The resources will strengthen the government's program of
converting and renovating systems, testing converted systems, as
well as contingency planning and development of fall-back
activities to address possible systems failures and defects.
</P>
<P>
The IDB emergency loan is for a five-year term, with a
three-year grace period, at a variable interest rate of 4
percentage point above the six-month U.S. dollar Libor rate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the IDB declared the Y2K computer problem a
"technological emergency" and opened a 200-million-dollar line of
credit to assist countries of the region in preparing and adapting
their informatics systems to year 2000 requirements and in
preparing contingency plans to manage and cope with systems
failures that might occur after December 31, 1999.

<HEADLINE> No Multilateral Talks Before Syrian-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Thursday reiterated that
the multilateral talks, as part of the Middle East peace process,
should not be resumed until all bilateral peace negotiations,
especially on the Syrian track, are restarted.
</P>
<P>
If the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace negotiations
"witnessed a resumption and progress, then the multilateral talks
could likewise see progress," Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks after meeting with visiting
U.S. Secretary of Commerce William Daley, who arrived here
Wednesday on a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
"We are no die-hard rejectionists," Moussa said, explaining
that the agreed land-for-peace principle and the drive for
reconciliation are "the crux of the matter."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have got
back on track early September with the signing of the Sharm
el-Sheikh Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
But talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks on the return of
Syria's Golan Heights and Israeli troops' withdrawal from south
Lebanon have been stalled since 1996 after hardline Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war
and carved out a border zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak's election as Israeli prime minister in May
rekindled hope for realization of comprehensive peace in the
region because he pledged to make peace with Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He has fulfilled his promises to some extent by reviving the
peace drive with the Palestinians. But there have been no notable
signs so far for the resumption of talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral talks, kicked off in 1992, were designed to
tackle issues such as disarmament, water, Palestinian refugees,
the environment and economic cooperation, but they came to a halt
in 1996 after Netanyahu came to office.
</P>
<P>
Daley is on a regional tour, which has taken him to Jordan, the
Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel, and he will travel on to
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Mourns Death of Tanzanian Founder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- African leaders have sent their
 condolences on Thursday to the late founding father of Tanzania
Julius Nyerere, saying Africa has lost a great leader and a great
man.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, former president of Tanzania from 1964 to 1985, died
of blood cancer leukemia in a London hospital on Thursday morning
at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere did not belong to Tanzanians alone, "As a true, wise
and proud Pan-Africanist, he belonged to us all," said Ethiopian
President Negaso Gidada.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said that the history of
Zimbabwe and southern Africa would be incomplete without a chapter
on Nyerere's " revolutionary, visionary, principled, indomitable
and unyielding support of our own and the region's independence".
</P>
<P>
"That candle can never be extinguished and will remain his
eternal legacy," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahmed Salim spoke highly of Nyerere, one of the founders of
the OAU.
</P>
<P>
"His tireless crusade for liberation, and the leadership he
gave to the struggle as president of Tanzania and Chairman of the
Frontline States, was substantial in the defeat of colonialism and
apartheid,"
</P>
<P>
"Africa has lost an ardent advocate of its unity and
indefatigable defender of the freedom and dignity of its people,"
Salim said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said, "By supporting the
anti-colonial movement in southern Africa and by supporting the
people of Uganda against the dictatorship of Idi Amin during his
tenure of office, Nyerere made a most outstanding contribution to
the liberation of approximately 100 million people."
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said Tanzania, east Africa and
the entire continent had lost a selfless son and a statesman who
dedicated his life to the cause of African dignity.
</P>
<P>
South African President Thabo Mbeki said Nyerere was a pillar
of strength to oppressed people all over the world and served as a
source of great inspiration to efforts towards Africa's rebirth.
</P>
<P>
"He was one of the wise sons of Africa who guided our journey
towards placing Africa in her rightful place in the world."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said the best way to pay tribute to Nyerere was for the
African people to re-commit themselves to the cause of peace,
stability and a better life for all.
</P>
<P>
Some African countries will fly their national flags at half
mast to mourn for the death of Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a message of condolences to
his Tanzanian counterpart Benjamin Mkapa, praising Nyerere for his
contribution to the friendlh at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"He was a leading African statesman of his time and the
founder of Modern Tanzania," Blair said. "The fact that Tanzania
is today a country at peace with itself and its neighbors is in
large part a tribute to 'Mwalimu' (teacher) Nyerere."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: France, Germany Merge Aerospace, Defense Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany announced
Thursday in Strasbourg that the French aerospace and defense group
Aerospatiale-Matra and its German counterpart DASA will merge in
the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The merger, which is the first of such scale in Europe in the
aerospace and defense field, also signals the acceleration of a
process of building a single European aeronautics, defense and
space industry.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder announced the merger plan in the eastern French
city to show their firm support to the consolidation of the
European aerospace and defense industries, which they consider to
be the key to the construction of European defense.
</P>
<P>
The future merged group, European Aeronautic Defense and Space
Company (EADS), will be the world's third largest aerospace group
after the U.S. Boeing-McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed-Martin and
will have an annual sale of 21 billion euros (22.6 billion U.S.
dollars) and a work force of 89,000.
</P>
<P>
It will be headed by Jean-Luc Lagardere, president of the
council of supervision of the Aerospatiale-Matra, and Manfred
Bischoff, president of DADA.
</P>
<P>
The merger also opens the way for alliance with other European
aerospace and defense groups, including the Spanish CASA and the
British Aerospace, which are partners in the Airbus consortium,
the most important component of EADS.
</P>
<P>
Based in Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, EADS will be the
world's second largest group in civil aviation after Boeing, the
first in helicopter making and satellite launching, and the second
largest in missile and satellite making after the U.S. Raytheon
and Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Jospin said that EADS will be a powerful
tool for building a strong and unifying Europe who is the master
of its own future.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Schroeder said that the Franco-German
alliance will push forward the construction of an independent
military force in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The merger will put an end to three years of disagreement
between Aerospatiale and DASA, which failed to strike a deal on
merging the missile and satellite parts of their groups in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It will also pave the way for the building of an independent
Airbus group which will ally with the British Aerospace and
Spanish CASA.
</P>
<P>
The future EADS will have 80 percent of the shares of Airbus,
while British Aerospace will have 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the building of a single Airbus group have
come into a deadlock for one year because of disputes over
powersharing between the four groups involved.

UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said it signed an agreement with
Indonesia Thursday on the free access to refugees across West
Timor where some 230,000 East Timorese are camped.

<HEADLINE> Russian Spokesman: Moscow-NATO Ties Remain Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that its
ties with NATO remain frozen and Moscow is not taking part in any
joint activities with NATO aside from the peacekeeping operations
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The readiness of NATO to better take into account Russia's
interests and concerns regarding fundamental European and
international security issues may become a prerequisite for the
unfreezing of relations between Russia and NATO," Russian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry's statement came in response to "recent
attempts by representatives of various NATO structures to increase
contacts with Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's ties with NATO was frozen following the beginning of
NATO air raids on Yugoslavia on March 24. All contacts with NATO
have since been halted other than consultations on the
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia has 3,600 troops in the Yugoslav province as part of 40,
000 multinational peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that another condition would be the
willingness of the alliance to strictly observe the understandings
in the framework of the Russia-NATO Founding Act.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has taken notice of the statement concerning the need
to improve NATO-Russia relations made by the alliance's new
Secretary General George Robertson shortly after his appointment,
Rakhmanin said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned Over U.S. Refusal to Nuclear Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Thursday voiced
serious concern over the refusal by the U.S. Senate to ratify the
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, saying it marked a
worrisome trend in U.S. activities recently.
</P>
<P>
Moscow is "disillusioned and seriously concerned" about the
Senate's decision, which "deals a serious blow to the whole system
of agreements in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation, especially as far as the non-proliferation treaty
is concerned," Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 51-48 Wednesday to throw out the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). More than 150 countries have
signed the deal but it cannot go into force unless all 44 nuclear-
capable states, including the United States, ratify it.
</P>
<P>
"What causes deep concern is the quite definite trend that can
be seen in U.S. activities of late," the Interfax news agency
quoted Rakhmanin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Along with its decision not to ratify the test ban treaty, the
U.S. has adopted a new law on ABM defense systems, issued new
threats about export controls and taken other steps that "
destabilize the foundations of international relations", the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it was the U.S. that took "the most active part"
in the preparation of the CTBT and was also the first country to
sign it, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, U.S. President Bill Clinton's
statement that Washington will keep to its moratorium on nuclear
tests, which is being observed by all five nuclear powers, did not
pass unnoticed by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Moscow, sticking to the treaty, "regards it
as its duty to take into consideration the consequences of the (
Senate's) decision on the treaty for security and safety all over
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry also blasted the Senate decision,
saying it set "a dangerous precedent with far-reaching
consequences."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the decision "may cause an imbalance in the
entire system of control over the nonproliferation of nuclear arms
and nuclear technologies," Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Palestine to Enhance Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday agreed to
enhance bilateral cooperation to boost the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reached the agreement during a 25-minute
meeting at the Japanese prime minister's official residence, a
Japanese government official said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi reiterated his commitment to "extending economic
assistance and playing a political role...given the importance of
Palestinian stability and prosperity in moving forward the Mideast
peace process," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here earlier in the day to attend a two-day
meeting of donors to Palestinian, thanked Obuchi for Japan's
economic assistance and other contributions for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also revealed his decision to open an
office in Japan. Palestinians had a representative office in Tokyo
under the Palestine Liberation Organization, but closed it in June
1995 due to financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese official said Obuchi hailed Arafat for his "
tenacious" efforts in the peace process, and expressed the hope
that both Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will
continue to lead "negotiations toward an agreed target of
realizing a final agreement in September 2000."
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Obuchi that he is "optimistic," and reiterated the
Palestinian authority holds the right to declare independence next
year, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Ships Allowed to Enter Yugoslav Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A Romanian convoy consisting
of 12 ships entered Yugoslavia's territorial waters this week, the
local daily newspaper Curentul quoted the director of the Drobeta
NFR River Navigation Company Dumitru Vidoe as saying.
</P>
<P>
They are the first Romanian cargo ships to enter the Yugoslav
territory since the Kosovo conflict broke out.
</P>
<P>
The convoy bound for Novi Sad to load grain in the Romanian
Black Seaport of Constanta.
</P>
<P>
Romanian shipowners and river operators blocked the Danube
River in August to draw the attention of the Yugoslav and Romanian
authorities to the difficulties the naval companies were facing,
which were caused by the delay of restoring traffic on the river.
</P>
<P>
Romanian river fleet operations have sunk into a poor state
after NATO's airstrikes destroyed three bridges in Yugoslavia,
blocking the traffic on the Danube in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Romanian naval companies registered huge losses from the
blockage, since almost 85 percent of the Romanian river
commodities freights are bound for Hungary, Austria and Germany
through the Yugoslav Danube River's waters. Millions of tonnes of
goods from and to Central Europe piled up in the Romanian ports by
the Danube and the Constanta Port.
</P>
<P>
Romania has the largest river fleet in Europe, with 1,100 non-
propelled vessels of 1,000-3,000 tonnes and over 180 tugboats of
500-4,600 horse power. International river traffic contributes 75
percent to the Romanian river's fleet capacity.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Expects U.S. Senate to Change Position on CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Thursday voiced hope
that the Republican-controlled United States Senate could
reconsider and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"We expect the issue will be discussed again in the United
States in consideration of the atmosphere of global support for
the CTBT," the South Korean Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea hopes the U.S. Senate's rejection of the treaty is
not the final position of the United States, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope the United States, which has played a leading
role in the global non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and arms
reduction, will continue to do so," added the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, South Korea ratified the treaty, which is
aimed at curbing the spread of nuclear weapons by banning the
detonation of nuclear bombs underground, at sea, in the atmosphere,
and in space.
</P>
<P>
In a roll call vote Wednesday, the U.S. Senate failed to ratify
the treaty by a 51 to 48 vote. The Clinton government signed the
treaty in 1996 and sent it to the Senate for ratification in
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Explaining its decision, the Senate said a total ban on nuclear
tests would undermine the U.S. ability to upgrade nuclear weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was approved by the U.N. General Assembly in 1996 and
has been signed by 154 countries. It will take effect when it is
approved by all 44 member nations of the Geneva-based Conference
on Disarmament. To date, 26 states have ratified it.

<HEADLINE> WTO to Order Canada, US to Scrap Unfair Auto Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (
WTO) is siding with Japan and the European Union to ask Canada and
the United States to scrap their 34-year old auto pact.
</P>
<P>
Canadian media reported Thursday that the WTO believes the pact
to be preventive and unfair against foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, which was first disclosed Wednesday, will take its
final form in about a month. Canada would have to get rid of the
pact within 90 days if the ruling were finalized at the time.
</P>
<P>
The final WTO rulings rarely deviate from interim decisions,
according to the country's media reports.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the U.S. forged the auto pact in 1965. Under the
deal, General Motors of Canada Ltd., Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd.
and DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc. are required to build as many cars
in Canada as they sell.
</P>
<P>
The big three U.S. automakers in return are exempted from
paying a duty when they import cars for sales in Canada from
anywhere else in the world.

<HEADLINE> Two Japanese City Banks Announce Merger Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank,
two of Japan's major commercial banks, announced an agreement
Thursday to form a broad-based alliance by April 2002 to create
the world's second largest bank.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached a basic agreement on business integration,
which we assume will be achieved by April 2002," Sakura Bank
President Akishige Okuda said in a joint press conference with
Sumitomo Bank President Yoshifumi Nishikawa.
</P>
<P>
"The new bank intends to be one of the world's top commercial
banks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two have combined assets of 99 trillion yen (about 820
billion dollars), second only to the one to be formed by a planned
alliance among Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), Fuji Bank and the
Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo and Sakura's announcement came one week after Asahi
Bank and Tokai Bank said they would set up a joint holding company
in October 2000.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March 2000, the end of the current business year
for both banks, Sumitomo and Sakura will own shares in each other,
the two banks said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of full integration, the banks will form a partnership in
some areas of retail and wholesale banking, and in international
services, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two banks plan to close 151 domestic outlets and 32 offices
abroad by March 2002 and will trim 9,300 jobs by March 2004, they
announced.
</P>
<P>
They also said nonperforming loans, a major factor behind the
banking industry shakeup, will be put to an end by March 2002.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Bank, based in Osaka, western Japan, has 51.5 trillion
yen (about 428 billion dollars) in assets with about 15,000
employees, while Tokyo-based Sakura Bank has 47.2 trillion yen (
about 392 billion dollars) in assets with a workforce of 16,300.
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank have acted as the chief source of
funds for Japan's two major competing corporate groups-- Sumitomo
and Mitsui.

<HEADLINE> German, Swedish FMs Disappointed at U.S. Senate's Rejection of CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from
Germany and Sweden, Joschka Fischer and Anna Lindh, said here
today that they were deeply disappointed at a U.S. Senate decision
to reject the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (
CTBT), a global pact targeted at ending nuclear tests worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate decision represents a serious setback for
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and is therefore a wrong
signal, said the foreign ministers in a joint statement, adding
that they "deeply regret" the rejection.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers expressed the hope that President Clinton and
his administration would find a way to make the United States a
full supporter of the CTBT, and called on other nations across the
world to continue with their efforts of disarmament and nuclear
non-proliferation, which include the signing and ratification of
the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived in Stockholm on Wednesday for a two-day visit
at the invitation of the Swedish government. He is to hold talks
with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov later on Thursday. The
two will reportedly focus on the situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said at a press conference here that Germany believes
the conflict in Chechnya can be settled only through dialogue, and
the European Union and the United States is concerned about the
current fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, sources within the German Foreign Ministry earlier
ruled out any possibility that Fischer would, on behalf of the
western nations, present a special proposal on the resolution of
the Chechnya issue to the Russian side.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Send Joint Team to Georgia for U.N. Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece decided Thursday to send
a joint diplomatic and military team to Georgia to assist in
negotiations for the release of five U.N. observers kidnapped by
unknown gunmen in the breakaway region of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Deputy Defense Minister Dimitris Apostolakis said
Thursday that the Greek team would leave Thursday for Georgia with
the aim of ensuring that no harm comes to the U.N. observers,
including a Greek officer, whose name is George Kopanos, an
artillery captain.
</P>
<P>
Apostolakis said that Greece had asked the Georgian government
to be informed in advance about any plans it may have to try and
release the observers by force.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Nikos Athanasakis said at
a press briefing that Greece hoped force should not be used to try
and release the observers.
</P>
<P>
The observers from Greece, Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden and the
Czech Republic were reportedly kidnapped by nine gunmen 75
kilometers northeast of Sukhumi together with their Russian
interpreter after their helicopter came under fire Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou Wednesday condemned
the kidnapping and said that Greece were watching this matter
closely.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Rise Slightly in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose just
0.1 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted 253.4 billion U.
S. dollars, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The September increase, slightly worse than expected, followed
a revised 1.5 percent gain in August. But total retail sales have
held steady most months of this year and were 10.5 percent higher
than September of last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said last month's performance may be a sign that the
Federal Reserve's two interest rate increases are beginning to
slow consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
The consumer sector is being supported by the lowest
unemployment rate in nearly three decades, a 4.2 percent level
that has given more workers cash to spend.
</P>
<P>
Overall retail sales were held back by a 1.3 decline in sales
of new cars and trucks by automobile dealerships in September.
That followed a strong 3.1 percent increase the month before. The
auto industry is anticipating a record sales year in 1999.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales rose a
brisk 0.6 percent in September. Many analysts were expecting a 0.5
percent gain.
</P>
<P>
Last month, sales at apparel and accessory stores dropped 0.9
percent following a 1.2 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
Also, sales at hardware and building supply stores were down 0.
6 percent in September despite Hurricane Floyd, which raked the
East Coast last month. That category, which also includes mobile
home dealers, posted a 0.4 percent gain in August.
</P>
<P>
However, the report showed that sales at furniture and home
furnishing stores posted a solid 1.2 percent increase in September
after 0.7 percent gain in August.
</P>
<P>
The biggest gain in September came from sales at gasoline
stations, which were up 2.4 percent reflecting rising energy
prices. That followed a 2.7 percent rise in August.
</P>
<P>
The nation's biggest retailers last week reported that sales
rose modestly in September as the robust U.S. economy continued to
encourage shoppers to spend despite volatility in the stock market,
rising interest rates and the hurricane.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Criticizes U.S. Senate's Rejection of CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greenpeace organization in
Greece Thursday criticized the U.S. Senate's vote opposing the
ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on
nuclear weapons, saying the decision has "torpedoed" international
efforts to ban nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Thursday, Greenpeace said the U.S.
Senate has begun a new cycle of "nuclear terrorism" and given the
green light to other countries with nuclear capability to ignore
the world's desire for a definitive end to the "nuclear nightmare.
"
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace Campaign Director Nikos Haralambidis said the U.S.
refusal to ratify entails the collapse of the treaty, which has to
date been signed by 154 countries.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Thursday sent a message of condolences to his Tanzanian
counterpart Benjamin Mkapa mourning the death of founder of the
east African nation Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "I am shocked to learn the unfortunate death of H.E.
Julius Kambarage Nyerere, former President of your esteemed
country.
</P>
<P>
At this sad moment, I wish to express, on behalf of the Chinese

who enjoys high respect of your people and is a statesman and
international activist widely renowned in Africa and the world at
large," Jiang remarked.
</P>
<P>
"He has dedicated his whole life to the great cause of
independence and progress of Tanzania and the African continent,
and has played an important role in the promotion of South-South
Co-operation and South-North Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"As one of the founders of Sino-Tanzanian friendship, Mwalimu
Nyerere has made precious contributions to the maintenance and

death has resulted a loss of a longstanding friend of the Chinese
people, whom we greatly regret and feel sorry for," the Chinese
President said in the message.
</P>
<P>
Jiang added,"I herewith have the honor to express my
willingness to join Your Excellency in our concerted efforts to

relations and co-operation that were created and nurtured jointly

<HEADLINE> Abacha's Son Charged with Murder in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The son of Nigeria's late
military ruler Sani Abacha Thursday was charged with murdering
late President- elect Moshood Abiola's wife at a court in Lagos,
Nigeria's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Abacha, 29, was charged alongside General Sani
Abacha's security chief, Major Hamza al-Mustapha, and three other
security officials.
</P>
<P>
The court in its first session refused to accept an application
from the defendants for bail and decided to adjourn the case until
mid- November.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people watched junior Abacha and his father's
colleagues walking into the courtroom with seemingly calm and
relaxation.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Abiola was shot dead in a Lagos street in June 1996, three
years after his husband won a general election and claimed himself
 the president.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha seized power and jailed Moshood Abiola after
the election was annulled by the military. Abiola died in prison
from a heart attack, a month after General Abacha himself died.
</P>
<P>
Major al-Mustapha and another accused, Lieutenant-Colonel
Ibrahim Yakassai, also face murder charges over the death in
prison in 1997 of Major-General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, who was
deputy to current President Olusegun Obasanjo when he was a
military ruler from 1976 to 1979. Both Yar' Adua and Obasanjo were
jailed by Abacha in 1995 for allegedly plotting against his
regime.

<HEADLINE> Chissano Pays Homage to Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano on Thursday evening said in a radio address that the late
former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere was a friend of his
country in difficult times.
</P>
<P>
Chissano described Nyerere as his country's first friend and
Tanzania led by Nyerere as "the cradle of freedom and
independence" of his country.
</P>
<P>
In 1962, Nyerere sponsored the founding of the Mozambique
Liberation Front (FRELIMO) in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said Nyerere had been "always at our side, in our
difficult moments, and in our moments of celebration".
</P>
<P>
"Nyerere was present in the support for our struggle against
the destabilization and aggression we suffered from the racist and
minority regimes of Rhodesia and South Africa, and their allies
and agents," Chissano said in his condolence message.
</P>
<P>
Chissano praised Nyerere's role as the first chairman of the
Front Line states, "whose decisive role led to the total
liberation of the peoples of southern Africa from colonial and
racist rule".
</P>
<P>
In recent years Nyerere had continued his work "for peace and
freedom in Africa, and was leading the current process for
pacification in Burundi".
</P>
<P>
 The best way to pay homage to Nyerere, he concluded, was "to
restate our firm commitment to cooperation between the Mozambican
and Tanzanian peoples and states".
</P>
<P>
Nyerere died of leukemia in a London hospital Thursday
morning. He is to lie in state in London's Westminster Abbey on
Saturday before his body is flown back to Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Franco-German Locomotive at Work Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- After experiencing 10 months of
lukewarm relations, France and Germany are again finding
themselves playing the joint role of a locomotive pulling forward
the train of Europe's political, economic and defense integration.
</P>
<P>
By putting together the strategically key aerospace and defense
industries, Paris and Berlin are renewing their relations of
mutual trust and returning to the same bed after a deviation by
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder in trying to woo the British lady.
</P>
<P>
The merger between Aerospatiale-Matra and DASA is a decisive
step by Europe in allying its aerospace and defense industries to
get free from the dominance from an all-powerful United States.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the historic plan in Strasbourg, French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin invited all the European partners of France
and Germany to join the "demarche" as soon as possible, which he
said is aimed at quickening the building of a European defense.
</P>
<P>
He said that the merger is a big step in the integration of
Europe's civil and military aeronautic industries and is the fruit
of a common political will of the governments of France and
Germany to reinforce their industrial and defense ties.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that the merger itself will serve as a
locomotive for Europe and will allow it to fare better in the
global competition, especially facing the other side of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Germany has been criticized for having not
made cooperative ties with France strong enough.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Germany came into trouble when the
German government announced last winter that it would abandon its
nuclear industry, which is closely linked with France's nuclear
processing plants.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also disputed deeply about the financing of
the European Union institutions, with Germany intending to cut its
contributions and criticizing France for giving too little.
</P>
<P>
The French Socialist government was annoyed by a joint
manifesto co-signed in June by Schroeder and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on seeking the so-called "Third Way" of
neo-liberal social-democracy in Europe, about which the French
feel uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
But London's long prior strategy of sticking to an alliance
with the United States, including in the field of defense
industry, has maintained the distance between the European
continent and the British isles.
</P>
<P>
In September, Schroeder began to mend his ties with France by
inviting Jospin to Berlin and explained his understanding of
relations with France, which he said were of "an affair of heart."
</P>
<P>
The series of failure suffered by the Social Democrats in a
number of regional elections and the European election also taught
a lesson to Schroeder, forcing him to seek a change of his image
at home by turning left again.
</P>
<P>
As a minor sign of renewing alliance, Germany is also
supporting French opposition to the lifting of embargo on British
beef products by the European Union.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Thursday a loan of 400 million U.S. dollars in support of the Thai
government's efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of public sector services.
</P>
<P>
The Public Sector Reform Loan focuses on improvements in
revenue and expenditure management, human resource management,
decentralization, participation, transparency, and accountability,
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that recovery is swift and sustainable, Thailand has
to focus on improving competitiveness, encouraging the private
sector, strengthening governance, enhancing social justice and
protecting natural resources," said World Bank Thailand Country
Director Jayasankar Shivakumar.
</P>
<P>
"Had the importance of improving governance been recognized
earlier..., the current economic crisis could have been avoided,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to making the public sector more effective and
responsive, this reform program also helps Thailand achieve its
goal in alleviating poverty, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank loan is at the bank's standard interest rate
for Single Currency Loan-based U.S. dollar loans with a maturity
of 15 years, including a 3-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Political Situation Takes A Dramatic Turn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's political
situation has taken a dramatic turn early Friday as the army led
by coup leader General Pervaiz Musharraf declared the state of
emergency throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said that the state of emergency,
declared two days after the bloodless coup, came as the apparent
failure of hectic efforts to form an interim or a caretaker
government which deserves the army's trust.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf, who is also chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Committee and the Army Chief, is reported to have called a
meeting of corps commanders discussing the future plans Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement of the state of emergency in the country seems
to be the last option by the army under the present circumstances.
</P>
<P>
According to what the army called "A Provisional Constitution
Order" issued in the wee hours of Friday, the state of emergency
was enforced throughout Pakistan with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf has assumed the office of the Chief Executive
of Pakistan, and the whole of Pakistan shall come under the
control of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's constitution has been suspended and
the national and provincial assemblies have been dissolved, but
the president of Pakistan shall continue in office.
</P>
<P>
The order also announced the dismissal of the prime minister,
the federal ministers, the ministers of state, advisors to the
prime minister, parliamentary secretaries, the provincial
governors, the provincial chief ministers, the provincial
ministers and advisors to the chief ministers.
</P>
<P>
The order, however, did not mention the duration of the state
of emergency. It is still not clear whether this is a temporary
arrangement which will be followed by general polls.
</P>
<P>
Responses from various political parties and organizations are
still awaited.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the growing rift between the government and the
army over various issues of national importance, the army staged a
coup Tuesday evening which overthrew the 31-month-old government
of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Sharif first assumed his premiership in November 1990 and was
ousted from his office in April 1993. He was elected the top
executive of this south Asian nation in February 1997 with an
overwhelming mandate.
</P>
<P>
However, he failed again to complete the
constitutionally-stipulated five-year tenure of office.

Neville tore an abductor muscle in England's goalless draw last

MOSCOW -- Russia said Thursday that its ties with NATO remain

NATO aside from the peacekeeping operations in Kosovo.

"The readiness of NATO to better take into account Russia's

<HEADLINE> League and Sponsors Happy with Worthington Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Football League insist the
Worthington Cup is not being devalued by some teams' decision to
play with lesser-known players in their sides.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea all fielded relatively
unknown players in their third-round ties. But League director of
communications Peter Rowe is adamant the "vast majority" of teams
are playing at full strength.
</P>
<P>
He added that sponsors Bass Breweries are very pleased with the
competition. "We recognize that teams have squad systems in this
day and age, so we wouldn't necessarily term it as an under-
strength team," said Rowe.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly don't think the competition is being devalued.
When you look at some of the teams last night the vast majority of
clubs competing take the competition very seriously.
</P>
<P>
"There are a few clubs who operate a squad system, and we have
to adapt to that in modern football. But there were some great
games. We believe attendances are holding up - in the last round
attendances were up two percent, and that was a positive sign."
</P>
<P>
Rowe believes the promise of a UEFA Cup place for the winners
of the Worthington Cup has been another incentive for teams to
field their strongest sides. "There is an all-round increase in
the number of games, so we have to try and adapt and in doing that
we have reasonably well achieved it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For the majority of clubs it is a great opportunity for them
to get into Europe. Ask Tottenham - if it wasn't for this
competition they wouldn't be playing in Europe. So George Graham
would be a good person to ask about the pluses of winning the
Worthington Cup.
</P>
<P>
"The other benefit is the great legitimate distribution of
wealth. By using the cup we can distribute money to smaller clubs.
Bournemouth went to West Ham where there was a crowd of 22,000 and
they got 45 percent of the gate. That will help them enormously."
</P>
<P>
Punters and bookmakers, though, are upset by the policy of some
Premiership teams in the Worthington Cup. Bookies William Hill
believe under-strength sides in the competition have affected the
compilation of odds and punters' choices.
</P>
<P>
"Punters don't know whether the teams they are backing to win
individual games or the Cup itself are taking the competition
seriously, which discourages them from having a bet," said Hills
spokesman Graham Sharpe.

<HEADLINE> China's Tractors Sell Well in Off-Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China's tractors have sold
surprisingly well this July and August, the traditional off-season
for buying the vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the China Tractor Statistics Society indicate
that in July and August, the country produced more than 8,800
large and medium tractors, up 22 percent over the same period last
year, with the sale number soaring 27.8 percent to 9,770.
</P>
<P>
Insiders in the sector attribute the growth mainly to the fact
that tractors with 50 horsepower and above have been well received
in the market, and that the boom season has arrived earlier in
markets of Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong and Shaanxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
China's tractor production has maintained a steady growth
momentum this year. From January to August, 43,972 large and
medium tractors were manufactured, up 11.1 percent, and those with
over 50 horsepower jumped 26.6 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from 44 tractor makers show that in the first eight
months, these enterprises produced more than one million small
tractors, surging 16.1 percent in a year-on-year comparison.

<HEADLINE> Wales on Mark for New Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association of
Wales have decided they want Mark Hughes as their new manager -
but they won't admit it!
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night they would only announce that they had
decided who they want and would open negotiations with his club in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Bizarrely, the FAW were unwilling to actually name Mark Hughes
as their target, despite weeks of open discussion about the 35-
year-old's appointment.
</P>
<P>
Hughes is the man the FAW want after a full council meeting in
Cardiff decided on their target, and they will approach
Southampton for his services.
</P>
<P>
But the technicality of Hughes already being under contract to
the Saints stopped FAW secretary general David Collins officially
naming the former Manchester United legend after the meeting at a
Cardiff hotel.
</P>
<P>
But the key issue is that the FAW have decided who they want
and they have not considered delaying an approach, or considered
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
Southampton will be asked for their permission to approach the
man who has been caretaker boss of Wales for the past two matches,
and talks between Hughes, his advisors and the FAW will take place
over the next few days before a formal announcement is made.
</P>
<P>
Collins said after the meeting: "The FAW council has met and
decided to open negotiations with regard to a national team
manager, and following a successful conclusion of those talks we
hope to be able to make an announcement shortly.
</P>
<P>
"Those negotiations will take place over the next few days and
we hope to be able to announce the successful applicant.
</P>
<P>
"We will now be talking to the individual and the club
concerned, we need to talk to the chairman and to get his
permission to approach the player and take it from there. We will
be offering the player a contract to become our national team
manager," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad
on Thursday reshuffled the cabinet, moving Javier Espinoza from
the post of Secretary of State for Production to Secretary of
State for Economy, replacing Guillermo Lasso.
</P>
<P>
Lasso resigned two weeks ago reportedly because of his
disagreements with President Mahuad and former Finance Minister
Ana Lucia Armijos in the handling of Brady bonds.
</P>
<P>
On September 30, Ecuador became the first country to default on
Brady bonds, as it had been facing its worst economic crisis in
decades. But Lasso was opposed to a moratorium on the payment in
Brady bonds.
</P>
<P>
Brady bonds, named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, were created in 1989 to refinance the debt burden
of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Juaqn Falconi Puig was named as the new Secretary of State for
Production.

<HEADLINE> Return of Macao to End China's History of Humiliation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ma Kwok temple is the
oldest building in Macao and the place where Portuguese
colonialists first touched the ground of the island 446 years ago.
</P>
<P>
With the clicking of the clock nearing the new millennium,
Macao is also waiting for its return to the motherland, thus
ending China's humiliating history of foreign occupation of its
territory.
</P>
<P>
History records that Chinese have lived on this island for 6,
000 years, and when the Qin Dynasty united China in 212 B.C., it
was included as a part of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
In 1535, the Ming Dynasty moved its trade commission to Macao
to regulate monopolized foreign trade business there.
</P>
<P>
The 16th century was also the prime for Portugal's push toward
the global expansion of colonialism. After many of China's
coastal regions, the colonialists trained their eyes on Macao.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the armed robbery of Hong Kong by the British, the
Portuguese relied solely on fraud and bribery to take over Macao.
</P>
<P>
In 1553, some Portuguese pretended that their cargo ship had
hit rocks and asked for places in Macao to have their goods dried
in the sun.
</P>
<P>
With some bribery to local government officials, they obtained
permits to stay on the island, and much more followed to form
their own Portuguese town.
</P>
<P>
The central government of the Ming Dynasty still exercised
sovereignty rights over Macao, and along with collecting tax and
rents, it also garrisoned troops there and issued a law banning
piracy in the island.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said in Pristina on Thursday that Kosovo is not an
independent state but an autonomous province of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in capital city of Kosovo, Annan
said the U.N. Resolution 1244 has prescribed Kosovo as an
autonomous province within Yugoslavia. This expresses his clear
stance on the issue, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general, who arrived in Pristina Wednesday on a
two-day trip to the war-shattered province, expressed deep regrets
over the death of Valentin Krumov of Bulgaria, a U.N. staffer who
was killed Monday night by ethnic Albanian teenagers mistaking him
as a Serb.
</P>
<P>
He promised to take all possible measures to prevent the
reoccurrence of similar tragedies.

<HEADLINE> Return of Macao to End China's History of Humiliation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Opium War (1840-1842) brought China more than 100 years of
disgrace and humiliation. Emboldened by the fall of Chinese power,
the Portuguese colonialists instigated a series of crimes
violating China's territory: forcing the shut-down of Chinese
Customs, refusing to pay taxes and rent to the Chinese government,
levying taxes on Chinese people in Macao, and expelled Chinese
government agencies from the island.
</P>
<P>
In 1887, Portugal deployed military forces to take over Macao
and its nearby islands, and forced the government of the Qing
Dynasty to sign the unequal Sino-Portuguese Treaty of
Reconciliation and Trade to legitimize its occupation.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese struggles against this invasion and
colonialism have never ceased on the island, ranging from
demonstrations to the assassination of a Portuguese governor.
</P>
<P>
Chinese history began a new era when the People's Republic of
China was founded 50 years ago. The new government announced it
would never recognize the unequal treaties that the foreign powers
had forcibly imposed on China.
</P>
<P>
On April 13, 1987, the governments of China and Portugal signed
a joint declaration to confirm that the Chinese government would
resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Macao, which weathered all the hardships of Chinese history, is
about to embrace a new life.

TIRANA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Former police chief of Albania's

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislator Describes Visit to U.S. as Good Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The current visit to the
United States by the Chinese parliament delegation is a good start
for exchange of visits between the legislative bodies of the two
countries, a senior Chinese legislator said at a press conference
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, head of the delegation of the National People's
Congress (NPC) of China, said this visit has established channels
of communications and laid a good foundation for the future
exchanges and communications between the parliaments of China and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The NPC delegation arrived here Monday for a goodwill visit at
the invitation of the U.S.-Chinese Inter-parliamentary Exchange
Group of the U.S congress.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official invitation extended to a Chinese NPC
delegation from the U.S. congress in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the U.S. congress has established such an
exchange group and has decided to set up a relationship of
exchanges with the Chinese NPC shows the importance that the U.S.
congress attaches to its relations with the Chinese parliament,
Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, member of the NPC Standing Committee and chairman of the
NPC Foreign Affairs Committee, called for joint efforts to promote
mutual understanding and development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"The NPC, which also attaches great importance to its relations
with the U.S. congress, is ready to work with the U.S. parliament
to this end," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
He said the NPC delegation exchanged views with the U.S.
congress on the issues of common concern and bilateral relations "
in a friendly, cooperative, serious and frank atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
"Such talks have enhanced our mutual understanding and
increased our common ground," Zeng said, "we have become closer
and closer."
</P>
<P>
The two sides, though different on some issues, have reached an
agreement to promote the development of Sino-U.S. relations in a
sound and stable manner, Zeng noted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Direct Marketing Sales to Outpace Overall Sales Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The total direct marketing
sales in the United States will exceed 2 trillion U.S. dollars in
five years, continuously outpacing overall sales growth in the
country, a new study said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the U.S. Direct Marketing
Association (DMA), reveals that business-to-business direct
marketing sales are projected to comprise almost half of all
direct marketing sales by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1999, the direct marketing sales to consumers
in the country increased at a compound annual growth rate of 8.5
percent per year, compared to 5.5 percent annual growth in total U.
S. consumer sales.
</P>
<P>
Business-to-business sales increased 11 percent per year during
the period, versus a 5.6 percent annual growth rate in overall
business-to-business sales.
</P>
<P>
The total U.S. direct marketing sales grew from 970 billion
dollars in 1994 to estimated 1.53 trillion dollars this year. The
study forecast its total sales will reach 1.67 trillion dollars in
2000 and 2.34 trillion dollars by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Direct marketing is an interactive system of marketing that
uses one or more advertising media to effect a measurable response
at any location.
</P>
<P>
Direct mail, print advertising, catalogs, telephone, personal
computer, cable television as well as other media deliver the
information that is necessary for the consumer to make an informed
buying decision.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, direct response and spending will reach
176.5 billion dollars in 1999, comprising 57 percent of total U.S.
advertising expenditures of 309 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The growth in jobs attributed to direct marketing continues to
outpace overall U.S. employment growth, the study said.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, between 1999 and 2004, direct marketing
industry employment is expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.2
percent, more than four times of the overall U.S. annual
employment growth rate of 1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Reactions to Indonesian President's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie's accountability speech on Thursday night,
some politicians described it as pure rhetoric to gloss over the
failings of the administration, the Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his three-hour accountability speech before the plenary
session of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Habibie
devoted a great deal of his speech to elaborating on what his
administration has done to improve the economy, accelerate the
democratization process and carry out reform in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
He spoke at great length, defending his policy on East Timor,
which in late August voted to reject autonomy within Indonesia and
become a separate state.
</P>
<P>
"I hereby urge assembly members to ratify East Timor's
independence vote," Habibie said, pointing out that in various
international forums, Indonesia had always been cornered because
of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Amien Rais, chairman of the National Mandate Party, described
the speech as full of red marks, likening it to a school report.
</P>
<P>
He said credit should be given in areas of freedom of
expression, the release of political prisoners and the birth of a
multiparty system.
</P>
<P>
Amien, who is also chairman of the MPR, however said Habibie
did not fully elaborate on the critical issue of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Habibie in his speech defended a decision of the attorney
general to stop an investigation into alleged corruption by former
President Soeharto, saying, "There isn't enough evidence to prove
irregularities that caused losses to the economy or allowed an
abuse of power by Soeharto."
</P>
<P>
The president pledged to continue investigations into the
businesses of Soeharto's cronies and family members suspected of
collusion and nepotism and to deal with them according to laws.
</P>
<P>
Poll winner the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle chief
Megawati Soekarnoputri hinted that she would likely not approve of
it.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion the speech should be rejected, the reasons will
be presented later by the faction," she added.
</P>
<P>
Matori Abdul Djalil, chairman of the National Awakening Party
(PKB), said his party would likely reject Habibie's
accountability.
</P>
<P>
He said the speech was merely an apology for the wrongdoing or
shortcomings of Habibie's government. "It has yet to reflect the
reality," he added.
</P>
<P>
Declarator of the PKB Abdurrahman Wahid alias Gus Dur said that
he found at least two weaknesses in Habibie's speech and that
Habibie did not touch on the role of mass organizations in coping
with the nation's current problems.
</P>
<P>
Gus Dur, chairman of Indonesia's largest Islamic organization,
Nahdlatul Ulama, said the accountability speech only stressed the
mechanism of resolving the cases of corruption, collusion and
nepotism, but did not socialize the spirit of eliminating the
problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Golkar Party executive Marzuki Darusman said the
president had admitted that his administration failed in solving
human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
"In general, we wish to see the accountability accepted," he
added.
</P>
<P>
President of the Justice Party Nur Machmudi Nur Ismail said
there are many positive matters in the speech. The accountability
demonstrated the Habibie administration's bravery to confess past
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
All 11 factions in the MPR are scheduled to present their
responses to the speech on Friday and Saturday. Amien said there
will be a question and answer session before the assembly decides
to accept or reject the speech. If the MPR fails to reach a
consensus on the acceptance, a vote will be the only solution.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that if the speech is accepted it will help
smoothen Habibie's race for presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar Party has nominated Habibie as the party's candidate
for the October 20 presidential election and he is expected to run
against Megawati and Gus Dur.

<HEADLINE> Varied Habits of Education Savings: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given variations uncovered by the survey, there appears to be
no common approach in the Asia-Pacific region as to how much
parents saved for their children's education, said today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The differences could be attributed to different government
polices to promoted education, such as different kinds of
scholarships and students loans in those countries," said Feng
Weiquan, senior executive of MasterCard International.
</P>
<P>
Of the 600 people polled in China's major cities of Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou, two-thirds saved for their children's
education with monthly deposits reaching 100-200 yuan (about 12-24
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that pocket money for a child averaged 5
US dollars a week.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 per cent of Chinese parents give their children
allowances, an average of slightly below 50 yuan (6 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The poll found that 65 per cent of people 17 to 21 years old
have their own bank accounts. Most parents said they believe that
when young people reach the age of 17, they are capable of
handling their own money.
</P>
<P>
Twenty per cent of Chinese Mainland parents thought their
children are capable of handling their pocket money when they
reach 13, the survey reported.
</P>
<P>
From June 1 through June 21 the MasterCard International polled
5,453 people -- all 18 or older and all credit-card holders or
with the financial strength to be approved for credit cards.
</P>
<P>
The poll's respondents were from Australia, the Chinese
mainland, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Taiwan, India,
Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.

<P>
GENEVA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Martina Hingis dismissed
an American qualifier and the attention of an obsessive fan on
Thursday in the European Indoor tennis tournament in Zurich,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Tournament official confirmed they had found out a 42-year-old
Yugoslavian man in the audience, who admitted sending faxes to the

</P>
<P>

Second seed Venus Williams crushed Irina Spirlea of Romania 6-3,
6-2 to reach the quarter-finals.
</P>

<HEADLINE> NBA Lakers Star Bryant Breaks Hand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- NBA Los Angeles Lakers All-
Star guard Kobe Bryant has a fracture bone in his right hand and
will be sidelined for a minimum of six weeks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, forward-center Travis Knight will be out for three
to four weeks with a severely sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
The two suffered the injuries in Los Angeles' exhibition opener
Wednesday night against the Washington Wizards. They were
examined Thursday morning by Lakers team doctors.
</P>
<P>
Bryant, 21, has a fractured fourth metacarpal bone in his hand
and will be forced to wear a cast. He averaged 19.9 points, 5.3
rebounds and 3.8 assists last season for Los Angeles, which was
beaten by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in the Western
Conference semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the Lakers, they signed shooting guard Ron
Harper on Wednesday and his veteran presence should help offset
the loss of Bryant.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles opens its first season under new coach Phil Jackson
on November 2 at Utah.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Indiana Pacers teenager
forward Jonathan Bender suffered a broken wrist during his
professional debut Wednesday night and will miss 4-6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Bender, 18, fell after being fouled by fellow rookie Chris
Herron late in the fourth quarter of a preseason-opening 95-80
loss to Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
A high school star last year, Bender had one point and one
rebound in five minutes off the bench. He could miss a handful of
regular season games with the Pacers' opener set for November 2 in
New Jersey.

Bender was selected fifth overall in this year's draft by
Toronto and traded to Indiana for veteran forward-center Antonio
Davis.

<P>
Bender averaged 23.1 points, 15 rebounds, five blocked shots
and four assists as a high school senior. Last spring, he scored
31 points to break the McDonald's All-American Game record held by

<HEADLINE> Japan Concerned Over U.S. Rejection of CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan on Thursday expressed
concern over the U.S. Senate's veto over the ratification of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on nuclear weapons and urged
Washington not to undermine the global efforts to prevent the
spread of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about the immeasurable adverse effect on
global nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation ...and are
extremely disappointed with the situation given our expectations
of the U.S. leadership," Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Kono said Japan "strongly urges the United States to promptly
take measures not to undermine the credibility and significance of
the CTBT, which was created by the international society through
vast wisdom and energy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, survivors of the 1945 atomic attacks on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki denounced the U.S. Senate's rejection of the pact.
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry that the Senate rejected the CTBT, a worldwide issue,
only because of domestic political maneuvering," Kyodo News quoted
Sunao Tsuboi, a senior member of the Hiroshima Prefectural
Confederation of A-Bomb Suffers Organization, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hitoshi Hamasaki, an A-bomb survivor and leader of a survivors'
group in Nagasaki, was quoted as saying that the rejection could
lead the United States to develop nuclear weapons further.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate on Wednesday voted 51 to
48 to reject the ratification of the treaty. The rejection snubs
an international conference in Vienna which last Friday issued a
declaration urging the U.S. and Russia to ratify the treaty as an
example to other states that have signed but not yet ratified it.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was adopted at the U.N. General Assembly on September
24, 1996. The treaty stipulates that all 44 declared and potential
nuclear nations must ratify it for it to come into effect.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. to Further Border Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
will work together to improve border management and generate more
border trade, according to a joint statement released here
Thursday by the Canadian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will streamline border management, increase
customs efficiency as well as collaborate "on common threats from
outside Canada and the United States," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement hailed the world's longest undefended border as "
a model of cooperation and efficiency" and quoted U.S. President
Bill Clinton as saying during his last Friday's trip to Canada
that the progress was "excellent" since 1995, when he paid his
last visit to Ottawa and struck the Shared Border Accord with
Canada.
</P>
<P>
During Clinton's day-long visit, he and Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien confirmed the guiding principles for the border
management, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have agreed to establish the
Canada-U.S. Partnership, under which the two countries will hold
regular meetings for promoting border cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The cross-border trade between the two countries was reported
to top 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 678 million U.S. dollars)
last year, with a record of more than 200 million private border
crossings.

<HEADLINE> 2 die, 20,000 Families Displaced in S. Lankan Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- At least two persons died and
20,000 families were rendered homeless in floods resulting from
incessant thundershowers for over a week in Sri Lanka, officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Department of Social Services said the two
were killed in earth slips at Ayagama in the Ratnapura district in
southwestern Sri Lanka and the homeless families were mostly in
the coastal belt of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the Colombo district alone, around 10,000 families have been
displaced, local officials said, adding that the worst-affected
areas are along the western coastal belt, from Wennappuwa to
Puttalam.
</P>
<P>
Displaced families have been given refuge in schools and other
community halls and are provided cooked meals and dry rations. A
sum of 10,000 rupees (140 U.S. dollars) will be paid to each
homeless family.
</P>
<P>
The floods caused by rains have inundated many main roads and
by-roads in many parts of the country and many people were forced
to report to duty late or stay at home, officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Meteorological Department, Thursday's
thunderstorm and gusty winds and accompanying rains were due to
atmospheric disturbances over Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
It added that spells of heavy rain can be expected during the
current active monsoon season.

ZHENGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Scores of exquisite bone
flutes excavated from the Jiahu Relics Site in Central China's
Henan Province have recently been confirmed as the earliest wind
instruments in the world, according to archeologists.
</P>
<P>
The flutes are made of crane bones, and evidence of careful
construction and repeated tuning can be found on them.
</P>
<P>
The flutes, mostly with five to eight holes, sound seven notes,
which means that the ancient Chinese understood the seven-note
musical scale at least 8,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say that these flutes are the most complete
musical instruments among all those discovered worldwide which

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The price of soft drinks has
gone up by 17 percent in Zimbabwe this week, owing to the
escalating cost of inputs, the daily Herald reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Soft Drinks Manufacturers' Association Steve
Kuipa was quoted as saying Thursday that price increases are
inevitable if soft drinks manufacturers want to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen two price increases on sugar totalling 42
percent. Water has gone up by 70 percent and electricity has been
going up quarterly, totalling 55 percent since June this year," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in our input costs has seriously eroded the
profitability of the industry and has left us with no option but
to increase the prices of all our brands if we are to remain
viable and continue with our various investment programs into the
industry," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prices of soft drinks were last increased in June this year
following another upward rally in the price of key inputs.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Sign Bulls' Veteran Guard Ron Harper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Phil Jackson has succeeded
in bringing one of his former players to the Los Angeles Lakers on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have signed Ron Harper to a two-year, 4.2 million U.
S. dollars contract, re-uniting the veteran guard with the coach
for whom he helped win three NBA championships as a member of the
Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
A 13-year NBA veteran, the last five seasons spent as a member
of the Bulls, Harper owns career averages of 14.8 points, 4.3
rebounds and 4.0 assists. He averaged 11.2 points, 5.1 rebounds
and 3.3 assists during the 1999 campaign for the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased to add a player of Ron Harper's ability to our
team," said Lakers vice president of basketball operations Jerry
West.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to be here and happy to be a part of this great team
that is hopefully going to be even greater very soon," Harper said.
</P>
<P>
Harper started in the backcourt along with Michael Jordan as
the Bulls won titles in 1996, 1997 and 1998. Jordan retired
following the 1997-98 campaign and Jackson took a year off before
assuming control of the Lakers in June.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers suffered an 88-84 loss to the Washington Wizards in
their exhibition opener on Wednesday night as Jackson attempted to
install the triangle offense that allowed the Bulls to win six NBA
crowns this decade.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda to Unite Congo Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda are going to
help the opposing rebel groups of the Congolese Rally for
Democracy (RCD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to
form a joint liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
Officials from both countries who are trying to reconcile
themselves after the clashes in Kisangani in the DRC two months
ago made the promise at a joint press conference in Kigali
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's National Political Commissar James Wapakhabulo, who
led a six- man delegation to Kigali, told reporters after five-day
marathon talks with the Rwandan team that the joint liberation
movement would help the rebels achieve their objective in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Patriotic Front Secretary General Charles Murigande
said that supporting the two rebel factions has been a source of
contention between the two countries and having the two rebel
groups together would reduce the burden on both Uganda and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The RCD rebels split into two groups in May and Uganda and
Rwanda chose to support the Kisangani faction and Goma faction
respectively. The different stands the two countries have held on
the rebel groups constitute a direct cause to the recent clashes
in Kisangani between the armed forces of Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The clashes claimed more than 200 lives and both sides
sustained heavy material losses. Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame met in time to
prevent escalation of the clashes. The two former allies have
since resolved to mend the souring bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Suffers Heavy Losses for Delaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is losing between one to
two million U.S. dollars a month because of the delayed
privatization of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), Finance
and Economic Development Minister Katele Kalumba has said.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambia is on the threshold of economic development
because of its privatization program and a private sector driven
economy, the minister was quoted by Friday's Zambia Daily Mail
newspaper as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The economy has a sound foundation to provide good
opportunities for growth, he said, adding that the government has
over the last three months managed to bring the Structural
Adjustment Program back on course.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will continue to adhere to the cash
budget and strive to run domestic surpluses to eliminate overall
budget deficits, stressing that this would help the government to
save through financial systems and avail the surplus to the
private sector for investment.
</P>
<P>
The government has created a competitive environment for the
financial sector to operate in the country, the minister said,
citing the liberalization of interest rates, the complete removal
of exchange controls and the creation of the new Banking and
Financial Services Act as some of the measures put in place by the
government in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Massive Zimbabwean Dollar Devaluation Erodes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco, which is one of
Zimbabwe's largest foreign currency earners, has lost its glitter
owing to the massive depreciation of the local dollar, sending
fears of foreign currency shortages across the entire economy, the
daily Herald reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in earnings from 593.1 million U.S. dollars in 1996
to 334 million U.S. dollars this year has meant that pressure on
the foreign currency market would continue, making it difficult
for the authorities to continue to "manage" the Zimbabwean dollar,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, whose major strength is agriculture, is finding it
difficult to pull through the current economic depression,
particularly in view of the poor tobacco earnings.

<P>
The depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar by more than 50
percent since 1997 has chewed up tobacco earnings in U.S. dollar
terms, eroding the envisaged foreign currency inflows that were
supposed to shore up the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Profits that have accrued to farmers during the two-year period
were largely cosmetic because of the currency plunge and the high
inflation rate, which is now at 69.7 percent as of last month,
industry captains have said.
</P>
<P>
There has not been any significant monetary gain to farmers in
real terms, with the situation being made worse by the 10 percent
tobacco levy introduced by the government three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Capital's Main Street Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Sudirman street, the main
street in the Indonesian capital, was closed Friday following a
clash between students and security personnel on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Masses were still blocking the street through Friday noon. Cars
passing by Sudirman to Blok M area were forced to turn onto other
areas after the masses blocked the thoroughfare with a hijacked
public bus.
</P>
<P>
Another group of masses and students also blocked a road near
the Catholic University of Atmajaya which is not far from the
Semanggi cloverleaf with another hijacked bus.
</P>
<P>
Some shops in the areas along Sudirman street were closed.
Public buses plying the street were not operating on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clash between students and security personnel occurred on
Thursday night when President B.J. Habibie delivered his
accountability speech in the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 23 students, one policeman and one
journalist were injured. Some sustained serious wounds.
</P>
<P>
Many chanted slogans criticizing the president and demanded his
government reopen a corruption investigation against former
president Soeharto that was dropped this week without charging
him.
</P>
<P>
Others urged the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the
country's highest legislative body, to elect general chairman of
the poll winner the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle
(PDI-P) Megawati Soekarnoputri as the next president in the
October 20 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Megawati is expected to race against incumbent president
Habibie and the influential Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid, the
founder of the National Awakening Party.
</P>
<P>
The PDI-P finished first in the June election, but it failed to
win a majority in the 700-member MPR.

<HEADLINE> Family Planning in Central China Keeps Population Growth Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Henan Province in central
China, the country's most populous province with more than 93
million people, has had some 22 million fewer births over the past
25 years than what would have been the case without the country's
family planning policy.
</P>
<P>
Guo Guangyu, in charge of a survey concerning children below
the age of 16, said that their questionnaires in the province's
five areas show that the money needed to raise a child up to the
age of 16 is 24,000 yuan (about 1,680 U.S. dollars) in the rural
areas and 68,000 yuan in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The 22 million fewer people, therefore, has saved 117.8 billion
yuan, or 3.5 times that of the province's gross domestic product
for last year. This means a great deal to the province's
developing economy, and also contributed to the postponing of the
"World Day of Six Billion People."
</P>
<P>
The family planning policy of the past 25 years has reduced the
province's birthrate from 31.47 per thousand in 1973 to 14.17 per
thousand in 1998, and the population growth rate from 24.2 per
thousand to 7.8 per thousand, with the growth rate steadily
declining during this decade.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's controversial 8-4-4
education system is to be replaced with a new school program by
January 2001, according to a report submitted by the country's
Education Commission of Inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation reported Friday that Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi Thursday asked the Ministry of Education, Science and
Technology to appoint a task force to implement the proposals put
forward by the commission.
</P>
<P>
Details about the report were not available, but the commission
is believed to have called for changes to the 8-4-4 system, which
means eight years of primary school, four years of high school and
four years of university.
</P>
<P>
The current system, introduced 14 years ago, has been widely
criticized by parents and teachers for its heavy workload. It is
too broad, too expensive and too troublesome, they complained.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- A statement, issued by Turkish Foreign Ministry, said that
the thorny ties between Turkey and the European Union (EU) can
enter "a new era" if Ankara's candidacy of EU membership is
officially approved at the Helsinki Summit in December.
</P>
<P>
"If all the recommendations of the commission are approved at
the EU summit in Helsinki, that is if Turkey is granted an
official candidate status with all its components, a new era will
be opened in the relations between Turkey and the European Union,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Special Presidential Envoy in Cyprus Alfred Moses held
talks with Turkish leaders in a bid to outline a formula for the
resumption of the deadlocked Cyprus talks.
</P>
<P>
Moses' visit is seen as a follow-up to the discussion between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit in
September, which created an atmosphere of relative optimism that a
negotiation formula satisfactory to the Turkish side could be
outlined.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>

<HEADLINE> Olaru A New Star Shines at Gymnastics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Many predicted that new stars
would overshadow the veterans at the Tianjin gymnastics world
championships, and the shining Romanian fairies proved that was
not rash talk.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Olaru stole the limelight with impeccable
performance in the women's all-around final Thursday, and claimed
her first world glory.
</P>
<P>
"Am I really a world champion? I still can't believe it," said
the newly-crowned champion. Olaru edged pace-setter Vyctoria
Karpenko of Ukraine at the last apparatus to win the coveted title
with 38.774 points.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the history of the world gymnastics
championships that a debutante won the all-around title.
</P>
<P>
No one had listed Olaru a hot favorite for the title, comparing
with such big names as Olympic and world champions Svetlana
Khorkina of Russia and Simona Amanar of Romania.
</P>
<P>
Olaru, all-around silver medalist at last year's Goodwill Games
in New York, had a difficult time when she underwent a knee
operation last October and had to stop training for nearly four
months.
</P>
<P>
"She thought she would never be able to compete again. Once
she had returned to the gym, it became obvious that this incident
happened for a good reason as she was more motivated and she
worked even harder to regain her form," said Maria Bitang, Olaru's
coach.
</P>
<P>
Standing 1.62 meters as the tallest member of the Romanian team,
Olaru planted her name into everyone's heart when she led all the
way through the qualifying round and team final with almost
flawless routines.
</P>
<P>
While Khorkina and Amanar making mistakes in the breathtaking
final, Olaru surged from a temporary seventh place upwards and
finally topped the field after four rotations.
</P>
<P>
"I was more stable than anyone else today. It is as simple as
this," Olaru smiled after the victory. "But it was difficult and
boring when I prepared my routines for hundreds and thousands
times in the gymnasium."
</P>
<P>
"Now I am happy that I have done all these repetitions."
</P>
<P>
Octavian Bellu, head coach for Romania, echoed Olaru's words.
He said: "Maria was the most consistent in this competition, and
this is the explanation to her success."
</P>
<P>
Olaru, who started gymnastics training at the age of six,
wanted to join elite gymnasts like Khorkina, Amanar and Romania's
former world champion Gina Gogean.
</P>
<P>
"The younger are getting stronger and stronger and they have
reached the points where they are able to beat their idols," Bellu
said.
</P>
<P>
"This new generation are hungry for success and with the
Olympic Games approaching, they will be even hungrier to prove
themselves," added Bellu.

<HEADLINE> New Asset Management Firm Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The China Orient Asset
Management Corporation (COAMC) was officially established here
today, marking another solid step taken by China to handle non-
performing bank loans.
</P>
<P>
China plans to set up four capital asset management firms to
deal with the non-performing loans of its four state-owned
commercial banks. The first of these, China Cinda Asset Management
Corporation, was formed in April this year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the COAMC said that the new company is an
independent state-owned financial institution under the
supervision of the People's Bank of China, the country's central
bank.
</P>
<P>
With a total registered capital of 10 billion yuan, the COAMC
will mainly focus its business on managing non-performing loans
and assets transferred from the Bank of China, one of the four
state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The company also has access to trust accounts for other
financial institutions, and is also allowed to sell stock and
creditor rights to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The 10 billion yuan of capital will be allocated by the
Ministry of Finance, and includes six billion yuan and 500 million
U.S. dollars in foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
The president and vice-presidents of the COAMC will be
appointed by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the other two asset management corporations
are likely be established early next week.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Reports Better Industrial Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the leading industrial
center of north China, gained an industrial output value of 164.1
billion yuan in the first three quarters of this year, up 15.5
percent over the figure a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The sales rate for manufactured goods increased by one percent
to reach 97.6 percent in the first nine months, and profits of
paying concerns rose by 16 percent, while the amount of losses
incurred by deficit enterprises declined by 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
A municipal government official attributed the increased
industrial output to the development of new products and the
absorption of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city developed more than 2,000 new products
which contributed 22.5 percent to the city's total industrial
output value.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has given approval for foreign companies to form joint
ventures with 600 local state-owned enterprises, and this has led
to the influx of 4 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Move to Improve Sewage Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua)-- Three central government
departments issued a circular Thursday on strengthening the
collection of sewage treatment fees besides the regular charges
for water, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The circular, released by the State Development Planning
Commission, Ministry of Construction and State Environmental
Protection Administration, also urged local governments to build a
drainage and centralized sewage treatment system in cities.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qifeng, an official with the State Environmental
Protection Administration, said that the circular has guaranteed
funds for operating sewage treatment equipment, and will
contribute to environmental protection in China.
</P>
<P>
Only a few Chinese cities charge users the sewage treatment
fees, and the charges are often too low to make up for the cost of
operating and maintaining sewage treatment equipment.
</P>
<P>
Some users occasionally evade payment and embezzle public funds.
Some sewage treatment factories cannot even afford to operate the
equipment because of insufficient funds, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve the problem, the circular stipulates that
sewage treatment fees should be collected along with water fees
from users in all cities depending on the water used. In Beijing,
water consumers pay 0.3 yuan for each ton of water used.
</P>
<P>
The collected revenue will go towards sewage treatment
enterprises, which assume sole responsibility for their profits or
losses.

<HEADLINE> HK District Council Nominees Urged to Sign Up Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the
Registration and Electoral Office of Hong Kong reminded today
nominees intending to run in the District Councils election to
hand in their nomination forms as early as practicable before the
nomination period closes next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We would advise nominees not to hand in forms in the last
minute. They should allow leeway to rectify mistakes in the
entries on their forms and not to put themselves in the risk of
having their nomination being invalidated," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 640 people have already submitted nomination forms
in the past eight days since the two-week nomination period
started on October 7.
</P>
<P>
A total of 390 District Council members will be elected on
Sunday, November 28 to join 18 District Councils.
</P>
<P>
"Any registered elector aged 21 or above who has ordinarily
lived in Hong Kong for the three years immediately before the
nomination may join the race," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nominees must hand in their completed nomination forms in
person to the Returning Officer of the constituency they are
contesting and pay a deposit in the sum of 3,000 HK dollars (about
384 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Each nomination must be subscribed by at least 10 registered
electors in the constituency where the nominee is contesting. Each
elector is entitled to subscribe to only one nomination.
</P>
<P>
"Nominees should play safe and solicit the support of more than
10 subscribers in case some of the subscribers may be found
ineligible after validation by Returning Officers," the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> Up to 40% of Imported Goods in Russia Illegal:Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- About 30-40 percent of imported
goods in Russia are smuggled from abroad, causing great losses to
state customs earnings, said a top Russian customs official Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Vanin, chairman of the State Customs Committee (SCC),
told Izvesta daily that the SCC has collected 125 billion rubles (
around 5 billion U.S. dollars) in the first nine months of 1999,
well below the planned index because Russia's import was far less
than it had been predicted by the Economy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Russia forecast it was to import some 28 billion
dollars of goods this year, but actually, the imports will be only
21 billion dollars, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Vanin attributed the surge of illegal imports to the
ineffective implementation of tariff policies and the uncontrolled
influx of duty-free humanitarian aid.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPERE, FINLAND, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President and
Current European Union (EU) president Martti Ahtisaari expressed "
great regret" over the death of former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Finland and the European Union, Ahtisaari in a
statement expressed his "heartfelt condolences to the family of
Mwalimu Nyerere and the people of Tanzania on this sad moment of
their great loss," the Finnish news agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania has lost its founding father, a great leader and
teacher, whose spiritual legacy will remain a uniting force and
source of inspiration and stability in Tanzania," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere's advice was sought through decades also in regional
and international affairs, Ahtisaari said. "His demise is a
personal loss for me," added the Finnish president, who is here
attending a special EU summit.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, 77, died of chronic lymphocytic leukemia Thursday

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Has Great Potential for Economic Development: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region in northwest China, with its abundance of coal, petroleum,
and mineral resources, will very possibly become the focus of
China's development in the next century, said Dr. T.C. Tso, board
chairman of the Institute of International Development and
Education in Agriculture and Life Science (IDEALS).
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tso said at the ongoing International Symposium and
Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing Technology and
Industrialization in Shandong Province, that Xinjiang, if it can
solve the problem of water shortage, will very likely develop into
one of the country's main agricultural and industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
He made a comparison with California in the U.S., which has
similar conditions, saying that the west coast American state has
been able to grow into a developed area by channeling water from
the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
With his knowledge of southwestern China, including the Tibet
Autonomous Region, from his several visits, he thinks it possible
that China can channel water from the southwest, including
Tongtian and Jinsha rivers at the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River, the Lancang River, the Nujiang River and the Yalung Zangbo
River, into the Yellow River to solve water shortage problem in
the northwest.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country should also make good use of the
resources, especially water resources, in the west for its own
development, rather than totally rely on the east.
</P>
<P>
"When western China is able to depend on itself for further
economic growth, it will bring a bright future to the country's
agriculture and economy," said Dr. Tso with confidence.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, with about one-sixth of the country's total area, is
the largest province in China, while its population is only around
17 million, or some one percent of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> EDS: Updates with details, more infomration mee101503hke -- Israel Releases 151 Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel released Friday morning
151 Palestinian security prisoners under the Sharm el-Sheikh peace
deal signed in Septemer.
</P>
<P>
Buses loaded with the prisoners left Nafha prison near Mitzeh
Ramon and Shikma prison near Ashkelon at about 4:00 am local time
(0200 GMT) and traveled to different locations between Israel and
the Palestinian territories as agreed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 151 Palestinian prisoners were released from those
two prisons and others were selected from other lockups in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were handed over to the Palestinian side at
checkpoints near Tulkarm, Ramallah, Hebron and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Among the 151 prisoners being released, 44 were involved in
attacks that led to light injuries of Israeli citizens, 42 from
other Arab countries, 38 murdered suspected Arab collaborators with
Israel and others were imprisoned for various other offenses, Israel
said.
</P>
<P>
The list of the prisoners released Friday also included 10
members of the Islamic Militant Resistance Movement (Hamas) and
Islamic Jihad (freedom fighters) and five of them from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
This was the second group of Palestinian prisoners being released
by israel. Israel freed the first batch of 199 on September 9.
</P>
<P>
Friday's release came a week later than scheduled due to a
dispute between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators over the list of
prisoners. Israel refuses to free Palestinians who killed Israelis
or who were arrested for attacking Israelis after Israel and
Palestinians began signing interim peace accords in 1993.
</P>
<P>
For the Palestinians, the issue of the prisoners remaining in
Israel jails is one of the most sensitive and emotional in the peace
process - almost every Palestinian family has had at least one
member in an Israeli prison.
</P>
<P>
Mahane Ofer near Ramallah in the West Bank was one of the
crossings where the Palestinian prisoners were dropped, as a large
group of Palestinians were waiting to meet their beloved ones
coming home.
</P>
<P>
"I have been waiting for 15 years for my son to come home and
thank Allah my son is going out from Israeli jail today,"
61-year-old Aziz told Xinhua, while waiting for the buses loaded
with the prisoners to come.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner release is part of the implementation of the Sharm
el-Sheikh peace deal and Israel will free another group of
Palestinian prisoners by the end of the year ahead of the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan.

the middle of the next century, the annual per-capita consumption
of tea is expected to top one kilo, compared with the present 0.6
kg.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 tea experts from across the country attended the
seminar held in Guiyang, the provincial capital of Guizhou, in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
China is the original home of tea and one of the largest tea
producers in the world, with the country's tea plantation acreage
standing at 760,000 hectares, the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
During the 1993-95 period, China's tea industry was badly hurt
by the rapid expansion of other drinks, and saw its output plummet
by 50 percent to 400,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, tea has regained its reputation among
Chinese because of its healthy and nutritious qualities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China saw a notable recovery in tea production,
which topped 665,000 tons.

<HEADLINE>   Newcomers Call the Shots in World Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- It is a trend the veterans can
not beat that more and more newcomers are emerging out of their
shadow.
</P>
<P>
And the trend was underlined in the world gymnastics
championships here which saw favored veterans fell off one after
another and fresh faces came to the stage and put the color medals
to their credit.
</P>
<P>
Simona Amanar and Svetlana Khorkina were still impressive and
Alexei Nemov and Ivan Ivankov remained aggressive. But they had
been strongly feeling the pressure exerted by those who have honed
their techniques under their shadow.
</P>
<P>
Maria Olaru, 17, became the new queen of gymnastics as she beat
a strong field to finish 38.774 points to win the women's
individual all-round competition on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian is not alone as Vyctoria Karpenko of Ukraine, 18,
and Elena Zamolodchikova of Russia, 17, both outshone the more
experienced gymnasts to grab a place on the awarding podium.
</P>
<P>
It is a up-or-down matter as Amanar had to settle for a 14th
place and Khorkina only ended up 12th as their errors like falling
and shaking on the apparatuses cost them a lot.
</P>
<P>
Romania's legendary coach Octavian Bellu, who has guided his
women's "Dream Teams" to four straight world championships team
titles, exuded his joy to the emergence and maturity of the young
gymnasts while expressing respect to the old.
</P>
<P>
"This event also proved that a new wave gymnasts are coming
into the spotlight...the younger gymnasts were getting stronger
and stronger and they have reached the point where they are able
to beat their idols."
</P>
<P>
"This new generation are hungry for success and with the
Olympic Games approaching , they will be even hungrier to prove
themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I respect very much Khorkina and our Simona Amanar. Svetlana
started the competition with a hiccup on the beam and Simona
burned her out on her last piece, the Uneven Bars. But both have
contributed so much for their team -- fighting for so many years
and resisting constant pressure to win titles and events one after
another."
</P>
<P>
"Simona is now 20 years old and it is extremely hard to keep up
with the development of gymnastics at that age. Still she managed
to do this and she is a huge credit and support to our team."
</P>
<P>
The change in leadership also happened to the men's side as
world champion Ivankov and 1996 Atlanta champion Nemov are all
struggling with the an injury which kept them hot in preview but
cold in competition.
</P>
<P>
Ivankov, who has been poised to make history to become the
first three-time world champions in all-round competition with a
gold here, was forced to withdraw from the competition after
finished a 7.975 points in the horizontal bar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Injury had forced him to miss the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and
stopped him from making his mark again in the world championships.
</P>
<P>
Nemov also failed to became less aggressive as injury had kept
him from normal training and his routines' start value had dropped
before he finally came in sixth only at the competition.
</P>
<P>
While their shine dimmed the unknown young gymnasts flexed
their muscle and begun to call the shots.
</P>
<P>
Nikolay Krukov of Russia, Naoya Tsukahara of Japan and Jordan
Jovtchev of Bulgaria were the final three who smilingly waved the
flowers on the podium as the veterans lipped their wound nearby.

<HEADLINE> 49 Injured in Clash in Indonesian Capital: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 49 persons were
injured in a clash between students and security personnel in
Indonesian capital Thursday night, Police spokesman Brig. Gen.
Togar Sianipar told reporters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 49 injured, 11 were security personnel, four civilians
and 34 were demonstrators," he said, adding that at least eight
persons were arrested following the clash.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protesters returned to the streets as the second
round of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) general session
kicked off on Thursday night with the accountability speech of
President B.J. Habibie as its main agenda.
</P>
<P>
Many chanted slogans criticizing the president and demanded his
government reopen a corruption investigation against former
president Soeharto that was dropped this week without charging
him.
</P>
<P>
Masses were still blocking Sudirman street, Jakarta's main
street, through Friday noon.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the road blockade, traffic flow in Sudirman area
has virtually stopped and the traffic itself is in disorder.
</P>
<P>
At least three automobiles were heavily damaged or burned by
the masses.
</P>
<P>
Sianipar expressed the hope that until the end of the MPR
general session on October 21, the situation both in the capital
city and the regions will remain calm and called on the people to
trust the police and the security personnel in pacifying the
session.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the people to be wiser and not to be easily
provoked.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the spate of demonstrations, Chairman of the MPR
Amien Rais Friday expressed concern that Indonesia might turn into
a cold-blooded nation if bloody demonstrations become habitual.
</P>
<P>
"They (the bloody demonstrations) should be avoided," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest legislative body, will elect new
president on October 20 and new vice president on October 21.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent President Habibie, which was nominated by the Golkar
Party, is expected to race against General Chairman of the poll
winner the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P)
Megawati Soekarnoputri and the influential Muslim leader
Abdurrahman Wahid in the presidential election.

<P>
JINGJIANG (HUBEI Province), October 15 (Xinhua) -- An
embankment project on the Jingjiang dyke in central China's Hubei
Province, which utilizes steel pile anti-seepage technology for
the first in China, started today.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, 2.2 kilometers of anti-seepage wall will be
built in the Guanyinsi section of the Jingjiang dyke and the Yanwo
section of the Honghu dyke.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government provided nearly 1.5 billion Japanese
yen (about 117 million U.S. dollars) in aid for the project and
the Chinese side added some 40 million yuan (about 5.4 million
dollars) to get the project started.
</P>
<P>
The structure will enhance the anti-seepage quality of the two
sections, which are regarded as very important for preventing
floods along the Yangtze River, said a Chinese water resource
expert, adding that some 7.5 million local people will benefit
from the project.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that Japan provided six billion Japanese
yen of free aid to China last year. From 1981 to 1998, Japan
provided a total of 107.7 billion Japanese yen in free aid to
China, and this money has been mainly used for China's agriculture,

<HEADLINE> DPRK Disapproves of Multilateral Cooperation System in Northeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Foreign
Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said
here Thursday that the DPRK "disapproves of the construction of a
multilateral peace and cooperation system in Northeast Asia" and "
does not allow the Korea issue to become the topic of any
discussions."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the statement in an interview with the
Korean Central News Agency amid foreign media reports that the U.S.
, Japan and South Korea are planning to meet in Cheju-do in South
Korea later this month to discuss the establishment of a
multilateral peace and cooperation system in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that DPRK thinks it is too early to consider
establishing such a multilateral peace and cooperation system in
Northeast Asia, because there is no such a relationship between
the DPRK and some of its neighboring countries which can enable
them to cooperate with respect to issues of "national security".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in order to ease the tension on the Korean
Peninsula, the U.S. government must withdraw its troops from the
peninsula and sign peace agreements with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"The reunification of the Korean Peninsula is a matter of the
Korean people," the spokesman said, adding that the reunification
should be realized through peace talks between the two sides on
the Korean Peninsula independently.

<HEADLINE> Laos, U.S. Sign Anti-Narcotics Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Laos and the United States have
signed an agreement under which the U.S. government will
contribute 3.338 million U.S. dollars to the Lao government for
counter-narcotics activities, Lao official news agency KPL
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Chairman of the Lao National
Commission for Drug Control and Supervision (LCDC) Soubanh
Sritthirath and U.S. Charge d'Affaires to Laos Karen Stewart.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to stop mountainous area opium poppy
cultivation by helping farmers find other sources of income.
</P>
<P>
This U.S. funding will be used to complete construction of the
Sone Tay-Meuang Peu road, and to develop commercial silk
production and other activities.
</P>
<P>
Of the funding, 2.288 million dollars will be used in a
Lao-American Crop Control and Development Project in the districts
of Samphanh and Boun Tay in Phongsaly province. This will support
the Lao government policy of ending opium cultivation by building
rural infrastructure and supporting the development of alternative
sources of income and food security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 600,000 dollars will be used in the Lao-American
Crop Control and Development Project in the districts of
Viengthong and Houameuang of Houaphanh province.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 450,000 dollars are for continued support to the
counter-narcotics law enforcement units in Vientiane and the
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The LCDC and the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane recently signed an
amendment to the existing bilateral agreements between the two
countries on counter-narcotics cooperation. The amendment provides
72,500 dollars from the U.S. government to the Lao-U.S.
Cooperation Project in Houaphanh province.
</P>
<P>
KPL quoted a statement of the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane as
saying that the U.S. government is pleased to continue cooperation
with the Lao government to eliminate opium production and reduce
drug addiction and trafficking in Laos.

<HEADLINE> Israel Releases 151 Palestinian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel released Friday
morning 151 Palestinian security prisoners under the Sharm
el-Sheikh peace deal signed in September.
</P>
<P>
Buses loaded with the prisoners left Nafha prison near Mitzeh
Ramon and Shikma prison near Ashkelon at about 4:00 am local time
(0200 GMT) and traveled to different locations between Israel and
the Palestinian territories as agreed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 151 Palestinian prisoners were released from those
two prisoners and others were selected from other lockups in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were handed over to the Palestinian side at
checkpoints near Tulkarm, Ramallah, Hebron and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Among the 151 prisoners being released, 44 were involved in
attacks that led to light injuries of Israeli citizens, 42 from
other Arab countries, 38 murdered suspected Arab collaborated 10
members of the Islamic Militant Resistance Movement (Hamas) and
Islamic Jihad (freedom fighters) and five of them from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
This was the second group of Palestinian prisoners being
released by Israel. Israel released the first batch of 199 on
September 9.
</P>
<P>
Friday's release came a week later than scheduled due to a
dispute between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators over the list
of prisoners. Isreal refuses to free Palestinians who killed
Israelis or who were arrested for attacking Israelis after Israel
and Palestinians began signing interim peace accords in 1993.
</P>
<P>
For the Palestinians, the issue of the prisoners remaining in
Israeli jails is one of the most sensitive and emotional in the
peace process - almost every Palestinian family has had at least
one member in an Israeli prison.
</P>
<P>
Mahane Ofer near Ramallah is one of the crossings where the
Palestinian prisoners were freed Friday.
</P>
<P>
A large group of Palestinians were waiting there to meet their
beloved ones coming home.
</P>
<P>
"I have been waiting for 15 years for my son to come home and
thank Allah my son is going out from Israeli jail today,"
61-year-old Aziz told Xinhua, while waiting for the buses loaded
with the prisoners to come.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner release is part of the implementation of the
Sharm el-Sheikh peace deal and Israel will free another group of
Palestinian prisoners by the end of the year ahead the Muslim's
holy month of Ramadan.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo, has resigned his post as the chairman of the Advisory
Council of Transparency International (TI), a Berlin-based
international anti-corruption coalition he co-founded.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 yearly report of the organization released at the
on-going 9th International Anti-corruption Conference held in
Durban, South Africa, said the position was bestowed on Obasanjo
when he was imprisoned by the government of late Gen. Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
"Upon my election as President of Nigeria, I have had to resign
the chairmanship of the Transparency International (TI) advisory
council," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo added that his involvement with TI was indeed a great
and wonderful opportunity to assist in fashioning an enduring
framework for tackling with vigor the often time corrosive,
deleterious and debilitating scourge that corruption has become.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that I have a well spring of ideas to draw on as we
also attempt to confront headlong the erection of an integrity
system in Nigeria ... and in seeking to leave an enduring legacy
of zero to corruption."
</P>
<P>
Kamal Hossain from Bangladesh has succeeded Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The organization listed Nigeria earlier this year as the top
corruptive country in the world, which was generally considered as
a result of decades of mismanagement by former military regimes.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Veteran Politician Josef Burg Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Josef Burg, founder of
Israel's National Religious Party (NRP), died Friday at the age of
90.
</P>
<P>
Born in Dresden, Germany, Burg arrived in British-mandated
Palestine just before the outbreak of World War II in 1939. He
spent 40 years in the Knesset (parliament) after Israel's
establishment in 1948 and served as health, posts, welfare,
interior, police and religious portfolios in the government until
his retirement from politics in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Burg symbolized the elite of European Jews who long dominated
politics in Israel. His NRP spearheaded Jewish settlement efforts
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, areas Israel occupied in the 1967
Middle East War. However, Burg was widely regarded as a dove among
ranks in the party.
</P>
<P>
After Israel's signing of the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979,
Burg led a Palestinian Autonomy Committee that failed to make
progress on Palestinian self-rule, later realized under an
interim peace deal signed between Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has lost one of its senior public servants, a man who
led the religious Zionist camp for dozens of years and worked
tirelessly on behalf of all the people," Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said in a condolence statement.
</P>
<P>
Burg's son, Avraham Burg, is currently speaker of the 15th
Knesset.

<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese-made household
electronic appliances are of good quality and most of the products
from China's large enterprises are up to national standards,
according to the State Quality and Technical Supervision
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The administration conducted a selective examination of 1,742
products made by 1,598 enterprises across China from July to
September, and about 79 percent of them reached national standards.
</P>
<P>
The examination shows that Chinese household appliances as a
whole are up to standard, with the rate for washing machines,
refrigerators, microwave ovens and range hood reaching 96 percent,
94 percent, 92 percent and 77 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China is the world's largest producer of washing
machines and microwave ovens. The annual output of washing
machines exceeds 10 million sets, and that of microwave ovens is
expected to reach eight million this year.
</P>
<P>
The quality of many Chinese-made home appliances is near or
equal to that of similar products in other countries, but the
prices for Chinese products are much lower.
</P>
<P>
The examination also indicates that 97 percent of the products
made by large enterprises met national standards, 13.6 and 27
percentage points higher than the products of medium-sized and
small enterprises, respectively. The exam also shows that state-
owned enterprises manufacture better quality products than private
enterprises.

have to be addressed," she added.

Addressing the distinction between the two phenomena, asylum
and migration, Halonen said Europe's migration policy must be

asylum has to be safeguarded.

HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the
Registration and Electoral Office of Hong Kong reminded nominees
intending to run in the District Councils election to hand in
their nomination forms as early as practicable before the
nomination period closes next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We would advise nominees not to hand in forms in the last
minute. They should allow leeway to rectify mistakes in the
entries on their forms and not to put themselves in the risk of
having their nomination being invalidated," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 640 people have already submitted nomination forms
in the past eight days since the two-week nomination period
started on October 7.
</P>
<P>
A total of 390 District Council members will be elected on
Sunday, November 28 to join 18 District Councils.
</P>
<P>
"Any registered elector aged 21 or above and has ordinarily
lived in Hong Kong for the three years immediately before the
nomination may join the race," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nominees must hand in their completed nomination forms in
person to the Returning Officer of the constituency they are
contesting and pay a deposit in the sum of 3,000 HK dollars (about
384 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Each nomination must be subscribed by at least 10 registered
electors in the constituency the nominee is contesting. Each
elector is entitled to subscribe to only one nomination.
</P>
<P>
"Nominees should play safe and solicit the support of more than
10 subscribers in case some of the subscribers may be found
ineligible after validation by Returning Officers," the spokesman
said.

TAMPERE, Finland, October 15 (Xinhua) -- European Parliament
President Nicole Fontaine said here Friday that the European Union
(EU) must innovate in order to make Europe more comprehensible to
its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Giving a speech at a special European Union (EU) summit which

Fontaine called on the heads of state of the 15-member EU to
lay foundations for a "qualitative step forward" through EU
leaders' political will.

It is the responsibility of the EU "to convince our fellow
citizens that the Union is genuinely capable of turning these
approaches into practical action," she said.

The EU parliament president admits that this is not a easy task,
but she believes that it is necessary to solve the "problems by
means of innovative approaches".

CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources
has launched a national project to enhance the production of
cotton in cooperation with the private sector and cooperative
societies in the cotton-growing provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a committee was set up to examine ways and means for
promoting the production and exports of cotton. The committee
comprises representatives of the Central Bank, the Agricultural
Cooperative Credit Bank, the Yemeni Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the Agricultural and Fisheries Promotion Fund.
</P>
<P>
Yemen saw its cotton production increase from 13.8 million
pounds (6,230 tons) to 27.6 million pounds (12,500 tons) during
the 1997/98 season and it is expected to reach 76 million pounds
(34,500 tons) by the end of the current season, director of
Agricultural Services Abdullah Baashar said.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi Al Zamil Air Conditioners Company has
signed a contract with a offshoot of Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Company worth some 5.3 million U.S. dollars to provide
high intensity air conditioning sets to the Ghazlan project, a
2,400-megawatt electric plant.
</P>
<P>
Al Zamil Air Conditioners will be importing cooling systems
from Mitsubishi starting November until May 2000.
</P>
<P>
Al Zamil, producing 440,000 window air conditioners a year,
exports its products to more than 23 countries in Europe, America,
Africa and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan produced 407.7 million cigarettes during the
first seven months of 1999, down by 48.97 percent from 798.9
million cigarettes during the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the production last July has increased by 43.6 percent
with an output of 80.1 million cigarettes as compared to 59.5
million cigarettes last June, the Al Charq Al Awsat newspaper
quoted a Central Bank statistical bulletin as saying.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Freezes Former Nigerian Leader's Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland has frozen the bank
accounts held by former Nigerian leader Sani Abacha, his family
members and some associates at the request of the Nigerian
government.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Friday quoted a statement by Swiss
Federal Office for Police Matters as saying that the accounts were
frozen on Wednesday at five banks: four in Geneva and one in
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Besides the late Head of State Abacha, the accounts also
belonged to his widow Maryam, his eldest surviving son Mohammed
and his brother Abdul Kabir, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Others who came under the hammer are Abacha's National Security
Adviser Alhaji Ismaila Gwarzo, former minister Abubakar Attiku
Bagudu, four Nigerian business executives and a series of
companies.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland made the decision when Mohammed Abacha, the late
Head of State' s eldest surviving son, Personal Security Chief
Hamza Al-Mustapha and four other former security operatives were
charged Thursday with the murder of Kudirat Abiola, wife of the
late millionaire and opposition politician Moshood Abiola.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss statement neither named the banks where the accounts
were frozen, nor indicated the amounts involved, saying the
federal police authorities in Bern had not yet been informed of
the value of the frozen assets.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the freezing of the accounts is
provisional, based on a preliminary request from a Geneva attorney
representing the Olusegun Obasanjo administration.
</P>
<P>
"Nigerian authorities suspect that for some years Sani Abacha
and the others 'systematically plundered' the Nigerian Central
Bank," the statement said, adding that Abacha and his group will
be charged with crimes including "embezzlement, fraud, forgery and
money laundering."
</P>
<P>
The Swiss authorities cited Nigeria's Justice Minister Kanu
Agabi as having consolidated the various criminal proceedings
against members of the alleged criminal organization founded by
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has three months to file a formal request for mutual
legal assistance indicating the relationship between criminal
proceedings in the country and the assets frozen in Switzerland,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who took office on May 29, promised at his inaugural
ceremony to foster a "new moral direction" for the country, which
had been devastated by years of poor military rule.
</P>
<P>
Abacha, who seized power in 1993 after the turmoil that
followed a presidential election annulled by the military, ruled
the oil-producing country with an iron fist. He died in June,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers suggested that corruptive officials under
different military regimes had looted over 30 billion U.S. dollar
state assets.

<HEADLINE> Estrada to Personally Lead Charter Change Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Friday that he will personally lead the campaign to
inform the public about the benefits of the proposed
Constitutional Corrections for Development (Concord).
</P>
<P>
The president noted in a statement that a recent survey showed
that less than 18 percent of Filipinos are aware of the benefits
of the Concord-initiated economic reforms for the economy and
their daily life.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that given the chance to fully
understand the advantages of his proposed economic reforms through
the Concord, the people would "vote overwhelmingly in favor of
this initiative."
</P>
<P>
The president has created the Cabinet Task Force Concord to
draw up and implement an advocacy plan aimed at informing the
people about the economic reforms through the Concord process.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will lead the launching of the Concord
information campaign next month with local government officials,
members of Congress, the business sector and non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is the people who will decide the fate of
the Concord through a plebiscite, which will come after Congress
has deliberated on it and the Preparatory Commission on
Constitutional Reforms completes its task by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that to cope with population growth, bold
economic reforms proposed in the Concord are needed to enable the
government to meet the needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said these economic reforms include the lifting of the
constitutional restrictions on the foreign ownership of land and
equity in key industries and the public utilities sector.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that he is starting his Concord campaign early
to give people enough time to study the Concord process and decide
on it before 200l, his target date for implementing these economic
reforms.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After the rejection by the U.S. Senate of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on Wednesday, all experts of world
strategic security in Washington agreed that the treaty was from
now dead and buried. By risking the credibility of the United
States which used to pose itself as the champion of non-
proliferation of nuclear weapons, the Republicans have given the
greenlight to those countries seeking nuclear arsenals, which the
treaty tried to ban.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Europe lived one moment of history on Thursday when the
French aerospace and defense group Aerospatiale-Matra and the
German DASA announced in Strasbourg their merger. Baptized EADS,
the new group will be the biggest shareholder of Airbus plane-
maker and will be Europe's biggest aeronautic and defense group
and the world's number one in helicopter making and satellite
launching.
</P>
<P>
-- The rejection by the U.S. Senate of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, which is aimed at banning nuclear tests, has reduced
the international credibility of the United States and caused
strong concern in the world, especially among nuclear power states.

<HEADLINE> HK's Golden Jubilee Together Delegation to Visit Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong delegation will
go to Beijing Saturday to present an album listing out names of
110 inland schools financed by Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
The project is part of the efforts initiated by the Golden
Jubilee Together Organizing Committee to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by David Lan, Secretary for Home Affairs of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, will include more
than 130 representatives of individuals and organizations, which
have donated money for building or renovating schools in remote
and impoverished areas of inland.
</P>
<P>
Bayin Chaolu, chairman of the China Youth Development
Foundation, will receive the album on behalf of the Central
Government at the presentation ceremony to be held at the Great
Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Jubilee Together Organizing Committee was set up in
June this year by 15 Hong Kong personalities born in 1949, the
same year the People' Republic of China was established.
</P>
<P>
They share the dual objectives of mobilizing the community to
set up a permanent charity to provide emergency relief to disaster
victims and to coordinate the community's efforts to finance the
building of schools for needy children in the inland.
</P>
<P>
Since inauguration, the organizing committee has raised more
than 10 million HK dollars (1.3 million U.S. dollars) for the
Golden Jubilee Together Charity Foundation as emergency disaster
relief.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 22 million HK dollars (2.8 U.S. million
dollars) have been pledged by Hong Kong people for building and
reconstruction of schools for children in the remote parts of the
Chinese inland.

<HEADLINE> China Turns to Kodak to Help Preserve Rare Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese documentary authorities
and Kodak's branch in China jointly held a seminar here this week
to explore ways of using microfilm to preserve the country's
hundreds of millions of state documents.
</P>
<P>
Kodak company displayed its Kodak InfoGuard System at the
seminar in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Yiquan, an official from the State Archives
Bureau, confidentiality and security issues have become major
concerns of computer science. The present electronic document has
major shortcomings yet to be overcome, he said, namely the
relatively short life span of the carrier of information, the
rapid evolution of technological standards of both software and
hardware, and the difficulties in proving the authenticity of
electronic documents.
</P>
<P>
He said that microfilm technologies should be developed quickly
in order to provide a strong and reliable backup for the
electronic archives.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 240 million files of documents in
government-run archives around the country. About ten percent of
them must be preserved permanently. Many are yet to be made public
and concern major historical events that have occurred since the
New China was founded 50 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Three Gang Members From Macao Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zhuhai City Intermediate
People's Court today handed down death sentences for three
underworld gang members from Macao who were convicted of murder,
robbery, kidnapping, and gun trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The three criminals to be executed include the gang's leader Ye
Chengjian, who is from Hong Kong, and his two accomplices, He
Jingsheng and Li Xinwen. Twelve other members of the gang received
sentences ranging from death with reprieve, life imprisonment, and
other set terms of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The gang has committed a series of violent crimes in Macao and
the Chinese mainland over the past few years. On November 8, 1998,
the gang murdered a man whose family name was Wu in Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
On November 12, 1994, the gang kidnapped two Taiwanese
businessman and demanded ransom of three million Taiwanese yuan

gang broke into the home of a Zhuhai resident and took 500,000 U.S.
dollars and 840,000 Hong Kong dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cooperatives Guarding Against Financial Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese cooperatives at various
levels have begun a massive investigation into the use of large
sums paid in shares by farmers and employees in a bid to
circumvent possible financial fraud.
</P>
<P>
Raising funds among farmers is an important way to enhance the
supply of local goods and boost marketing in order to provide
better services for farmers. But in recent years, some of the
money raised for farmers has been illegally channeled for other
uses, such as providing banking services.
</P>
<P>
Wang Ruzhen, deputy director of the All China Federation of
Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, said that "without the fund,
cooperatives cannot play their proper role in serving farmers. The
urgent task is to return the farmers' money for their needs."
</P>
<P>
Fund misuse is mainly concentrated in several provinces, and
many of them are dealing with the problem, said Bi Meijia, who is
also with the federation.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, local cooperatives had raised 27.7 billion
yuan, among which 14.5 billion yuan belonged to farmers, 6.4
billion yuan to cooperative employees, and 5.9 billion yuan to
urban residents.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Switzerland-based World
Economic Forum (WEF), in partnership with the Singapore Economic
Development Board, will hold its 8th East Asia Economic Summit in
Singapore on October 18-20.
</P>
<P>
WEF Managing Director Claude Smadja told a press conference
here Friday that some 900 high-level business representatives from
WEF member companies, heads of government and key ministers from
the region as well as leaders from international organizations
will take part in the forum.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will deliver key-note
speeches at plenary sessions and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong will give a key-note address at an official opening dinner
where Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew will also exchange
views with the delegates.
</P>
<P>
Smadja said the summit is designed to give a strong message
that Asia is back on growth and to emphasize the long process and
enormous task East Asia is facing in ensuring economic recovery,
long-term growth and stability.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the summit will feature a series of briefings
on highly relevant and specialized subjects for in-depth analysis
and experience sharing as well as for in-depth updates on national
economies with government leaders and senior officials from each
country and economy.
</P>
<P>
The topics on the agenda include the way forward after emerging
from the Asian financial crisis, economic outlook for Asia, the
road to a sustainable recovery in Asia, the management of
sovereign and corporate risk, banking and financial restructuring,
corporate structuring, major uncertainty factors in the region,
the building of competitiveness in knowledge-based economy,
electronic-commerce in Asia, and monetary stability in Asia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asian Business Advantage Leading to New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- In moving into the new
millennium, Asian business will have a competitive advantage as it
has experienced dramatic shifts in economic environments in a
relatively short period, business leaders here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Participants at a closed forum, entitled "Managing the Speed of
Change: Meeting the Needs of Tomorrow", believed that the business
community will drive much of the speed of change in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders said that Asia's ability to begin recovery is
a strong indicator of the resilience and agility of a majority of
Asian business to changes in the market environment.
</P>
<P>
Leadership, corporate flexibility and transformation, e-
commerce, brand building, applying technology, and developing a
21st century workforce will all determine just how successful that
change will be, they said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening dinner of the Business Week CEO Forum
held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel Wednesday evening, Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
said that Hong Kong's economic philosophy has remained unchanged
since it became a special administrative region of China on July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been successful for a long time because of its
belief in the free market, its belief in letting market forces
dictate the pace of the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe this very strongly," Tung noted. "We do
not wish to interfere at all. We will only interfere when the
market is being distorted, or being monopolized." He also spoke of
his vision and plan to position Hong Kong as Asia's premier
international city in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Because Asia's future is inevitably linked to China's future,
the participation of senior Chinese government officials at the
forum was met with great enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaosong, chairman of China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade (CCPIT), said, "As Asia copes with the
aftermath of the region's financial crisis, China will no doubt
serve as a driver of much of Asia's recovery."
</P>
<P>
Yu said that globalization has shown a growing momentum and
China as the largest developing nation in the world is seizing the
opportunities and embracing the challenges with a more open
mentality and greater enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
The CCPIT vows to make greater contribution to the promotion of
Sino-foreign economic and trade cooperation as well as China's
integration with the rest of the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. president George Bush's address on "moving into the
new millennium" at the closing ceremony became the climax of the
three-day Third Annual Business Week CEO Forum, which was
sponsored by the Better Hong Kong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Bush expressed his confidence in the sustainment of Asia's
economic recovery and China's entry to WTO.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 global business and political leaders joined in the
discussions on strategies and leadership Asia will require to
sustain the region's return to economic growth.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea, Venezuela Seeking Closer Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Venezuela Friday
agreed to strengthen economic ties between them by promoting
cooperation in construction and telecommunication.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here Friday afternoon by South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung and his Venezuelan counterpart Hugo Chavez,
who arrived here for a three-day visit Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed ways to enhance bilateral relations
and agreed to push forward the South Korean-Venezuelan cooperation
in road construction, telecommunication and petroleum industries,
said South Korean presidential spokesman Park Joon-young after the
summit.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that South Korea's capital and technology can be
combined with Venezuela's natural resources and workforce to
maximize potential for bilateral economic cooperation," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
South Korean officials said the summit will provide momentum
toward fostering trade and investment ties between the two nations.
</P>

South Korean businessmen are now getting involved in various
business projects ranging from oil drilling and refining and road
construction to mobile communications and defense industry.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade volume between the two countries stood at 2.95
million U.S. dollars last year. South Korean exports, which mostly
were electronics, steel, footwear, automobile and textile,
amounted to 2.7 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chave's visit is the first one by a Venezuelan president since
the two states established diplomatic relations in 1965.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the third leg of Chave's Asian-European tour,
which has taken him to China and Japan. He will visit Malaysia,
Singapore, the Philippines, Spain and France later.

<HEADLINE> Int'l PC Giant Wants Bigger Share in Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett Packard (HP),
announcing a formal march into China's personal computer market
here today, unveiled its plan to become one of the three largest
home PC sellers in the country in the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
HP is the last of the world's four largest computer giants to
sell PCs in China, following Compaq, IBM and Dell.
</P>
<P>
China, whose 1.2 billion population has long been a target for
international computer manufacturers, is poised to become the
second-largest PC market by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
China's home PC sales account for 34 percent of Asia-Pacific's
total and has swelled by 50-80 percent a year, according to latest
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 40 percent of families living in developed countries
have purchased a home computer, while in China, only four percent
of 46 million urban Chinese families own a computer.
</P>
<P>
Eager to share the booming home PC market in China, where local
computer makers have been busy marketing their low-price products,
HP has introduced its new PCs with some unique features, including
a CD writer and a one-touch keyboard.
</P>
<P>
HP hopes its high quality and easy-to-use products, along with
its sales warranties could be helpful as it explores the Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, HP began to sell its home PCs in North America, and to
date it ranks second there and first in Asia-Pacific Region for
those computers.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Washington to Resume Talks on U.S. Stationing Troops' Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Seoul and Washington have agreed
to resume talks on revising the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)
before the end of the year, said South Korean Foreign Ministry
Hong Soon-young Friday.
</P>
<P>
The SOFA is designed to regulate the legal status of United
States troops on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached last Wednesday when U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Stanley Roth came here to help form a
coordination group on the Nogunri incident -- an ocurrence in
which South Korean civilians were killed by U.S. troops in 1950
early on in the Korean War -- and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean minister said the talks will attempt to settle
priority issues first and then move on to other problems.
</P>
<P>
Among the priority issues is the handover of U.S. servicemen
accused of murder and rape during the Nogunri incident to South
Korean authorities.
</P>
<P>
Under the current SOFA, accused U.S. serviceman will be handed
over to South Korea only after a court sentence is given.
</P>
<P>
Both Seoul and Washington have agreed in principle to transfer
the accused to South Korea but they remain divided over whether to
allow legal counsel to attend interrogations of suspects.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean legal system allows the prosecution to appeal
to a higher court against any lower court ruling that prosecutors
believe unsatisfactory, while the U.S. one does not allow the
prosecution to appeal to a higher court case that a lower court
has found not guilty.
</P>
<P>
Other issues such as Environmental pollution and labor rights
of South Korean employees at U.S. military bases are also expected
to be revised during the forthcoming talks.

<HEADLINE> India Concerned Over Direction of Pakistan Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- India expressed concern
Friday over the direction in which the situation in Pakistan was
moving and virtually ruled out immediate resumption of the stalled
bilateral dialogue with Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is effectively under martial law following a military
coup," said a spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry. "We have
concerns about the direction in which the situation is moving."
</P>
<P>
"We continue to monitor and keep a close watch on these
developments," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of resumption of the stalled talks with
Pakistan, the spokesman said, "until the internal situation in
Pakistan becomes clear, it is difficult to say whether bilateral
talks could begin immediately."
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Friday that New Delhi's
concerns are in the context of the proclamation issued by
Pakistani Army Chief Pervez Musharraf enforcing a state of
emergency, keeping the Constitution in abeyance and declaring
himself the chief executive of the country.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after taking over as Indian prime minister on
Wednesday, Atal Bihari Vajpayee expressed grave concern over
developments in Islamabad, saying that vigilance on the
international border with Pakistan had been intensified but the
"situation is normal".
</P>
<P>
Asserting that it was for Islamabad to create the right climate
for resumption of stalled dialogue between the two neighbors, he
said that India's policy towards Islamabad was "consistent and
principled".
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that his country remained committed to developing
friendly relations and cooperative ties with Pakistan based on
mutual trust and confidence for which the government of Pakistan
needs to create the right environment.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kashmir said that Indian security forces guarding
the northern borders with Pakistan were on full alert and any
attempt aimed at India "on the borders or inside" would receive a
befitting reply.

<HEADLINE> Bombing Continues on Rebel Positions in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops continued
aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the
first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there.
</P>
<P>
Rebel command headquarters, bases and storage facilities near
the villages of Zebir-yurt, Pervomaiskoye, Raduzhnoye and Dolinsky
were targeted in the latest raids, the Interfax news agency
reported, citing the press service of the Russian Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a radio station of the Severny airport and a
bridge near the village of Chishki were also destroyed, the press
service said.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops "blocked off 23 villages in the Chechen
districts of Shelkovsky, Naursky and Nadterechny," the service
said.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign was launched following armed Chechen
intrusions into the Daghestan republic and bomb blasts in four
apartment buildings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two
other Russian cities. Authorities believe Chechen rebels
masterminded the terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of federal troops in Chechnya,
said Friday that the first stage of the counter-terrorist
operation has been successfully completed and that federal troops
have assumed control over one third of the Chechen territory.
</P>
<P>
"We created such circumstances that (militants) should expect
us anywhere, any time. This is what's happening now," he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces have fully seized the military initiative,
Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
As the federal campaign against rebels continues, more refugees
are flowing from Chechnya to other Russian regions nearby.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations put the total
number of Chechen refugees at over 156,000, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is especially difficult in the tiny republic of
Ingushetia where over 147,000 refugees are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Migration Service says the number of refugees may
eventually rise to 300,000.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are rushing tents, clothes, food, medicines and
other humanitarian aid supplies to the refugees.

<P>
KIEV, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on
Friday voiced serious concerns over the refusal by the U.S. Senate
to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the ministry said that as a country
which has dismissed using nuclear weapons, Ukraine clearly knows
the importance of the treaty which is a crucial part to sustaining
world stability, Ukrainian Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry stressed that nuclear-capable countries must
assume the responsibility for enacting the treaty. They must make
efforts to insure that the treaty is ratified and takes effect in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate voted 51-48 Wednesday to reject the CTBT. More
than 150 countries have signed the pact but it cannot go into
force unless all 44 nuclear-capable states, including the United
States, ratify it.

<HEADLINE> PNA, Israel to Talk on Freeing More Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official said
on Friday that the Palestinian and Israeli sides would embark on
negotiations next week for the release of a third batch of
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Prisoners Affairs Hisham Asaid the two sides will discu
ss the criteria for, and the
number of, those to be set free in the third group during
neasting, as stipulated
in the Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum the two sides signed in September.
</P>
<P>
Israel released 151 so-called Palestinian security prisoners
Friday morning as part of the implementation of this memorandum.
Eighty-three of the released were handed over to the Palestinian
side in Gaza, and the rest in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The release of the second batch of Palestinians had been
delayed for a week because of a dispute between the two sides over
precisely who should be freed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side had insisted that the rules fixed in their
memorandum be followed, demanding the release of those serving
long, even life, sentences for actions against Israel before the
signing of the Oslo accords and detained before the Palestinian
self-rule came into force.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side, on the other hand, had insisted that 47
prisoners be replaced by others serving shorter sentences.
</P>
<P>
At long last, the two sides reached a compromise whereby the
Palestinian side agreed on the release of nine youngsters
sentences to two to three years, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
So far, Israel has released 350 Palestinian prisoners in two
batches since the signing of Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum which
brought the Mideast peace process back on track.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Minimum wage earners in the
Philippine capital of Manila will receive a pay hike of 25.50
pesos (0.64 U.S. dollars) effective from December 29, the Regional
Tripartite Wage and Productivity Board announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, minimum wage earners in the Cagayan Valley region were
granted a pay hike of 10 to 12 pesos (0.25 to 0.3 U.S. dollars) by
the regional wage board, while those in Southern Mindanao were
given a minimum wage increase of 13 to 13.50 pesos (0.33 to 0.34
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma urged other regional wage
boards in the country to come up with new wage orders for minimum
wage adjustments as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said petitions
for wage adjustments should consider various factors, such as the
welfare of both the labor and management, the consumers and the
effect on the inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Estrada reiterated that wage board decisions should ensure that
workers keep their jobs and business remains operational.
</P>
<P>
The president said drastic pay increases would most likely hurt
small and medium enterprises which comprise the majority of
private business in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economy's attractiveness to foreign investors
may also be diminished if very high wage increases are implemented
since overseas businessmen would opt to bring their investments in
countries where pay scales are lower.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Declining in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 15 (Xinhua ) -- The poverty alleviation programs
undertaken by the Bangladeshi government have achieved remarkable
success with a gradual decline in the percentage of the poor in
the country since 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to "Three Years of Progress," a document on the
achievements of the current government led by Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina till June this year, poverty alleviation has been
given top priority since the ruling Awami League (the People's
League) came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The document released by the official Bangladesh News Agency
here Friday, citing surveys conducted by Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics (BBS), said that about half of the population of 120
million were still in poverty in Bangladesh but there was marked
improvement that the percentage of poor people has been declining
with the implementation of scores of development programs
throughout the country since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The BBS recent surveys showed that the percentage of the poor
in rural areas declined from 47.9 percent in April 1996 to 47.6
percent in April 1998 and in urban areas from 44.4 percent to 44.3
percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
It was observed in the document that the Annual Development
Program with an allocation of around 70 billion taka (1.4 billion
U.S. dollars) for agriculture, rural development, water resources
development, primary education, health and family welfare, rural
electrification and local government, among other sectors, had
made direct and indirect contribution to poverty alleviation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The poverty alleviation programs were prioritized through
providing credit and training to unemployed youths and women for
self-employment under the purview of the 5th five-year plan to be
completed in the year 2002.

<P>
OTTAWA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian software magnate
Michael Cowpland is being charged with insider trading and
prohibited from trading for at least 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The country's top securities regulator, the Ontario Securities
Commission (OSC), filed quasi-criminal charges against the
flamboyant entrepreneur in the Ontario Court of Justice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The OSC alleges that Cowpland, 56, sold shares of Corel for 20.
4 million Canadian dollars (about 13.8 million U.S. dollars) in
August 1997, after learning that Ottawa-based Corel Corp. would
fall far short of the third-quarter sales target of 94 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The OSC charged the Corel president with acting on insider
information through his personal company M.C.J.C. Holdings Inc.,
without disclosing to the public the anticipated sales shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The charges can result in a jail term of up to two years, plus
a maximum fine of 1 million Canadian dollars (about 675,400 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The OSC also slapped a 15-day ban on Cowpland and his personal
M.C.J.C. Holding Inc. from trading in Corel stock.
</P>
<P>
Corel has said that Cowpland and the company "continue to deny
all insider trading allegations."
</P>
<P>
According to the OSC sources, a court date has been set for
November 22, but the case will probably not get to trial until
late spring.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Meets Slovakia Parliament Delegation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee, met with a
delegation from the Slovak National Council led by its chairman
Jozef Migas, here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The China-Slovakia relationship has proceeded healthily and
stably since the two countries forged diplomatic ties, and the NPC
and the Slovak National Council have maintained normal ties, Li
said, adding his belief that the current visit will give impetus
to the further growth of the ties between both countries and both
parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that over the past years, bilateral
cooperation in political, economic, scientific and cultural fields
have progressed steadily, thanks to efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The continual exchange of visits between leaders of both
countries has promoted mutual understanding and friendship, as
well as exchange and cooperation in various fields, added Li,
hoping that both countries further develop friendship and
cooperation in all fields including trade, on the basis of
equality and mutual-benefit.
</P>
<P>
Regarding parliamentary relations, Li said that parliament-to-
parliament exchange constitutes an important part of the state-to-
state relationship, as both the NPC and the Slovak National
Council play important roles in political life of their own
countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the NPC maintains active ties with the Slovak
National Council to promote understanding and expand common ground
so as to contribute to the further growth of friendship and
cooperation between the two countries.

<P>
Li reiterated that China adopts an independent foreign policy
of peace and respects the development paths chosen by the people
of all countries. Moreover, China advocated that the world should
"be a multi-polar world" and opposed the empty rhetoric that "
human rights is above sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The non-violation of sovereignty is clearly written in the U.N.
Charter," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On China's reunification, Li said that China will resume its
exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20 this year.
However, China still has not realized final reunification, for "
there is still a Taiwan issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose the 'state-to-state' malice of Lee Teng-hui, for it
is against the will of the whole Chinese people, including the
Taiwan compatriots," he said. On the recent Taiwan earthquake
disaster, Li again expressed deep concern and said that China will
extend "all possible aid that can be offered."
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his appreciation for Slovakia's consistent one
China stance.
</P>
<P>
Migas said he felt honored to visit China after the election of
the new Slovak National Council in 1998 and offered his
congratulations on the 50th anniversary of the founding of new
China.
</P>
<P>
"I wish China to be a rich nation with strong people and make
greater achievements in the reform and opening-up," he told Li.
</P>
<P>
Even though Slovakia is a small country, he said, "One of the
key objects for our country is to continue to develop a good
relationship with China" for the two countries have enjoyed a long
tradition of friendship.

As parliament head, he considered that the Slovak National
Council and China's NPC should have comprehensive contacts and
make particular efforts to enhance exchanges and cooperation
between special committees of the two parliaments and the local
legislative branches.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated Slovakia's "one China" stance and his
country's support for China's reunification and said that Slovakia
would not have any official contact with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also highly praised the cooperation between the two
countries in international affairs and hoped such cooperation
could continue.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the guests on China's national people's
congress system.
</P>
<P>
Before the conclusion of the meeting, Migas extended an
invitation to Li to visit Slovokia and Li accepted the invitation
with pleasure.

<HEADLINE> France to Keep Rights in Merging Aerospace and Defense Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- France will retain its rights in
the aerospace and defense group which is soon to be merged with
Germany, Agence France-Press said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Such rights include production control of ballistic missiles
that will be used in the French nuclear deterrence force, Agence
France-Presse quoted a source in the defense ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
France will sign a "convention" with the future European
Aeronautic, Defense and Space Co. (EADS), which will result from a
merger between Aerospatiale-Matra of France and DASA of Germany.
It will become the world's second largest missile maker after U.S.
Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
It said the convention will be drawn according to French laws
and will give France the right to protect its defense interests,
notably those concerned with ballistic missiles for its nuclear
deterrence force.
</P>
<P>
It said the French government will also maintain its "golden
share" or veto rights within the EADS, including the right to
block management decisions on mergers, acquisitions and takeovers,
and to decide upon the conception and integration of ballistic
missiles in the group.
</P>
<P>
The government will retain 47.7 percent of the shares of
Aerospatiale-Matra and will reduce to 15 percent its shares in
EADS when it is set up in the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot said
Friday that the government shares in EADS will never disappear.
</P>
<P>
"If there is a conflict (with Germany), the French side will
have the right to buy back," said Gayssot in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Daimler Chrysler, a German private group which owns DASA, has
urged France to privatize completely the Aerospatiale-Matra and
withdraw government interference from the group.

<HEADLINE> Georgian Gunmen Release Kidnapped U.N. Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian gunmen who
abducted six U.N. military observers and an interpreter on
Wednesday have released all their captives, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported Friday, quoting law enforcement sources from the
former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers released two U.N. observers and their
interpreter Friday. Four other hostages were freed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if a ransom was paid. The gunmen had
reportedly demanded 200,000 U.S. dollars and later raised the
figure to 300,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. workers were abducted in the Kodori Valley, a remote
mountainous area situated in the breakaway region of Abkhazia but
controlled by Georgian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Tass said the gunmen have already left the Kodor Valley. A
helicopter is scheduled to transport them to Kutaisi, Georgia,
from where they will go to Sukhumi, the capital city of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
The hostage release came after intensive negotiations between
the terrorists and high-ranking Georgian officials, including
Defense Minister David Tevzadze and President Eduard Shevardnadze'
s representative in the Kodor Valley, Iveri Chelidze, Tass said.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Urges Taiwanese to Release Inland Chinese Fishermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) today called for the release of
the 40 inland Chinese fishermen being willfully detained by Taiwan
army and police.
</P>
<P>
According to ARATS officials, about 200 fishermen from Zhejiang
and Fujian provinces have been detained by Taiwan army and police
in the first eight months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Forty fishermen and 12 fishing boats remain in custody of
Taiwanese police.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS officials said that the Taiwan police should stop
detaining inland Chinese fishermen for no reason, and cease
inhumane behaviors such as assaulting and humiliating the
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
"The detained fishermen and their boats should be released as
soon as possible," the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with Fujian Province, on August 31, the
Minshi--6111 fishing boat, while operating in the Taiwan Straits,
was stopped by a Taipei Police cruise vessel on the allegation of
carrying guns.
</P>
<P>
The boat owner, Cai Liangman, was beaten for being slow to open
a cabinet on the ship. Police aimed their guns at the crew members
and forced them to kneel.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS officials said that the wrongdoings by the Taiwanese
army and police have been detrimental to the life, livelihood and
property of the inland Chinese fishermen, and caused relevant
departments on the mainland greatly concerned.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Embrace Challenges With Greater Enthusiasm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China, as the largest
developing nation in the world, is seizing the opportunities and
embracing the challenges with a more open mentality and greater
enthusiasm, a senior trade official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yu Xiaosong, chairman of China Council for the Promotion of
International trade (CCPIT), made the remarks at the Third Annual
Business Week CEO Forum, which was held at the Grand Hyatt Hotel
from October 13 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, China's economic growth achieved an
average rate of 7.7 percent, 2.5 times that of the world's average
level in the same period, laying a solid foundation for the
sustained development of the country in the next century, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
However, the changes of international economic environment and
the problems that have cropped up in the reform process are
undoubtedly challenges for China, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the new century, Yu said the Chinese government and business
community will, from a new perspective, make a choice on the
orientation of the country's development that is suitable to its
realities.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that globalization has shown a growing momentum in
recent years. The high-level decision-making bodies in China have
realized the necessity to accelerate the technological revamping
and industrial upgrading of state-owned enterprise in order to
adapt to the great trend of structural readjustment of global
industries and changes of demand on domestic and foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the sustained, rapid and healthy development
of China's economy has provided a large market for investors from
all around the world.
</P>
<P>
With continued reform and development of state-owned
enterprises, Yu said foreign investors are offered favorable
opportunities whether in terms of technology, capital or
structural readjustment.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, the Chinese government will adopt preferential
policies to encourage foreign investors to invest in the middle
and western part of the country," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"China will also adopt more open and liberal policies for
foreign investment in order to participate in the international
division of labor on a larger scale," Yu added.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has enlarged the areas of foreign
investment in the sectors of commercial circulation, foreign trade,
finance, insurance and tourism, and considerations are being made
to open accounting and legal services to foreign investment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue whether China can enter the WTO or not is a matter
of grave concern for both China and the rest of the world," Yu
said. "We have not changed our attitude and we still take an
active position."
</P>
<P>
In the new century, the CCPIT will make greater contributions
to the promotion of Sino-foreign economic and trade cooperation as
well as China's integration with the rest of the world, he
concluded.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 international business and political leaders,
including Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, and former U.S. president George Bush,
attended the forum with the theme of "Managing the speed of Change:
Meeting the Needs of Tomorrow".

<HEADLINE> Record Number of Visitors to HK Electronics Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of visitors to the
19th Hong Kong Electronics Fair held between October 12 and 15
increased around 20 percent over that to the last event in 1998,
to nearly 40,000, according to the fair's independent auditor.
</P>
<P>
Half of the buyers were from overseas, which was around 24
percent more than in 1998. The largest number of visitors came
from Asia (up 23.28 percent), followed by Europe (up 20.16 percent)
and North America (up 24.22 percent).
</P>
<P>
The record participation of visitors indicates that there is an
increase in the demand for Hong Kong and Asian electronics
products, boosted in part by the recent revival in consumer
sentiment and an upturn in electronics production in the region,
said Allan Wong, chairman of Electronics/Electrical Appliances
Advisory Committee of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council,
organizer of the fair.
</P>
<P>
"If we look at the electronics industry with the Hong Kong
Electronics Fair as a lens, the view is definitely optimistic. It
is evident that both production and markets of the industry have
started ticking again," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
His views were shared by local and overseas exhibitors and
buyers.
</P>
<P>
Total exports of Hong Kong's electronics products from January
to August remained stable. Exports to Asian countries recorded the
highest growth rate. Total exports to South Korea, China's
mainland and Singapore increased by 59 percent, 9 percent and 4
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 20th Hong Kong Electronics Fair will be held from October
11 to 14, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Official Circular on Civil Servants Practicing Falun Gong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the State
Council recently issued a circular to local governments as well as
departments under the State Council, asking them to properly deal
with civil servants who have practiced Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Personnel and Ministry of Supervision have
jointly worked out a document on handling the issue, which should
be carried out in earnest, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The document said that it is necessary to strictly adhere to
the central authorities' policies and enable the majority of Falun
Gong practitioners to return to the correct perspective by
educational and administrative means.
</P>
<P>
Civil servants who practiced Falun Gong will not receive any
administrative penalty if they discontinue their involvement in
Falun Gong activities, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
Even those who participated in Falun Gong's illegal gathering
will not face penalty if they clearly disengage themselves from
the organization, the document said.
</P>
<P>
However, those who took part in illegal gatherings and continue
to believe in the practices even after repeated education on the
matter will face different disciplinary actions in line with their
respective conditions, it said.
</P>
<P>
Those who have been politically motivated and have organized
illegal gatherings with a result of disturbing social order and
causing social instability should be sacked, it said.
</P>
<P>
And those who have continued to be engaged in illegal
gatherings and activities after the Ministry of Public Security
banned the organization on July 22 will be severely penalized,
according to the document.
</P>
<P>
It also said that disciplinary actions should be taken
prudently and in line with offenses, in accordance with the
Provisional Regulations on Civil Servants.

<HEADLINE> Over 150 Die as Fighting Rages in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The heavy fighting at land and
at sea between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels has left
more than 150 dead in Sri Lanka's north and east, officials here
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said in a statement that government troops
had recovered 55 bodies of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE), but the rebels' casualties could be well over one hundred
in an abortive attack on troops near Ampakamam in the northern
Wanni region late on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It said air force jets and helicopters attacked retreating
rebels, and troops were in the process of pursuit and
consolidation following the fighting about 260 kilometers
northeast of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The statement said 19 soldiers were killed and 57 wounded in
the clash, the fiercest in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
A large number of rebels were also believed to have been
wounded in the fighting, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In a separate clash on Thursday night, Sri Lankan naval
gunboats attacked a flotilla of Tamil rebels' boats off Kokkilai
in the northeastern Mullaitivu district, about 270 kilometers
northeast of the capital, navy officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said some 30 guerrillas were killed when three boats were
caught fire and sunk and another boat was badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
Four sailors were wounded and four naval gunboats were slightly
damaged, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland for
minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Leprosy Eliminated in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China has brought down the
proportion of lepers in the Tibetan Autonomous Region to 0.002
percent to date, well below the 0.01 percent level set as the
elimination point by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The number of lepers in Tibet stands at 61 at present, after a
total of 3,259 lepers were cured in the past three decades,
Thubden, director of the regional health bureau, said in an
interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging result has been achieved thanks to "strenuous
efforts made by the central and regional governments," Thubden
said, noting that the proportion of lepers was as high as 0.06
percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy used to be one of the major diseases in Tibet, with
cases of the disease known as far back as 1,400 years ago. Under
the serf system in old Tibet, serfs had no access to medical
treatment and once they contracted leprosy, they were ousted from
their villages or even buried alive immediately.
</P>
<P>
Thubden said that since 1965 when the Tibetan Autonomous Region
was set up, the central and local governments have launched a
massive campaign to prevent the spread of leprosy and provide
proper medical treatment to lepers.
</P>
<P>
Some 15 hospitals specialized in treating leprosy have been
established in Tibet and modern treatment methods recommended by
the WHO have been adopted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of lepers began to fall in the 1970s. "
Now the Tibetan people are glad that they do not have to be afraid
of the disease any more," Thubden said.

<HEADLINE> Qian Kui: Less Enjoyment in All-around Competitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The all-around competitions
here at the gymnastics world championships were not as elegant and
enjoyable as before, the Chinese team leader complained on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The error-proned all-around competitions were intense, but not
enjoyable as before. The gymnasts nowadays concentrate more on the
degree of difficulty, not the grace and beauty," said Qain Kui,
Chinese team leader who has been coaching and guiding for more
than 37 years.
</P>
<P>
World and Olympic champions Svetlana Khorkina of Russia and
Simona Amanar of Romania both faded their dreams of winning the
women's all-around crown by mistakes.
</P>
<P>
The same mishap was repeated in the men's final when defending
champion Ivan Ivankov of Belarus slumped the horizontal bar and
quit the rest five apparatus afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The failure of those veterans left the titles to the unexpected
new star Maria Olaru of Romania and Nikolay Krukov of Russia,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Olaru and Krukov were very good, but they have a big gap
compared with the previous world champions," said Qian, who spend
more than 40 years in gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
"The requirement of difficulty, stableness and elegance was no
longer the trend for the gymnastics nowadays, which only focuses
on complex routines. Difficulty always cause failure for gymnasts
and departure from the audience," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about possible development of gymnastics, Qian preferred
artistry to difficulty.
</P>
<P>
"The ideal gymnastics should bring enjoyment to the audience,
as well as gymnasts themselves, like Khorkina," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Khokina, who displayed her trademark of invincible elegance and
won the uneven bars title in 9.837 at the world gymnastics
championships here on Friday, proved that the artistry still could
lead the way of gymnastics.

attacked a brothel near Bar Ubah junction, not far from Theatre
Towfiq on the same Soddonkah street.
