<HEADLINE> Khatami Presents First Budget to Iran's Majlis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- President Mohammad Khatami
today presented to the Majlis, or the Iranian parliament, his
first, non-deficit budget for approval.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Khatami told the
270-seat Majlis that the budget was worked out "in light of
existing capacities and financial discipline" and with the aim of
reforming "the overall economic structure."
</P>
<P>
The president, who came to office in August, proposed his
government's spending in the next fiscal year (starting March 21
next year) at 84.6 trillion rials (about 28.2 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the revenues are projected at the same amount to
balance the expenditures, which show a rise of 29 percent from the
current year's.
</P>
<P>
He said that 26.9 percent of the revenues would come from
taxation, 36.4 percent from oil exports, and 36.7 percent from
other sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the president failed to give breakdowns of the
expenditures, most importantly, the defense spending.
</P>
<P>
Another budget for government-owned banks, companies and other
profit organizations was projected at 149.1 trillion rials (about
49.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the overall state budget stood at nearly 233.7
trillion rials (about 77.8 billion dollars), 23.9 percent larger
than that of the current year, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said the government will cut the spending of
foreign exchange by 1.22 billion dollars, to about 14.8 billion
dollars, while its foreign exchange revenues, mainly from oil
exports, are expected to reach 17.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the end of next fiscal year, the papers said, the
government will be able to reduce its 3.6-billion-dollar foreign
debt by a further 1.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iran was forced to re-schedule its foreign debts in 1993
following a sharp decline of oil prices on the international
market. The country has paid 75 percent of its re-scheduled
foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> UK Banks Stand to Lose One Billion Pounds in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) - Banks in Britain stand to lose
more than one billion pounds (1.6 billion US dollars) in bad debts
as the Asian economic crisis spreads around the world.
</P>
<P>
They have an estimated 50 billion pounds (80 billion US
dollars) in loans to the region, figures from the Bank of England
show.
</P>
<P>
City analysts predict that the huge figures will force the
banks to allow for the heavy write-offs as their borrowers become
unable to repay.
</P>
<P>
Royal Bank of Scotland has already led the way by announcing a
12 million pounds (19.2 million US dollars) provision against bad
and doubtful loans in Thailand, though the final figure is
expected to be much higher.
</P>
<P>
Much larger write-offs are expected from other banks, including
the mighty HSBC which may write off up to 600 million pounds (960
million US dollars). Standard Chartered is looking at provisions
of at least 250 million pounds (400 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Other leading banks have yet to disclose how much they will
have to write off, but analysts believe it could be in the region
of 90 million pounds (144 million US dollars) for NatWest, 60
million pounds (96 million US dollars) for Barclays and 10 million
pounds (16 million US dollars) at Abbey National (one of Britain's
building societies).
</P>
<P>
One analyst said: "It is too soon to assess the full impact,
but a write-off of about 1 percent of exposure seems reasonable at
this stage."

DAR ES SALAAM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Participants in a
seminar on bad cultures and traditions have called for an end to
the practice of using chemical fertilizers as one of the
addictives in some breweries of Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Vows to Purge Pakistan of Corruption, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said today the country's constitutional crisis was
created out of petty issues and vowed "to rid the country of
corruption, terrorism and lawlessness."
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide TV and Radio broadcast here this evening,
Sharif, in power for nine months, said that "a stable government
has been plunged into an atmosphere of uncertainty owing to the
wishes of a few people."
</P>
<P>
The present crisis surfaced soon after a deterrent law was
passed by the Parliament to curb terrorism in the country, Sharif
said in his 25-minute speech, referring to the on-going power
tussle between the executive and the judiciary involving him and
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.
</P>
<P>
"The present uncertain conditions have nothing to do either
with problems of the people or with the integrity of the country,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that nothing could obstruct him from completing "my
mission to purge the society of its presents ills."
</P>
<P>
The economy which was put back on track from the brink of
bankruptcy, he stated, was losing one billion rupees (about 20
million U.S. dollars) everyday, adding that foreign exchange which
registered an improvement after his take over has again lost 200
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This was the greatest injustice to the 140 million people who
gave him the mandate to complete his mission," he said, noting
that undue hurdles have been created in the completion of his
mission.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, he will not allow the masses to fall victims
to conspiracies.
</P>
<P>
"It is my obligation to protect the country and its
constitution," he declared.

<HEADLINE> India's BJP Party Stakes Claim to Form Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Hindu nationalist party
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies today staked their
claim to form a government, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
After a 35-minute meeting with President Kocheril Raman
Narayanan here this evening, BJP President L.K. Advani, when asked
if the party had formally staked its claim, responded that "in a
way it can be called as staking claim."
</P>
<P>
Advani's response assumed significance because the BJP, the
largest party in the parliament, has been very cautious in staking
claim to form a government since the United Front government
collapsed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minority government led by Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral fell after the Congress party withdrew support to it over
an investigative report on the assassination of former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
Advani told reporters that President Narayanan had assured the
delegation of opposition parties that he would not take a "hasty"
decision and holding of fresh elections would be the last resort.
</P>
<P>
The BJP president said the formation of a majority government
in the present situation "does not seem to be feasible on paper"
but it could be possible after a realignment of political parties.
</P>
<P>
Apart from his meeting with the opposition parties, President
Narayanan is expected to meet leaders of the United Front and the
Congress party on Monday as part of his consultation efforts to
find a way out of the current political impasse in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party has claimed to form a coalition of its own
immediately after its withdrawal of support to the Gujral
government on Friday.

<HEADLINE> 42 Billion Dollars For UAE's Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates has
pumped more than 42 billion U.S. dollars over the past four years
to develop its economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a report today, the total sum includes both public
and private investments between 1993 to 1997. Investment in the
oil sector accounted for nearly one fifth of the total funding.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said that the funds invested in the oil sector
were used to maintain and develop existing onshore and offshore
oil fields to boost capacity and meet growing global crude demand.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the other capitals, estimated at some 33.6 billion
dollars, was invested in manufacturing, agriculture and public
service sectors to diversify the country's income resources, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's revenues are heavily reliant on oil earnings which
account for nearly two thirds of its total incomes each year.
</P>
<P>
The UAE government launched an economic diversification campaign
from early 1990 and has made "great achievements."

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif today accused the Presidency of not extending
cooperation in the parliament's efforts to preserve the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
In his televised address to the nation this evening, Prime
Minister Sharif said that the steps taken by the Presidency in the
recent days have revealed the real cause of the "hysterical
situation prevailing in the country."
</P>
<P>
Sharif took the nation into confidence on the persisting
constitutional crisis in the country arising out of unprecedented
factionalism in the Judiciary leading to a direct request by Chief
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah to the Army for security of the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government passed amendment in the contempt of
court law to steer Pakistan out of the further crisis but
President Farooq Leghari did not sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing bad in the law but it just gave right of
appeal to the aggrieved party," said Sharif, adding that "right of
appeal in superior court has been given against the verdict of
lower courts. Appeal against the Session Court could be filed in
the High Court and appeal in Supreme Court be filed against any
judgment of the High Court."
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that the amendment in the contempt of court law was
in accordance with Islamic principles and any civilized system.
</P>
<P>
"We had given the right to the court to decide on any appeal in
the contempt of court case. Crisis could be averted if the
president signed the bill. However, he refused to sign the law,
passed by the two houses of the parliament," He added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that "the situation is very unfortunate. The entire
country is in the grip of chaos."
</P>
<P>
He regretted that there is no assistance from the Presidency in
the government's move to save the parliament and constitution.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Decides to Defer Redeployment (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet decided
today to defer the second troop redeployment in the West Bank
until a ministerial committee formulates a final map on Israeli
interests and the Palestinian side fulfills its peace commitments.
</P>
<P>
A government statement issued after the weekly Cabinet meeting
said the cabinet, in a vote of 16 in favor and two abstentions,
decided in principle to carry out further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
But the extent and timetable for the second redeployment will
only be decided by a ministerial committee headed by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which will work out a picture of
Israeli interests on the final-status talks with the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The two abstained were Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy and
Education Minister Zevulun Hammer from the rightwing National
Religious Party which opposes any further troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The statement conditioned the implementation of further
redeployment on PNA's fulfillment of its commitments, including
completing the process of amending the Palestinian Covenant which
called for Israel's destruction, fighting terrorism and preventing
violence, and keeping the size of Palestinian police according to
the interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government urged the PNA to agree to hold the
final-status talks immediately in order to seek a final solution.
"The government believes the proper manner in which to advance the
peace process with the Palestinians is through immediately
entering negotiations regarding the final-status talks," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It noted Israel would soon determine its position on the final
settlement, including a map on various security areas,
settlements, water resources and Jewish historical sites. The map
will be decided by the ministerial committee which also includes
Foreign Minister David Levy, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said after today's meeting that
Israel will begin informing its decision on further redeployment
to other parties concerned with the peace process. Foreign
Minister Director-General Eiitan Bentsur was dispatched to Cairo
today to brief the Egyptian government on the decision.
</P>
<P>
The decision drew fierce criticism from Israel's opposition.
The opposition party Meretz responded with a decision to table a
non-confidence motion in the Kensset (parliament) tomorrow against
the government.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid said his party will not support
Netanyahu's "policy of deception" and only supports concrete
steps taken to advance the peace process.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
Leading opposition Labor party's lawmaker Yossi Beilin charged
the Netanyahu government of deferring the implementation of its
peace commitments. "They just want to satisfy the right, they
don't think either about the solution, about the peace process,
about the Palestinians, about the Americans or about the peace
camp in Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Labor faction head in the Knesset Rannan Cohen also accused
Netanyahu of "being held hostage by a handful of rightist
extremists" by avoiding decision-making on the further
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
PNA officials reacted angrily, accusing the Netanyahu
government of avoiding decision-making and trying to move away
from the peace process. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
dismissed the Israeli decision as "too vague, too little and much
too late."
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, PNA Minister of Higher Education, denounced the
Israeli move as a violation of all signed peace agreements.
"Actually, this is a non-starter, because obviously the Israeli
government is attempting to outmaneuver the Americans, the
international community, and the Palestinians, and try to deflect
the pressure and demands that Israel adhere to agreements," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, Netanyahu met strong opposition within his
hardline rightwing government to his efforts to win support for
his proposal on further redeployment. Today's cabinet decision was
apparently aimed at pleasing the hardliners and designed to show
the government unity on policies toward the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel's state television Channel I reported that with the
decision to go ahead with the redeployment, regardless the lack
of a date and extent, Netanyahu believed it will open the door for
a long-delayed summit with United States President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has been reportedly pressing heavily
on Netanyahu to carry out the redeployment in order to break the
stalemate in the peace process. To express his displeasure with
Israel's handling of the peace process, Clinton refused to meet
Netanyahu during the latter's visit to the U.S. early the
month.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Ahead of World AIDS
(Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) Day Monday, Israeli National
AIDS Steering Committee today held a seminar on AIDS at Kfar
Hamaccabiah in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, AIDS experts from all over the country
discussed new AIDS treatments, such as "cocktail," which was
introduced worldwide two years ago and makes AIDS more a chronic
disease than an acute one.
</P>
<P>
The experts also exchanged views on AIDS patients' rights; the
economic and social implications of the disease and the funds
raising for AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Israeli Health Ministry statistics, a
total of 467 Israelis have contracted full-fledged AIDS since
1981, and 89 of them are still alive and live in Israel.
</P>
<P>
There have also been 1,646 reported HIV carriers in Israel -
1,548 of them alive - but the actual number is estimated to be
twice that or more. The Human Immunedeficiency Virus causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 66 AIDS experts from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Turkey
and the Palestinian National Authority arrived in Jerusalem Friday
to attend a four-day conference in an attempt to find ways of
reducing the spread of AIDS in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Experts: New Output Ceiling Depresses Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The new output ceiling set
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will
depress crude oil prices on the international market to less than
18 U.S. dollars a barrel in 1998, experts here said today.
</P>
<P>
Ali Akber, marketing manager of the Abu Dhabi National Oil
Company (ADNOC), said that the output increase will deal a severe
blow to oil prices, which fluctuate around 18.5 dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
"I expect prices to be lower than the 18-dollar level next year
because the demand would likely keep unchanged while the supplies
increase," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is "not optimistic" about OPEC members'
earnings in 1998, because the production increase can not bring
them more profits due to "damaged prices."
</P>
<P>
The OPEC members on Saturday decided to increase their daily
output to a total of 27.5 million barrels, up 10 percent, or 2.5
million barrels from existing oil production quota.
</P>
<P>
Some other experts, however, said that the new quota would
improve the competitive capabilities of OPEC members in the world
oil market.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the new ceiling will impose negative effects on
crude (oil) prices, but on the other hand, it will make OPEC more
influential in the market," they claimed.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the Gulf region that form the core of the
organization, have expressed satisfaction with the decision, which
they hope will restore credibility of the OPEC in world oil market.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC includes 12 members of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq,
Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Indonesia,
Nigeria, Libya, Algeria and Gabon.

JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National

agreement under which Germany will finance several development
projects in the PNA territories.
</P>
<P>
PNA Finance Minister Mohammed Zuhdi Nashashebi and visiting
German State Minister of Economy and Development Luther Klem
signed the agreement in the presence of PNA Chairman Yasser
Arafat, according to the Palestinian news service JMCC.
</P>
<P>
German representative to the PNA Horst Fretig, who also
attended the signing ceremony, has called on Israel to implement
the second-stage troop redeployment from the West Bank under
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of opening a safe passage route
linking the West Bank and Gaza Strip, lifting closure Israel
imposed on the PNA territories, and removing Israeli "roadblocks"
to international assistance, economic and infrastructure projects
to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
He called for the implementation of signed agreements
concerning the peace process and the parties concerned not to
take any measure that would have a negative impact on the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said Germany holds that the settlement activities are the
main obstacle to the peace process and which are against the
international law.

talks at the presidential residence Rus outside Moscow, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations Yeltsin and Kohl agreed to hold annual
top-level meetings with key ministers taking part.

<P>
They considered the ways of setting up three-sided
consultations involving Russia, France and Germany in line with

Yekaterinburg, Russia, in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the two leaders discussed the training way for
young Russian managers in Germany in keeping with a recent
initiative by Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed a joint project for creating a European
military transport plane on the basis of AN-70 aircraft, and said
that experts would start consultations on the project in Berlin in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Among international issues, the leaders highlighted the
situation in the Middle East, voicing anxiety over the lack of
progress in Israeli-Palestinian relations, the report said.
</P>

Kohl spoke highly of the actions of Yeltsin and Russian
diplomats toward resolving the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was earlier reported that Moscow is concerned with
"underdevelopment" of economic contacts between the two states "as
compared with the level of their political cooperation," according
to Russian presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Kohl met one day before Russia's partnership and
cooperation agreement with the European Union takes effect.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Russia Sign Accord Under Offset Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Institute of
Scientific Research today signed an agreement with Russia's arms
manufacturer Rosvoorouzhenie Company and Center of Higher
Education Inventions within the framework of Kuwaiti Offset
Program.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Kuwaiti institute Abdel Hadi Al-Otaibi said the
agreement is aimed at financing joint research projects, obtaining
up-to-date Russian industrial and oil technologies.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is also for training special experts, swapping
expertise and contacting with Russian information centers.
</P>
<P>
Alexandre N. Souvor, who signed the agreement on behalf of the
Rosvoorouzhenie Company, said the Russian Center of Higher
Education Inventions would supply the Kuwaiti institute with
modern scientific technology.
</P>

Russian ambassador to Kuwait Piotr Stegny described the
agreement as a crucial step in the scientific and technological
cooperation between the two countries.

<P>
Under Kuwait's Offset Program starting from 1992, foreign arms
suppliers are required to invest, in the Gulf emirate or its
ventures abroad, 30 percent of the value of any contract worth
more than 1 million Kuwaiti dinars (about 3.3 million
U.S. dollars) awarded to them.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, a total of 17 foreign companies,
almost exclusively defense companies, have signed offset
agreements with Kuwait. The U.S., France and Britain also have
offset projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has received investment obligations of up to 1.3 billion
dollars under the program, but only a small fraction has
materialized.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Science and
Technology Commission has said that land degradation could be the
cause for the loss of 10 percent of the national cattle herd by
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Commissioner Asrat
Bulbula said here Saturday at the International Livestock
Research Institute that the problem resulted in a loss of
livestock equivalent to one million tropical livestock units (250
million kilograms)in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Unless arrested, the figure may rise to two million units some
13 years later, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"For the resource-poor rural land users, environmental
implications will mean nothing unless there are alternatives for
sustainable livelihoods," the commissioner noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that livestock development strategies should be
re-oriented toward better use of local resources and contribute
effectively to food security.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is the biggest animal husbandry nation in Africa
with a total of 130 million domestic animals including 27 million
cattles.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Orphans to Reach 620,000 in Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Around 620,000 children
in Ethiopia could become orphans in the coming two years as a
result of the AIDS virus and the number may well reach 1.3
million by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Vice-Minister of Health Lamisso Hayesso said in a
statement to observe this year's world AIDS campaign which falls
on December 1.
</P>
<P>
Hayesso said a total of 1.7 million AIDS patients were
reported last year while the World Health Organization estimated
the number to be 8.4 million worldwide during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In the situation in Ethiopia, the vice-minister said, AIDS is
spreading at an alarming rate both in the rural and urban areas
and that it will grow even more serious unless strict measures
are taken without delay to counter the menace.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the campaign will be the youth and children under
the age of 18, he said. The campaign aims at reducing
the spread of the disease, providing patients with better care
and medical service and raising public awareness against the
disease, he added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 19,433 AIDS cases were reported to the Ethiopian
Health Ministry in July 1995. The actual number of AIDS
patients, however, was estimated by the ministry to be 350,000.
In 1996, the number of people infected with the HIV-virus was
estimated to be 1.7 million.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Current Account Deficit Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Canada's current account deficit
rose sharply to 6.4 billion dollars (4.5 billion US dollars) in
the third quarter, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
The enlarged deficit was largely the result of decreasing
surplus on trade in goods, the federal statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus fell to 3.7 billion dollars in the third
quarter of 1997 from a peak of 11.7 billion dollars in the second
quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, the country's trade surplus fell by 2.1
billion dollars, as imports kept climbing for a fifth consecutive
quarter, rising by a substantial 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, higher profits of Canadian affiliates of
foreign owned companies also contributed to the current account
deficit, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies, mainly U.S.-owned, invested 5.0 billion
dollars of direct investment in Canada, their second largest
investment on record.
</P>
<P>
Foreign portfolio investors also bought record Canadian
securities. In the third quarter, they purchased 12.6 billion of
Canadian securities, their fourth largest investment on record.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, IMF Bailout Talks Stalled on Key Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Talks between South Korea and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the terms of an IMF rescue
package were stalled on differences over the economic growth rate
and the fate of troubled financial institutions in the Asian
nation.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Ministry of Finance and Economy announced early
today that the ministry and the visiting IMF delegation have
reached a provisional agreement on terms for an emergency bailout
package.
</P>
<P>
Finance and Economy Minister Lim Chang-yuel and IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus, however, were not successful in
negotiating the detailed terms of the bailout loan over the phone
later today.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who is attending a meeting of finance ministers of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and six other
nations in Kuala Lumpur, flatly denied the South Korean assertion
on a package settlement, according to South Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
In their phone discussions, Camdessus insisted that South Korea
should lower its economic growth rate next year to less than 2.5
percent from the initially-set 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Lim called for a minimum expansion of 3 percent, citing
concerns over high unemployment and other damaging effects, a
ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government is also reluctant to accept an IMF
demand for the immediate shutdown of heavily-indebted banks and
merchant banks.
</P>
<P>
Seoul asked the IMF for three to six months to resolve the
ailing banks' problems in accordance with its own program unveiled
in November.
</P>
<P>
Seoul officials fear that a gross domestic product growth of
2.5 percent and the resulting belt-tightening would sharply raise
the nation's jobless rate leading to overall social unrest.
</P>
<P>
Except for these differences, South Korea and the IMF have
reportedly reached a consensus over other macroeconomic goals, the
ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to slash South Korea's 1998 current
account deficit of 5 billion U.S. dollars from this year's
projected 13 billion dollars, they said.
</P>
<P>
Other agreed conditions included an increase of the value added
tax from the present 10 percent to 11 percent, a cut of about 7.5
billion dollars in next year's government spending and a decrease
of the annual monetary growth rate from the current 18 percent to
10 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lim Chang-yuel notified the IMF delegation this
afternoon that they are prepared to start anew on a bailout
package on the knotty issues to reach a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the South Korean government is likely to accept
some of the IMF's demands on the urgently needed bailout should
the talks reach a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus told reporters in Kuala Lumpur that the South Koreans
have good reasons to accept the IMF demands since they are in the
interests of their country.
</P>
<P>
The top IMF official said he was hopeful that the discussions
would be concluded this week.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the IMF and South Korea reach the final accord on
the multibillion dollar rescue package, the first installment of
the bailout loan, estimated at about 10 billion dollars, will
arrive in Seoul, ministry officials said.

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Points To Need For Democratic System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a member of
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, has said that a democratic
system needs to be built in rural areas to promote openness.
</P>
<P>
Wei made the remark during an inspection tour of north China's
Hebei province from November 25 to December 1, where he asked village
cadres to make government affairs accessible to the public and
supervised by Party members and farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said that greater openness can help build a democratic
system and increase the cadres' sense of responsibility. Many
problems have been solved and social stability established when
the method has been used in some villages, he said.
</P>
<P>
Village affairs include managing the budget, birth control,
electrical power fees, and grain purchases. Every Chinese village
has a grass-roots government to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that if villagers can supervise political affairs in
their own village, then a clean government can be built,
corruption an be stopped, and the Party's style be improved.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the method reflects a decision on
increasing democracy at the grass-roots level made at the 15th
Party Congress held in last September, and that farmers, who
account for more than 80 percent of the Chinese population, are
its base and that the modernization drive can continue if their
enthusiasm is brought into play.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese provinces have adopted the policy of openness in
their villages and Hebei province is one that has done well in
it.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Press freedom, a concern of
people before handover, still prevails in Hong Kong after July 1,
Administrative Secretary Anson Chan told a press seminar here
today.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 media practitioners and academics from China's interior
 areas, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan were here attending the
professional meeting.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the seminar this evening,
Chan said that there has been no change in the operation of the
local media sector since July 1.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the free flow of information as critical to both
political and economic and trade development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Without it (free flow of information), Hong Kong's competitive
edge as a cosmopolitan will be diminished and its reputation as a
regional information center damaged, she warned.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Chan affirmed, protecting and pushing forward
press freedom is a steadfast policy of the Special Administrative
Region government.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time for the seminar to be held in Hong Kong.
The first was held four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Topics to be discussed in the following two days include
balance between press freedom and social responsibilities, media
exchange between the four places in recent years and a review of
media coverage of the handover.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong News Executives' Association played host to the
seminar.

<HEADLINE> Pak Presidential Spokesman Describes PM's Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's presidential
spokesman said today that it is "most unfortunate" that Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif has chosen to accuse the president of
conspiring against the government, particularly in matters before
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Sharif's televised speech to the nation last
night, the spokesman said the people of Pakistan know that
President Farooq Leghari has always held the judiciary in the
highest esteem and consistently fought to respect, protect and
enhance its independence and sanctity.
</P>
<P>
"The President has assiduously followed the constitution and
law at all times. In deed, the president has worked hard to try
and help the government extricate itself from a self-created
mess," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He explained that President Leghari did not think it
appropriate to offer further comments on the prime minister's
speech at this time when efforts are being made to reunite the
Supreme Court and redress the damage done to it in recent days.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the nation last night, Prime Minister Sharif
openly accused President Leghari of not extending cooperation in
the parliament's efforts to preserve the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was referring to Leghari's refusal to sign the amendment
to the contempt of court Law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the steps taken by the president in recent days
have revealed the real cause of the "hysterical situation
prevailing in the country."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that his government passed an
amendment to the contempt of court law to steer Pakistan out of
further crisis but President Leghari did not sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
The two houses of Parliament passed the bill on November 18.
The bill was forwarded to the president on the same day for his
assent. Under the Constitution, the president has a maximum of 30
days to sign it.

<HEADLINE> People Should Learn from Mao Zedong's Reading Habit: Li Ruihuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, told members of a forum on the
book "Twenty Four Histories with Mao Zedong's Comments" here today
that the Chinese people should learn from the late Chairman's
reading habit.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mao's habit of reading history books and learning
from the past should be continued, and that the Chinese should
read more books in a diligent way.
</P>
<P>
The book is perhaps the most famous history book in China. It
is a record of Chinese history going back 5,000 years, written by
many authors in different dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The book was a favorite of many emperors and Mao himself liked
it very much and read it during wartime and during periods of
illness. He wrote notes and comments on almost every page his copy.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Mao's great historical deeds are not only the
result of his understanding of China and analysis of Chinese
society, but also of his study of Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Mao was good at summing up historical experience and using
history as a mirror, Li said, and using all this, Mao created a
new history. Mao was a man who combined historical knowledge with
reality, and solved various modern problems, Li said. He then
recalled Deng Xiaoping's remarks about "opening up the future by
summarizing history" and President Jiang Zemin's statement that
"the whole Party should study history".
</P>
<P>
"In re-examing Mao's practice, we feel again the great charm and
vigor of Chinese civilization, which inspires us to continue the
fine traditional culture and build a socialist culture with
Chinese characteristics," Li concluded.

BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, speaking at the opening of the
Fifth Executive Meeting of the Seventh Committee of the All-China
Women's Federation in Beijing today, that women should hold the
banner of Deng Xiaoping high.
</P>
<P>
He said that women's organizations should use Deng Xiaoping
Theory for women's problems to make a contribution to building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and that the scope of the
federation's has become wider and its responsibility greater than
before.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women "hold up half the sky" and their social
status has gotten better with each passing year, but they still
face many problems in the 1990s, such as unemployment and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Hu went on say that the women's federation should do three
things: First, arouse women to get them involved in a high-profile
program developing agriculture by using science and technology;
second, help unemployed female workers find new jobs; and third,
promote good morale in families.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the federation's goal is to serve women completely,
Hu said it must rely on women entirely, and that workers must go
to the grass-roots level to solve major problems.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) and

<HEADLINE> EU to Step Up Prevention Against Aids: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior European Union
official today said that prevention is still the only real way to
fight against aids.
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, European commissioner in charge of employment
and social affairs including public health, said on this World
Aids Day, "No effort should be spared in the fight against this
scourge and prevention is still the only real way of acting on the
international front."
</P>
<P>
Treatment is bringing real improvement in Europe and in the
industrialized countries but it would be a mistake not to keep up
the effort with regard to behavioral patterns and prevention, said
the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The European Union currently has some 500,000 HIV-infected
people and over 180,000 cases of full-blown aids disease have been
reported since the onset of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Three-quarters of the European cases were reported by Spain,
France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
According to recent reports published by the European
Commission, the UNAIDS and the World Bank, there are at least 30
million people in the world who are infected with the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of these people live in the developing
countries with two thirds of these people in sub-Saharan Africa.

SEOUL -- Talks between South Korea and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) on the terms of an IMF rescue package were
stalled on differences over the economic growth rate and the fate
of troubled financial institutions in the Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Ministry of Finance and Economy announced early
today that the ministry and the visiting IMF delegation have
reached a provisional agreement on terms for an emergency bailout
package.
</P>
<P>
Finance and Economy Minister Lim Chang-yuel and IMF Managing
Director Michel Camdessus, however, were not successful in
negotiating the detailed terms of the bailout loan over the phone
later today.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said today it will
provide a quick-disbursing emergency loan of up to 4 billion
U.S. dollars for South Korea's economic stabilization program and
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
PHNOM PENH -- More than 10 Cambodian politicians, who have been
exiled since last July, today returned to the country from Thai
capital of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The politicians, who were greeted at the airport by Lakhan
Mehotra, special envoy of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, were all members of the Union of Cambodian Democrats, which
is made up of the PUNCINPEC, Khmer Buddhist Liberal Democratic
Party, Khmer Nation Party and Khmer Neutral Party.
</P>
<P>
Their purpose of coming back was to pave the way for ousted
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and some other exiled politicians to
return to the country safely and participate in the next year's
national election, they said.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen ousted his rival Ranariddh, then
first prime minister, on July 6 after a weekend of fighting
between troops loyal to the two men. Ranariddh has been exiled
since then.
</P>
<P>
ISLAMABAD -- A special meeting of the Federal Cabinet chaired
by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was held today to discuss the
prevailing constitutional crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said that the meeting continued for about
three hours. However, no further details were immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of the Army Staff General Jehangir Karamat
today spent two hours with President Farooq Leghari at the
Presidential House and discussed with him the present
constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
The sources did not disclose any details of the meeting.
However, the source confirmed that the Chief of the Army Staff was
with the President for two hours.

<HEADLINE> EU to Cut Funds in Some Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) may
cut its funds in some regions after 1999 but the cut has nothing
to do with its envisaged enlargement toward eastern and central
Europe, an EU spokeswoman said today.
</P>
<P>
The cut was only due to the fact that these regions have passed
the 75-percent EU funding threshold and "has nothing to do with
enlargement," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the latest available figures published by the Eurostat,
regions qualifying for the objective one status, the highest
category for assistance from EU structural funds, must have
per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) at 75 percent of the EU
average or less, she said.
</P>
<P>
The regions to lose their objective one status may include
Lisbon in Portugal, Valencia in Spain, Corsica and Valenciennois
in France, Sardinia and Puglia in Italy, Hainaut in Belgium,
Flevoland in the Netherlands and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The future of EU regional aid is causing intense concern across
EU member states. The European Commission announced outline plans
as part of its Agenda 2000 budget proposals last July, but so far
regions are still not sure what their fate will be.
</P>
<P>
The European Council of Ministers is expected to make a
decision later next year after the statistics on which the
structural funds for 2000-2006 are to be based will be finalized.
</P>
<P>
Under Agenda 2000, the commission proposes to maintain
structural spending at 0.46 percent of the EU's GDP, or 275
billion ECUs (305 billion U.S. dollars) between 2000 and 2006.

<HEADLINE> Housing Remains Top Concern of HK People: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Housing-related problems
continued to top the list of most often mentioned issues affecting
Hong Kong people, according to a bimonthly survey conducted by the
Home Affairs Bureau (HAB).
</P>
<P>
Conducted between November 10 and 14, the survey found that 62
percent of the 1,526 respondents considered housing-related
problems their biggest concern, down one percentage point from
the September survey.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who felt that the government had handled
the problem well remained relatively unchanged at 14 percent,
while 68 percent considered that the government had exerted effort
in solving this top concern.
</P>
<P>
Economy-related problems were the second major concern of the
respondents, being mentioned by 29 percent of them, up from 12
percent in the last survey.
</P>
<P>
Among this group of people, 32 percent were worried about
inflation and the high cost of living, while another 25 percent
said fluctuations in the stock markets had affected them.
</P>
<P>
An HAB spokesman said that this could partly be explained by
the sharp fluctuations in the stock market in the last two weeks
of October.
</P>
<P>
However, the unease that some people felt was quickly mitigated
by the government's steadfast position to protect the Hong Kong
dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that confidence in the local economy was
substantially restored by the international community's positive
assessment of the local government's handling of the difficulties
affecting the stock market and banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The survey, seventy-third in the series, also revealed that
Hong Kong's future as a problem was mentioned only by 5 percent of
the respondents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 64 percent of people expected the existing situation
to improve or remain unchanged in the coming 12 months. 70 percent
said they were satisfied with the present situation and 72 percent
said they were confident that Hong Kong would continue to be
prosperous and stable.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Welcomes Heritage Foundation's Announcement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Administrative Secretary
Anson Chan today welcomed the announcement of the Heritage
Foundation which ranked Hong Kong the freest economy of the world
for the fourth year in a row.
</P>
<P>
"I very much welcome the announcement...There is even more to
savor in this accolade for us, as it comes so soon after the
establishment of Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region
(SAR) of the People's Republic of China," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1998 Index of Economic Freedom published here
earlier today by the foundation, Hong Kong's return to China has
done nothing to alter its status as the world's most open setting
in which to pursue economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The study "reminds us all once again about the fundamentals of
our economic faith," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Above all, it recognizes that Hong Kong's economic structure
remains unchanged after the handover, as has been promised in the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and promulgated in the Basic Law,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
The head of 180,000-strong Hong Kong civil service expressed
her confidence in the local economy, as well as the Asian economy
as a whole, despite events in the past several months.
</P>
<P>
Chan pointed out that "there were a number of critical points"
that arose from the SAR government's recent experience in dealing
with stock and currency market fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, we demonstrate beyond doubt our political will to
defend the HK/U.S. dollar link," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Secondly, we showed that we have the mechanism and resources
to mount that defense, and sophisticated, effective and determined
officials to execute it," and thirdly, the community has faith in
the peg, she noted.
</P>
<P>
"Fourthly, and perhaps most significantly, the leadership in
Beijing has demonstrated in the most powerful and public way that
they respect Hong Kong's autonomy in running its own affairs,"
Chan pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She added that the moderate adjustments to the property and
equity markets following speculators' attack on the Hong Kong
dollar will make Hong Kong economy even more competitive.

<HEADLINE> EU-Russia Partnership Agreement Hailed As Historic Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
hailed its Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia,
which went into effect today, as a historic event.
</P>
<P>
The event marks a qualitatively new stage in relations between
the union and Russia, said a statement issued by Luxembourg, which
is serving as the six-month rotating presidency of the 15-nation
union.
</P>
<P>
With the agreement, which will be renewable annually after 10
years, the union is establishing with Russia a mutually beneficial
partnership of trust that will help consolidate the process of
democratic and economic reforms, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also marks the integration of Russia into the
European family and constitutes an instrument through which the union
and Russia can together consolidate peace, stability and security on
the European continent.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed in June 1994, covers various aspects
between the two sides including trade, science and technology and
education.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Russia will grant most-favored-nation status
to EU companies established in the country and the MFN status will
help loosen quantitative restrictions on imports from the EU and
ensure easier access to Russia's service market.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, EU commissioner responsible for external
relations with central and eastern Europe, said the agreement is a
positive affirmation of the evolving relationship between the EU
and Russia and reflects the growing importance the union attaches
to improving and deepening partnership and cooperation with the
country.
</P>
<P>
The EU considers Russia as one of its important trading
partners. In 1996, 40 percent of Russian exports, worth 22 billion
ECUs (26 billion U.S. dollars), went to the EU; 38 percent of EU's
exports, worth 19 billion ECUs (23 billion dollars), went to
Russia.

<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Rewi Alley Memorial
Co-operative Foundation held a ceremony here today for the 100th
anniversary of the birth of the New Zealand social activist, Rewi
Alley, tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Rewi Alley came to China in 1927 and lived in Beijing until his
death in 1987. Along with other foreigners and patriotic Chinese,
he started the Gung Ho Movement in Shanghai in 1937, at the
beginning of the Chinese People's War of Resistance against
Japanese Aggression.
</P>
<P>
He later served as general-manager of the Association of
Chinese Industrial Co-operatives, set up in Wuhan in 1938. The
more than 3,000 co-operatives across China provided much-needed
uniforms, blankets, arms, and ammunition for soldiers at the front.
</P>
<P>
At Alley's suggestion, the Association of Chinese Industrial
Co-operatives resumed activities in 1983, after some 30 years of
inactivity, and established more than 200 industrial co-operatives
promoting the growth of the socialist economy of China.
</P>
<P>
Yang Bo, president of the Rewi Alley Foundation, said at the
ceremony that the event is held to award outstanding co-operatives
and individuals to promote further development of the Gung Ho
Movement.

have crossed the border and entered northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the refugees belong to Latugu tribe, and most
of them are women, children and old people, "The monitor"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
They were settled in Achopli and Kiryandongo refugees camps in
Kitgan district, according to the paper.
</P>

The refugees said they left their homes in south Sudan to
avoid a conflicts between the Sudan People's Liberation Army

</P>
<P>
The SPLA took up arms in 1983 to fight for self-determination
in the Christian south. Recent talks between the two sides in
Nairobi, Kenya failed to produce results as the SPLA insisted on
having a confederation with the Islamic north, rejecting
Khartoum's offer for federation.
</P>
<P>
A famine has occurred in southern Sudan right now and this has
weakened the fighting capacity of the SPLA, they held.

Zhang said that the PLA should introduce an effective
management system for weapons and equipment to improve the army's
combat capability, and different departments and personnel need to

<HEADLINE> US's Northwest Airlines Helps Chinese Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Northwest Airlines of the
United States recently helped three Chinese children who were
suffering from heart disease, whose parents could not afford an
operation, by providing them and their parents with free tickets
to go for treatment in the US, according to the airline's Beijing
representative.
</P>
<P>
The parents of the three children, from Jiangxi and Hainan
provinces, and Beijing, came to Northwest seeking help after they
had heard about assistance the airline has given in the past.
</P>
<P>
Nine Chinese children have received similar assistance from the
airline. In August, the local media told the story of Wan
Zhaojiang, a two year-old who had just returned from a
Northwest-sponsored trip. Wan's given name of Zhaojiang was
changed to Xibei (or 'Northwest' in Chinese)" after the child was
operated on in the US.
</P>
<P>
Northwest started its Asian flights in 1947. To celebrate the
50th anniversary of its services in Asia, the airlines became
involved in a number of charitable activities in China, which
included a Children's art show, a 55,000-yuan donation to help
girls who had dropped out of primary schools in the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, and free tickets to help eight universities and
hospitals in Beijing and Shanghai send 16 researchers to the
United States.

<HEADLINE> EU Outpaces Japan, U.S. in Industrial Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- For the fourth consecutive
month the European Union (EU) has outperformed Japan and the
United States in industrial growth, the Eurostat said in a report
released today.
</P>
<P>
During the three months from June to August this year, the
industrial production in the 15-nation union increased by 1.2
percent. Comparable rates in Japan and the United States were 0.8
percent and 1.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the EU, Japan and the United States all
registered a growth rate of 1.3 percent, the Luxembourg-based
statistical agency said in the report.
</P>
<P>
While Japan and the United States experienced a drop the
following months, the union retained constant growth. The EU
increased 0.1 percentage point in May.
</P>
<P>
Finland scored the highest growth among EU member states that
posted above-average increases. It had a growth rate of 2.7
percent. Spain scored a 2.2-percent growth while Luxembourg and
Sweden were both up by 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Denmark was also above the average growth rate with a
1.5-percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Countries registering lower-than-average growth rates were
Britain with 0.9 percent, Germany with 0.8 percent, the
Netherlands with 0.5 percent, and Greece with 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The EU's industrial production growth is attributed by Eurostat
to an economic recovery that is being led by the capital and
intermediate goods sectors.

<HEADLINE> Economy Books Tap Hong Kong's Success Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A set of seven books on Hong
Kong's economic policy was published here today, with an aim to
tell what is behind Hong Kong's success story and what can be
done for its continued success.
</P>
<P>
The seven books, as part of the 30-volume Hong Kong Economic
Policy Studies Series, were launched here today at a seminar
titled "Rethinking Economic Policies of Hong Kong", where authors
summed up their research findings.
</P>
<P>
The books focus on a variety of topical economic issues,
covering tourism, telecommunications, health care, labor, town
planning, housing, and water.
</P>
<P>
At today's seminar, the authors suggested that the Special
Administrative Region (SAR) government take a hands-off approach
to the economy, and let the market make decisions. They shared the
view that Hong Kong weathered the recent currency turmoil
sweeping Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's economic fundamentals are good though we are in a
business cycle of down string after so many years of rapid
growth," said Professor Richard Wong, director of the Hong Kong
Center for Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sharp fall on stock and property markets was
not the end of Hong Kong. "Good trend will not eliminate
frustrations," Wong was upbeat about Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
The economic research center coordinates the research projects
and writing of the series of books. The first batch of seven books
came to the shelves of book stores in April, and more will be put
out next year.

China's inland areas and Hong Kong opened here today.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day seminar, scientists both from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and the China Association (HK) for Science and

good prospects, said Yi Xunyan, visiting vice-president of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Typhoons in Western North Pacific to Take Asian Names from 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- From the year 2000 on,
typhoons in the western North Pacific will adopt Asian names, a
leading official of the Hong Kong Observatory announced here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Typhoon Committee of the Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific/World Meteorological Organization,
established in 1968, decided at its week-long 30th Session closing
here on Sunday to end the current use of American names, Lam Hing
Kwan, director of the Hong Kong Observatory and new chairman of
the Committee, said here today.
</P>
<P>
A special working group has been assigned the task of looking
into the details of implementation of the decision. The new naming
system is expected to put into operation in the year 2000, he said
at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Currently, press and electronic media in some places in the
region use names given by the Guam-based U.S. military Joint
Typhoon Warning Center.
</P>
<P>
And for many years, the Typhoon Committee has been using a
numbering system to label the typhoons. The Committee, with
members from almost all the places affected by typhoons, thought
that a regionally agreed naming system should be set up for use in
the region.
</P>
<P>
As typhoons refer to tropical cyclones affecting many places in
East Asia, the committee members believed that the use of Asian
names would enhance the alertness of the people to approaching
typhoons, thus making warnings more effective, Lam said.
</P>
<P>
The committee members pledged to step up their cooperative
efforts to monitor atmospheric and hydrological conditions in the
region and to exchange speedily information among themselves, so
as to be in a better position to advise their respective
governments about the regional impacts of El Nino and any other
phenomena of similar time and space scales in the future.

Fund (IMF) on the policy and other measures to stabilize the

</P>
<P>
The ADB's assistance will support South Korea's program of
economic stabilization and structural reforms, particularly in the
financial sector, the bank said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will soon discuss with South Korea policy measures
designed to overcome the balance of payments difficulties
currently facing the country.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said that it firmly believes its assistance, along with
those of other international financial institutions, will
contribute greatly to restoring investors' confidence in the South
Korean economy.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Are Becoming Aware of AIDS Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The fact that several hundred
people in Beijing volunteered to have HIV/AIDS tests this year
shows a rise in the residents' awareness of the deadly disease,
according to Prof. Hu Xianghu of the Beijing Municipal Institute
of STD and AIDS (Sexually-Transmitted Diseases and Acquired Immuno
Deficiency Syndrome).
</P>
<P>
Through November of this year, the municipality found 35
HIV/AIDS cases, 18 of which were contracted by local residents,
raising the number of local HIV/AIDS patients to 55, Prof. Hu
said, and indicating a growing threat among local people.
</P>
<P>
Hu suggests that awareness of the means of transmission,
including contact with tainted blood, sexual contact, and parental
transmission, should be increased among the public.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a publicity and awareness campaign on HIV/AIDS
prevention is being carried out in Yunnan province in the
Southwest China, where 56 percent of the country's cases have been
reported.
</P>
<P>
A healthy life-style, mainly avoiding the use of drugs, is
being promoted among rural people and the young, because 91
percent of the HIV/AIDS cases were caused by contaminated
needles.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, 4,678 HIV/AIDS cases have been
reported in the province, 55 percent of them in rural areas, and
46 percent among ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has had an education project in some ethnic
villages since 1991, with the help of the Yunnan Provincial
government. More than 80 percent of the people living in the
target areas have learned the basics of AIDS awareness, compared
with fewer than 20 percent previously.
</P>
<P>
Training courses on HIV/AIDS prevention have been held in 26
areas on the Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar borders, where AIDS is
prevalent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, teachers at primary and middle schools have also been
involved in health education programs to guarantee a safer life
for their students, and to keep them from contracting AIDS, local
health officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The prevalence of
AIDS/HIV in South Africa's armed forces is increasing by eight
percent every year, The Star newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers speaking at the recent launch of the Southern
African Civil Military Alliance, part of a worldwide network,
said it was plausible that, given the spread of the disease, up
to eight percent of South African National Defense Force
personnel are infected every year.
</P>
<P>
No overall figure for the incidence of the disease in the
military has been disclosed, but one regiment has been blamed for
the spread of HIV to remote communities in Kwazulu-Natal and the
Northern Cape provinces.
</P>
<P>
It is known that the military has higher sexually transmitted
infection rates than the general population.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said the AIDS/HIV epidemic in southern African is
more serious than in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
While data was difficult to obtain from military forces, it
had been established that in Zimbabwe, 50 percent of soldiers
were HIV infected, in the Central African Republic, 22 percent of
recruits were HIV positive, and in Congo, a total of 63 percent
of Deaths of soldiers in its armed forces were caused by AIDS or
HIV infection, rather than through bullet wounds or other causes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Health Officials Say Children Need HIV Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Health officials and HIV/AIDS
control experts say that early prevention of HIV infections in
Chinese children is needed, even if there are few infections now.
</P>
<P>
About 10 percent of the 8,277 cases of HIV infections reported
in China by the end of September were in people below the age of
18, according to Health Minister Chen Minzhang, who said that most
of the cases were the result of drug use, usually in sharing
contaminated needles.
</P>
<P>
"Children in our country also face the dreary situation of HIV
infections," Chen said, pointing out that drug use is the result
of "ignorance and curiosity".
</P>
<P>
Illegal activities that some young people may get involved in
make them vulnerable to HIV infection by sexual transmission,
Chen said today at a meeting for World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
"We should give adolescents enough knowledge about AIDS
prevention as early as possible through community, school, and
family efforts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Health Ministry officials say they are planning to join family
planning and women's health departments to provide more
information.
</P>
<P>
One State Education Commission official said that information
about HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has become
part of a compulsory health education program for middle school
and college students.
</P>
<P>
"We've asked middle schools to make students aware of sex,
HIV/AIDS, and STDs. Universities and colleges are also required to
improve sex ethics education," Zhang Xin, who is in charge of
hygiene and health education, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the colleges and universities are doing this job, and
we plan to conduct the same activities in middle schools gradually,"
she said.

JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Israeli activists
marked the World AIDS day here today with a demonstration to
protest the Treasury's refusal to cover the costs of the drug that
slows the progress of the HIV virus.

Organized by the Israel Coalition of AIDS (Acquired Immune

medication in health basket.

in the country would get the medications, including the drug
"cocktail" that slows the progress of the HIV (Human
Immuno-Deficiency Virus), one of the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Yehoshua Metza told the parliament session
today that the costs of AIDS drug should be included in the basket
of health services.
</P>
<P>
Although the drug "cocktail" is expensive, he said,
hospitalizing AIDS patients without giving them the "cocktail" is
even more costly.
</P>
<P>
The "cocktail" and other anti-AIDS drugs have reportedly cut
the mortality rate from the fatal disease by 20 percent in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman has said he will include the
AIDS "cocktail" in the basket of health services provided that
other medications are removed from it.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry spends about 2.4 million U.S. dollars a
year in fighting AIDS. This sum of money was spent on information
campaigns and blood testing but not on hospitalization of
patients and the operation of an AIDS hospice.
</P>
<P>
A survey, conducted shortly before this year's World AIDS day
by Israel representative of condom manufacturer Durex, found that
85 percent of Israelis who have sex with new partners do not use
condom.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest Health Ministry statistics, a total of
467 Israelis have contracted full-fledged AIDS since 1981, and
only 89 of them are still alive.
</P>
<P>
There also have been 1,646 HIV carriers. But actual numbers are
estimated to be twice of that or more, Health Ministry
said.

geostationary meteorology satellite officially went into operation
for the China Meteorology Satellite Center today, after 160 days
of trial operation.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, state councillor and minister in charge of the State
Science and Technology Commission, said at a ceremony that the
FY-2 is a product of Chinese high technolgy, and that the
successful design proves that China can develop its own high
technology by itself.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sub-Saharan Africa Suffers Most From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa is the
region with the fastest-moving AIDS epidemic and already home of
two-thirds of HIV carriers in the world, according to a U.N.
report available here today, the World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
People infected with HIV now make up 7.4 percent of all those
aged between 15 and 49 in the region, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Unprotected sex between men and women accounted for most of
the 3.4 million new HIV infections estimated among adults in
sub-Saharan Africa this year. This accounted for 58.6 percent of
the new HIV infections all over the world this year.
</P>
<P>
High fertility combined with poor access to information and
services for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission
resulted in some 530,000 infected children being born to mothers
with HIV in the region, making up some 90 percent in the world.
</P>
<P>
In general, western Africa sees its rates of infection
stabilize at much lower levels than in eastern and southern
Africa while southern Africa continues to be part of the
continent worst hit by the fatal disease, said the report.
</P>
<P>
By early 1997, the South African government estimated that 2.4
million people in the country were living with HIV, up by more
than one third over 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Botswana, the proportion of the adult population infected
with HIV has doubled over the last five years. Up to 43 percent
of pregnant women tested in the major urban center of Francistown
were HIV-positive in 1997.
</P>
<P>
HIV infection was estimated at one in five adults in Zimbabwe
in 1996. In capital Harare, 32 percent of pregnant women were
already infected with the virus in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Beitbridge, another major city in Zimbabwe, the proportion
shot up from 32 percent in 1995 to 59 percent last year. Although
levels in cities were slightly higher than in rural areas, the
difference was not great, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The disease has already killed 230,000 Kenyans while about 1.3
million are said to be HIV positive in the country. It is
expected that about one million Kenyans may die of AIDS by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Official data also indicated that as many as 2.2 million
people are currently living with HIV in Nigeria, a country whose
response to the epidemic needs strengthening, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5.8 million people were newly infected with HIV
this year, adding the number of HIV-carriers in the world to more
than 30 million, including 1.1 million children under age 15.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that an estimated 2.3 million people died of
AIDS in 1997, representing a fifth of the total 11.7 million
deaths since the disease was first discovered in the early 1980s.

<HEADLINE> 7 PKK Rebels Killed in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Kurdistan Democratic
Party (KDP) killed seven rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) coming from Iran, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that KDP forces surrounded a group of about 200
PKK militants Saturday, who infiltrated from Iran and are trying
to shelter themselves between Pirbela and Snath camps in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The KDP exchanged heavy fires with the PKK guerrillas near
Snath camp in the region at Sunday noon and shot dead seven PKK
rebels in the clash, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
It added that it is difficult for the PKK rebels to enter into
Turkey due to the strict security measures taken by the Turkish
government troops so that some PKK militants have tried to shelter
themselves in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and the Turkish security forces support each other in
fighting against the PKK and KDP's rival Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) in northern Iraq. Turkey often launches
cross-border attacks on PKK in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
So far, there are about 2,500 or 3,000 PKK rebels still
staying in northern Iraq and they often infiltrate into Turkey to
attack Turkish military and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war for
autonomy in eastern and southeastern Turkey, which has claimed
over 28,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Shilling Tumbles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- After days of steady
decline, the Tanzanian Shilling ended lower last week and does
not appear to have found a floor, according to the Daily News
today.
</P>
<P>
"We are short of Dollars, very short, so we are seeing the
Shilling depreciating," a senior treasury official at a leading
foreign bank said.
</P>
<P>
The Shillings had depreciated to 630 to the Dollar by the end
of last week.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Tanzania (BOT) said the Shilling was
trading at a mid-rate of 617.8194 Friday compared to last
613.8396 on the previous Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some market participants said the Shilling would get a boost
this month if the International Monetary Fund (IMF) grants
Tanzania the extra credit it had requested to offset the effects
of drought.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has asked for additional special drawing rights,
worth about 28 million U.S. Dollars under the IMF's enhanced
structural adjustment facility (Esaf).
</P>
<P>
If that credit is approved when the IMF board meets next
month, it will give "an upward push to the supply of Dollars in
the market, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official on China's Foreign Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China will become an important
player in the future multi-polarized world as the nation's
international status and prestige rise steadily, according to Liu
Huaqiu, director of the State Council Foreign Affair Office.
</P>
<P>
Liu, a senior official in charge of China's foreign affairs,
expressed the viewpoint in an article carried in the 23rd issue of
the fortnightly "Qiushi Magazine" which was published today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that new China was founded in 1949 and that China has
always, especially over the past 20 years, observed the
diplomatic thinking initiated by late Chinese leaders Mao Zedong,
Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping. He said the nation has recorded
monumental achievements in unswervingly implementing its
independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
Liu's article, which contains nearly 10,000 characters,
provides an in-depth analysis of the basic objectives and principles,
and main content of the country's foreign policy, as well as
major readjustments and diplomatic achievements since 1949.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in his report to the 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), General Secretary Jiang Zemin
reiterated that "China will, as always, adhere to an independent
foreign policy of peace".
</P>
<P>
Jiang also provided a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of
China's current 10 principles on foreign affairs, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
"This fully reflects the close attention the CPC has paid to
the independent foreign policy of peace and its unswerving
determination to continue the policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that Deng Xiaoping, who directed China's diplomatic
work over the past two decades, had an excellent mastery of the
domestic developments and of the changing international situation,
as well a full grasp of the characteristics of the times. He noted
that Deng further developed and perfected China's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Liu went on to say that the basic goal of the policy, which
features independence and peace, is to firmly safeguard the
nation's independence, security and sovereignty, and adopt a
positive attitude toward safeguarding world peace, in a bid to
create a long-term peaceful international environment for China's
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said the main content and basic principles of the policy
include: safeguarding independence; opposing hegemonism and
safeguarding world peace; developing good-neighborly relations;
strengthening unity and cooperation amongst third world nations;
establishing and developing friendly cooperative ties with all
nations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence; maintaining a positive attitude toward international
cooperation; making energetic efforts to promote the establishment
of a new international order; opposing arms race and promoting the
disarmament process; practicing comprehensive opening to the
outside world; and actively enhancing the friendly
people-to-people contacts throughout the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
Liu said that in the early days of new China, it formed an
alliance with the former Soviet Union to fight hostility,
isolation and blockade by the United States with a "turning to one
side" strategy that was necessary at the time.
</P>
<P>
But, the former Soviet Union was chauvinistic and attempted to
force China to submit to its own strategic needs. It proposed
setting up a long-wave radio station that it would control in
China and a joint naval fleet, showing its intent to control China
militarily. To get China to submit to its control, the former
Soviet Union put pressure on China by withdrawing its experts from
China and tearing up economic agreements it had signed with China
and deployed one million soldiers along the Sino-Soviet and
Sino-Mongolian borders, posing a serious threat to China.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard its sovereignty and dignity, China did not give in
to the Soviet pressure and put up a fight against hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, with the U.S.'s strength reduced by the Vietnam
War, the former Soviet Union took advantage of the opportunity to
expand, posing a serious threat to world peace and Chinese
security. Having assessed this situation, the late Chairman Mao
Zedong decided to open the door to Sino-US relations, and put
forth the "one-line" strategy that extended from Japan to the
U.S. and to Europe, in order to counter the Soviet challenge.
</P>
<P>
This strategy began in the mid-'70s and lasted until the
early '80s. It played an important role in relaxing tensions in
Chinese security at the time, ending the long period of being
surrounded by enemies and curbing Soviet expansion and hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that there are defects in drawing a line on the basis
of strategic relations, and both the "turning to one side"
strategy and the "one-line" strategy affected Chinese relations
with some countries to certain degree and costed the country in
necessary flexibility and initiative.
</P>
<P>
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, China entered the new phase of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and Deng Xiaoping made some major
adjustments to the country's foreign policy, based on changes in
the domestic and international situations, in order to safeguard
independence and self-determination and to be truly non-aligned.
</P>
<P>
China changed the "one-line" strategy and did not form an
alliance or forge strategic relations with any big powers. On
international issues, it considers the basic interests of the
Chinese people and the people of the world and independently
decides its own stance on the pros and cons of these issues.
</P>
<P>
China made its policy of peace in foreign relations clear when
Deng Xiaoping said that its fundamental goals were to oppose
hegemonism, safeguard world peace, and promote human progress. He
tied the principle of independence closely to that of peaceful
foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
Deng emphasized that socialist China belongs to the third world
and will always stand by the third world. He always took
strengthening unity and co-operation with developing countries as
a basic part of China's foreign affairs, promoting mutually
beneficial and friendly co-operative relations with the countries
of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Deng also was of the view that in handling state-to-state
relations, no lines should be drawn in accordance with social
systems and ideology, and corrected the deviation of "drawing a
line" by the former Soviet Union or "drawing a line" by the US,
creating favorable conditions for friendly co-operative relations
with all other countries.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the proper handling of the relations between
independence and opening up to the outside world. In the process
of opening up, the country should always put national independence
and sovereignty above anything else.
</P>
<P>
Another adjustment of the foreign policy was the resolving of the
Hong Kong and Macao issues with the "one country, two systems"
concept. The success of this concept has created favorable
conditions and practical experience for the resolution of the
Taiwan issue, and provided a successful example for other
countries to follow in resolving issues left from history by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Deng also spelled out the strategic principle of keeping a
level mind in observation, getting a firm foothold, having a sure
hand, and accomplishing something.

Deng's ideas on foreign affairs are an important part of his
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and a
creative development of the foreign policy of peace formulated by
Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, in spite of drastic changes in the
international situation, China has followed Deng's ideas on
diplomacy and scored great achievements in diplomacy:
</P>
<P>
-- It has withstood the effects of the drastic changes in
Eastern Europe and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union,
and the pressure and sanctions imposed on China by some Western
countries;
</P>
<P>
-- It has successfully safeguarded its sovereignty and national
dignity;
</P>
<P>
-- It resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and
pushed forward its great cause of peaceful reunification of the
motherland;
</P>
<P>
-- It has promoted good-neighborly friendships, and developed
friendship and co-operation with its neighboring countries;
</P>
<P>
-- It has strengthened unity and co-operation with most other
developing countries;
</P>
<P>
-- On the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-Existence, it has developed relations with Eastern Europe and
the Commonwealth of Independent States, and improved its relations
with Western countries;
</P>
<P>
-- It has created a good international environment for
continuing its reform, opening-up, and modernization drive by
expanding economic, trade, and technology exchanges and
co-operation, and cultural and other exchanges with other
countries;
</P>
<P>
-- It has taken an active part in international and regional
diplomacy, playing a unique role in diplomatic activities,
promoting the development of multi-polarization, and making a
great contribution to world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the third-generation of CPC Central Committee
leaders with Jiang Zemin at the core is following the independent
foreign policy of peace formulated by the first-generation and the
second-generation of leaders, and this demonstrates their ability
to correctly handle complicated international affairs.
</P>
<P>
No matter what changes may occur in the international situation
in years to come, Liu said, China, under the leadership of the CPC
Central Committee headed by Jiang Zemin, will continue to hold the
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory high, continue to follow the
independent foreign policy of peace, strive for a lasting
international peaceful environment, and make its due contributions
to its modernization drive and to world peace and
development.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Deputy PM Condemns US Support for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass has blamed the Mideast peace
stalemate on the U.S. bias toward Israel and backed Iran's
military buildup to counter a Turkish-Israeli alliance.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Arabic newspaper Al Ahram, which
published today, Tlass said that the conflict between the Arabs
and Israel will continue in the visible future. He accused the
United States of providing political support for Israel and
allowing the peace process to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
He warned against the perils caused by the policies of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that they can catapult
the area into "new de facto realities of more rabid and ferocious
violence."
</P>
<P>
The senior Syrian official lashed out at the United States for
its sustained and constant military support for Israel, saying
that it provides Israel with the most up-to-date arms and weapons.
</P>
<P>
Instead of pressuring Israel to propel the peace process,
Washington is bringing pressures to bear on the Arabs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tlass said that Turkey, backed by a military pact
with Israel, is covetous of Iraqi oil by setting up a security
zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore it is in the interest of the Arabs that Iran's
military power be developed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian defense minister spoke of the recent Iranian war
games in the Gulf, saying that they mirror Tehran's desire to
increase its defense capabilities as it is facing "dangerous
challenges from Israel, the United States and Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Concluding his interview with Al Ahram, Tlass underlined the
need to achieve Arab solidarity to fulfill the higher and supreme
interests of the Arab nation and safeguard and maintain its
security and stability.

<HEADLINE> World Labor Congress to Discuss Globalization Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The World Confederation of
Labor (WCL) began its 24th congress here today to deliberate how
people can benefit from globalization and how the WCL can help
them.
</P>
<P>
The six-day congress, under the theme "from
internationalization to globalization: struggle to change course,"
is expected to discuss the wide-ranging social consequences, both
positive and negative, of the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
The WCL believes that while the globalization process has its
positive side, such as promoting contacts, business and
cooperation, it also has a lot of negative consequences, such as
growing inequalities between people, sectors and countries, and
widening gap between the poor and the rich.
</P>
<P>
What is more, economy is escaping more and more the national
laws, paving the way for "a wild, unbridled and arrogant
liberalism."
</P>
<P>
WCL President Willy Peirens said in a statement that
globalization is dictated too much by financial or economic
groups, which want to make profits, and even want to make profits
without having to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from about 112 countries and regions are
participating in the congress.

<P>
The six-day meeting, which concluded today, made the decision
on the production ceiling after a tough debate among the member
countries. Some members proposed to increase the quota on an
estimation that world oil demand next year will increase by 1.8 to
1.9 million bpd. But some others worried about the drop of oil
price following the increase of production.
</P>
<P>
The new quota will be effective from January 1, 1998, and is
still below the 28 million bpd of production during October 1997,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In October, the price of oil ranged from 18 to 20 U.S. dollars
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
"If oil prices drop, OPEC will hold a special meeting and
discuss its oil production," Soebroto noted.
</P>
<P>
OPEC wants to be the leader in the oil market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Soebroto said that oil producing countries are still trying to
develop the technology for new oil products which would be
friendlier to the environment.
</P>
<P>
Oil and energy ministers from OPEC's 11 member countries --
Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela -- attended
the meeting.

</P>
<P>
Share prices, dropping for the eighth consecutive day, fell
14.70 points to 393.16, the lowest since June 1987.

United Nations Children's Fund are trying to create enough
awareness in various states of the country, particularly at the
grass-root level.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Olympics Organisiers Agree to Raise Downhill Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Nagano Winter Olympics organisers
agreed to raise the starting point of the men's downhill course on
Monday, ending a four-year-long dispute shadowing the Games.
</P>
<P>
The compromising decision was expected to be finalized late in
the day by the major officials of the Nagano Olympic Organising
Committee (NAOC).
</P>
<P>
New downhill course was poised to stretch into the protected
national park.
</P>
<P>
The International Ski Federation (FIS) required to extend the
course to 1,800 meters from the original 1,680 meters, the
shortest in the Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
But the NAOC officials declined the requirement due to Japan's
environmental laws which ban any constructions in protected areas.
</P>
<P>
The new compromise plan, which was drawn by FIS downhill
designer Bernard Russi, claimed a start at 1,765 meters above sea
level, a stretch skirting ouside the reserve -- down a narrow
strip by the edge of the mountain dotted with towers for ski lifts.
</P>
<P>
NAOC's secretariat, dominated by local administrators, recently
agreed to raise the starting point.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Unveils New Growth Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways will make major
changes in its routes and flights network in Europe, the Middle
East and West Africa to raise revenue which grew by 13.2 percent
between March and September, a local report said today.
</P>
<P>
Unaudited results for the first six months of the fiscal year
starting from March showed that the company's revenue rose to 5.7
billion Shillings (89 million U.S. Dollars) from five billion
Shillings (78 million Dollars) in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The national carrier would buy one new B737 aircraft and lease
two more. A fourth would be delivered in March 1999, bringing the
fleet of B737s to six, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The airline would axe its Rome and Paris flights and
discontinue the use of Fokker aircraft over the next three months
while trying to expand regional connections, Chief Executive
Brian Davies was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Rome and Paris routes were no longer viable because of
competition from cheaper chartered flights, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the airline will introduce two flights a week to
Douala, Cameroun and three to Lagos, Nigeria. Also planned are
additional flights to Cairo, Khartoum and Kigali, capitals of
Egypt, Sudan and Burundi respectively.
</P>
<P>
The company will also double flights to Dubai and increase the
number of connecting flights through Nairobi, said Davies.
</P>
<P>
"The target is to provide a maximum two-hour connecting time
between flights with improved passenger transfer and baggage
systems," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The airline today also launched a cooperation pact with Eagle
Aviation to expand a network of domestic services over the next
two years, he added.

FUZHOU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
Province expects to increase the number of deep-water berths to 50
from the present 31 and their total handling capacity to 69
million tons by the year 2000, Governor He Guoqiang told a recent
symposium on Fujian port development.
</P>
<P>
It expects to have 120 to 135 deep-water berths with a total
handling capacity of 180 to 200 million tons by 2010.

<HEADLINE> China Using Japanese Loans to Control River Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province
will use 100 million US dollars in 30-year Japanese loan to deal
with the serious pollution of the province's largest Xiangjiang
River.
</P>
<P>
With a State Council approval, the province will begin water and
air pollution control projects along the river with the loans and
1.23 billion billion yuan (140 million US dollars) from China.
</P>
<P>
The Xiangjiang watershed covers 40 percent of Hunan's area and
about 60 percent of its population. Because large amounts of
industrial and household wastes are discharged into the river
daily and gas emissions cause acid rain, people's lives have
been threatened.
</P>
<P>
Hunan will build 24 pollution control projects along the river
in 1998: seven urban waste water treatment projects, six urban gas
and liquefied gas projects, three urban garbage treatment projects,
and eight industrial pollution control projects.
</P>
<P>
After the first-phase construction, pollution of the river is
expected to be reduced by more than 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Light but Frothy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
surged to its highest close in 14 trading days today as better
Asian markets prompted some bargain hunters to snap up cheapened
blue chip shares.
</P>
<P>
In a late surge, the all ordinaries broke through the 2500
barrier for the first time since November 13, closing 48.3 points,
or 1.96 percent, higher at 2513.4.
</P>
<P>
However, brokers said the improvement was exaggerated by the
thin volume of today's trade as many buyers chose to see further
evidence of a calming of Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
National turnover for the day was just 270.92 million shares at
a value of 521.22 million U.S. dollars, with rises outnumbering
falls 516 to 500.
</P>
<P>
Larger stocks were the main beneficiary of today's trade, with
shares such as BHP, WMC and ICI - all of which had notably
suffered over the past two months - increasing significantly.
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty thin trade but the Asian markets were pretty
firm," Steve Mayne from Nevitts said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the resource stocks have bounced back after a real
selldown in recent times and there may have been some bargain
buying there and some readjustment," Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose 71.5 points to 4301.9.
</P>
<P>
ICI was the best performed of the major resource stocks,
jumping 52.5 cents to 10.54 dollars after a November plunge.
</P>
<P>
Among the major banks, Westpac was the most improved,
increasing 22.2 cents, National Australia Bank rose 35.3 cents,
ANZ lifted by 11 cents while Commonwealth was 6.9 cents better.
</P>
<P>
Resource stocks outstripped industrials today, and the all
resources index closed 30.9 points higher, or 2.92 percent, at
1087.6.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks were broadly better today as the bullion price
improved 8.00 U.S. dollars per ounce on Friday's close to 296.50.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The full-court and full-bench
hearings fixed for today separately have been adjourned at the
request of representatives of various bar associations.
</P>
<P>
The two separate hearings were called by Justice Saeed Uzzman
Siddiqui and Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah respectively.
</P>
<P>
The full-court meeting was scheduled to hear petitions against
the appointment of the chief justice while the full-bench meeting
was to hear petitions against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on the
alleged contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
All 17 judges of the apex court agreed to have informal
meetings to sort out the matters and not to hold the scheduled
hearings today, President of Supreme Court Bar Association Abid
Hasan Minto told the media this morning.
</P>
<P>
According to Minto, the judges agreed to adjourn the two
separate meetings of the benches, and held an informal meeting to
discuss the matters pending with the apex court.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Supreme Court said that the judges had an
informal get-together this morning to discuss the "two cause
lists" which were issued separately on Saturday and sort out other
related matters.
</P>
<P>
A 15-member delegation of the various bar associations this
morning persuaded the judges to sit together and resolve the issue
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Minto said they succeeded in their efforts and all the 17
judges sat together for more than one hour. They were scheduled to
meet again this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said the judges were discussing the issues of their common
concern.
</P>
<P>
By accepting their proposals the bench expressed solidarity
with the bars, hoping that the matter may be amicably resolved,
Minto added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tight security measures were observed outside the
Supreme Court building and no outsider without valid passes were
allowed to enter the court's premises.
</P>
<P>
On the directives of Interior Minister Chaudhry Shujat Hussain,
the local administration adopted strict measures to maintain law
and order on the occasion.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker After Quarterly Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker today, as worse than expected quarterly current account
data added to the list of woes already surrounding the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
The currency finished at 67.88 U.S. cents, down from 68.03
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported today that the
seasonally adjusted current account deficit widened to 4.63
billion Australian dollars (3.14 billion U.S. dollars) in the
September quarter, from 2.98 billion Australian dollars (2.02
billion U.S. dollars) in the June quarter. The outcome was worse
than market expectations of a deficit of 4.10 billion.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the current account was likely to get worse
going into 1998, due to the risk that Australian export volumes
and commodity prices would fall on the back of a slowdown in Asian
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
ANZ head of foreign exchange sales John Reedyk said, "With all
the turmoil in Asia there is going to be less demand for our
commodities and less demand for our exports than there has been
over the past few years."
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia treasury manager Paul Macarounas said the
data today only adds to the worries already surrounding the
currency such as falling commodity prices and an economic slowdown
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar now looked like finding a base of
support around 67.70 U.S. cents, although a break of that level
would bring it down to 66.80," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar closed today at 86.69
Japanese yen, from 86.74 last Friday, and at 1.1980 German marks,
from 1.1981.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Halve Armed Forces By 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua)-- South Africa is to
continue pruning its armed forces from a high of 135,000
personnel to around 70,000 by 1999, local daily, The Star
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Various voluntary retrenchment and rationalization processes
are now in operation, the newspaper quoted unidentified sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The number in the South African National Defense Force swelled
in 1994/95 as a result of the integration of the former South
African Defense Force, the military wing of the ruling African
National Congress, and about 2,000 members of the KwaZulu Natal
para-military force.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures indicate there remain only 90,000 uniformed
and civilian personnel. Thousands more will probably go during
1998 with the remainder in the first four months of 1999, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Contingency plans have been drawn up by the Department of
Defense to close a key naval base and two air-force bases in the
wake of further budget cut.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 1998-99 military budget is to be discussed by
defense and other government officials in Cape Town on December 3
prior to a final allocation being made known when the national
budget is presented.
</P>
<P>
The current financial year allocation for defense totaled
about 10 billion Rand (2.08 billion U.S. Dollars ), and this is
expected to cut by at least 500 million Rand (104 million U.S.
Dollars) after earlier expectations that funding would be
increased marginally.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Chinese Official on Macao Civil Service Localization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official in
Macao said the localization of Macao's civil service must proceed
from reality and be conducted in accordance with the Basic Law,
and that the permanent residents of Portuguese origin should be
treated equally in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
told Ryuichiro Nakamura, chief of the Hong Kong bureau of Japan's
NHK, in an interview last week that the Chinese side sticks to
three principles on the issue of the localization of Macao's civil
service.
</P>
<P>
Certain progress has been made over the past several years due
to the good cooperation between China and Portugal, and the joint
efforts of all sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, more than 70 percent of the lower
ranking service was localized, and this year has seen progress in
the higher ranking positions, he noted, adding that the first
Chinese took the position of department chief last month.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that what has been done so far is not enough.
</P>
<P>
"The progress is not satisfactory, considering the fact that
there are only a little more than two years left before the
handover of power (in 1999)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that to realize the localization of the civil
service as early as possible is required by the Basic Law, and
this is the first principle of the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of Macao clearly states that the civil service
must be localized, and that main posts of the future Special
Administrative Region (SAR) should be held by Chinese citizens
from among Macao's permanent residents.
</P>
<P>
"The localization of middle and senior ranking officials should
be quickened through great efforts," he said. "That is demanded by
law in the interest of a smooth transition and smooth handover,
and everything should be done according to law."
</P>
<P>
The second principle is that the localization should start from
 the reality in Macao. Macao is a multiple society and Chinese
residents account for 97 percent of the population, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In a society like this, the will of the overwhelming Chinese
residents should be reflected in the future SAR administration,"
he said. "The proportion of Chinese citizens from among Macao's
permanent residents should be raised in the senior and middle rank
service so that the civil service of the future SAR will better
serve the broad residents."
</P>
<P>
The third principle, he said, is that the Macao-born Portuguese
permanent residents of Macao among the civil service are welcome
to stay on in the civil service of the future SAR.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese side has made very clear that all
people are equal before the law of the Macao SAR, and no
communities shall be treated unequally because they are
minorities.
</P>
<P>
"It is the wish of the Chinese side to maintain a stable force
of civil servants," he said. "The Macao-born Portuguese civil
servants are welcome to stay on as servants of the Macao SAR if
they wish to do so."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, if relevant government departments of the
Macao SAR deem it necessary, they can employ Portuguese and other
foreign nationals as advisors or to fill professional and
technical posts.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that the three principles are required by the
resumption of exercise of China's sovereignty over Macao on
December 20, 1999. They also conform to the spirit of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and the Macao basic law, and
serve the interests of both China and Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Histadrut Strike Enters 2nd Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua)-- The strike by estimated
150,000 Israeli clerks and municipal workers entered its second
day today in defiance of a National Labor Court ruling Saturday
which permitted only a 24-hour walkout.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut, also known as Israeli National Trade Union, the
organizer of the strike, held a meeting today to discuss widening
the strike by asking civil servants and bank workers to join in
the strike if progress can not be made in the talks with the
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The strike encompassing workers of 360 local authorities
has paralyzed operations of day care centers, nursery schools,
government corporations and national institutions like the Jewish
Agency and Jewish National Fund.
</P>
<P>
Many schools were also disrupted, since maintenance personnel
and secretaries are also on strike.
</P>
<P>
An additional 20,000 clerks joined the strike today, which
affected hospitals, universities and colleges.
</P>
<P>
The strike was launched Sunday in protest against government
demands for cost-cutting measures by local authorities to reduce
an overall deficit of 11.4 billion U.S. dollars. Some cuts will
erase worker's bonuses, the Histadrut said.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut strike organizer Shlomo Shani and Treasury director
of wages Yossi Kucik met Saturday afternoon, but no progress was
made in resolving their differences.
</P>
<P>
The National Labor Court, which upheld the 24-hour strike, is
expected to decide today about whether to issue back-to-work
orders.
</P>
<P>
The worst effects of the strike are felt by parents,
especially single mothers, who could not send their children to
kindergartens since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sanitation workers' strike entered its fifth day
today in Tel Aviv and the city's 106 emergency services were
closed down to support the sanitation workers' strike against the
city authority for contracting private companies for garbage
collections.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 26 sanitation workers Saturday on suspicion
of sabotaging 22 garbage trucks belonging to private contractors.
</P>
<P>
The Tel Aviv sanitation workers still refuse to return to
work, despite court orders instructing them to do so.
</P>
<P>
This is the second largest nation-wide strike in Israel this
year. The previous one was organized by the Histadrut at the end
of September, which paralyzed all sectors of the country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Reports Good Autumn Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai harvested 1.6 million
tons of grain this autumn, a level approaching last year's
record harvest.
</P>
<P>
Reports from local agricultural department indicate that the
city's total grain output this year stood at 2.18 million tons,
including the summer grain output.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai thus fulfilled its goal of producing two million tons
of grain a year.
</P>
<P>
Local agronomists note that the quality of autumn grain
has improved greatly due to the wide use of improved varieties of
rice.
</P>
<P>
However, the good harvest will not lead to a rise in the income
of farmers, because the average autumn grain purchasing price in
the city dropped by 25 percent this year compared to the 1996
level and the cost for agricultural production means rose by three
percent.
</P>
<P>
Supply has now exceeded demand on Shanghai's autumn grain market,

<HEADLINE> India's Upper House Adjourned Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua)-- India's Rajya Sabha (Upper
House of Parliament) was adjourned sine die here today following
the resignation of the United Front (UF) government on the evening
of November 28 after the Congress withdrew its support to the
government the same day.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the House R.C. Tripathi laid on the table
of the House the letter of resignation of Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral and the letter of President K.R. Narayanan requesting
him to continue in office till alternative arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mrs. Jayanti
Natrajan asked the House to be adjourned sine die and Chairman of
the House and Vice President Krishan Kant also agreed.
</P>
<P>
Like the Lower House of Parliament, the Upper House could not
transact any business after it met for winter session on November
19 and it had to be adjourned daily after meeting for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Normal functioning of the House was paralyzed with the Congress
MPs insisting in their demand for the removal of three ministers
of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), one of the UF
constituents, from the Union government following the indictment
of the party in the interim report of the Jain Commission probing
the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case in 1991. The report was tabled
before the two Houses on November 20 by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) was adjourned sine
die last Tuesday for the same reason but it is being reconvened
Tuesday. The decision to reconvene the Lower House was taken on
Friday before the Gujral government resigned.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Says His Sweden Visit Beyond Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said that the main purpose of his visit to Sweden is to strengthen
coordination between the two countries "in solving key world and
European problems."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of his visit, Yeltsin said Russia will
manage to coordinate positions on many issues with Sweden.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks between the two sides will be devoted to
bilateral relations, above all, to economic cooperation. "A solid
package of agreements" will be signed during the visit, Yeltsin
said.
</P>
<P>
These agreements will include rescheduling former USSR debt
owed to Sweden, promoting cooperation in the safe use of nuclear
energy in peaceful purposes, in space exploration, and in culture,
science, and education, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and Sweden have already achieved much in removing the
obstacles to their trade and economic ties," he said. "Work toward
settling the problem of the former USSR commercial debt to Swedish
firms is nearing completion."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that Russian-Swedish trade turnover had doubled
over the last five years. But he emphasized that it is so far
"clearly inadequate" since "the powerful economic potential of our
countries allows them to interact far more actively."
</P>
<P>
The president expressed the hope that Sweden will put more
investment to Russia, saying that Swedish investments in Russia
have so far fallen short of Sweden's real potential.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the rights of the Russian-speaking population in
the Baltic countries, Yeltsin said all kinds of Baltic problems
had long been discussed at Russian-Swedish talks.
</P>
<P>
He added that Russia's latest proposals to offer the Baltic
countries security will also be discussed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
In October Yeltsin offered Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania a
security pact.

<HEADLINE> Exiled Politicians Return to Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 Cambodian
politicians, who have been exiled since last July, today returned
to the country from Thai capital of Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The politicians, who were greeted at the airport by Lakhan
Mehotra, special envoy of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, were all members of the Union of Cambodian Democrats, which
is made up of the PUNCINPEC, Khmer Buddhist Liberal Democratic
Party, Khmer Nation Party and Khmer Neutral Party.
</P>
<P>
Their purpose of coming back was to pave the way for ousted
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and some other exiled politicians to
return to the country safely and participate in the next year's
national election, they said.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen ousted his rival Ranariddh, then
first prime minister, on July 6 after a weekend of fighting
between troops loyal to the two men. Ranariddh has been exiled
since then.
</P>
<P>
The politicians also asked the U.N to have more influence over
the affairs in Cambodia, so that the election scheduled for next
May will be guaranteed and held in a free, just and democratic way.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has more than once appealed to the exiled politicians
to come back, but some of them still worried about their safety in
the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Hun Sen insisted that Ranariddh should face the trial
for his violations of law, such as arms smuggling. If convicted,
he will not be allowed to come in for the election before he is
amnestied by the King, Hun Sen added.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh has turned down the offer of the second prime
minister.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Workforce Holds Larger Portion in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- There are at least 245,000
foreigners in Israel's workforce this year, compared to 125,000 in
1990, today's local daily Jerusalem Post quoted labor and social
affairs officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
This figure means that more than one in every 10 workers is
non-Israeli.
</P>
<P>
And there is a notable increase in the number of foreign
home-care workers, which has doubled in the past three years and
could reach as many as 15,000 by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yigal Ben-Shalom, director-general of Labor and Social Affairs
Ministry, said that the Israeli government is taking the issue
very seriously and is trying to lower the number of the foreign
workforce to the level in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Textile Enterprise Gears up from Red Operation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Anda Cotton Mill
has successfully reduced huge losses by trimming its work force
and cutting the number of spindles in operation, thereby setting
an excellent example for China's loss-making state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Today's edition of People's Daily, China's leading newspaper,
carried a feature article on Anda's notable progress. The State
Economic and Trade Commission listed the mill as one of the 10
state enterprises that have recorded progress in reducing losses
by deepening reform and improving management. The Chinese media
plans to carry a series of reports on factories contributing to
their success.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai No.10 and No.28 cotton mills were merged to form
Anda in June 1996. Anda originally had 88,000 spindles and
employed 2,139 weavers. The merger was facilitated by the fact
that No.28 Mill suffered 1996 losses of 30 million yuan, but had
idle space for the installation of additional machinery. On the
other hand, the No.10 Mill, the only profitable operation amongst
Shanghai's state textile enterprises, was forced to relocate from
an area designated as part of the financial district in the Pudong
New Area.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's textile authorities decided to merge the two mills
in hopes of creating a stronger player in the market.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition in the textile market and requirements to
adjust Shanghai's textile industry dictated that the new venture
trim the number of operational spindles and reduce the number
redundant employees in order to survive amidst tough competition
by cutting costs and increasing efficiency. Anda originally had
over 5,000 employees and some 5,200 retirees.

<TEXT>
<P>
An analysis conducted following the merger revealed that 3,000
workers and 52,000 spindles would be sufficient to operate the new
mill.
</P>
<P>
Anda's management team has extended great effort and achieved
notable success in reducing redundant workers. The reemployment
center operated by the Shanghai Textile Holding Co. has helped
1,256 laid-off workers find new job opportunities, thereby
lessening burdens on the enterprise. In addition, Anda has
allocated funds to encourage workers to seek jobs on their own,
with some 500 workers terminating their contracts in order to
begin new careers.
</P>
<P>
The program to reduce the number of spindles proceeded much
more smoothly than the effort to reduce the work force. Anda
optimized its equipment by scrapping 20,000 spindles and
transferring an additional 16,000 units to other plants. The
effort led to marked improvements in terms of both output and
product varieties. Statistics for the first 10 months of the year
showed that Anda had a total yarn output of 6,034
tons. Projections call for 1997 sales to rise by 42.93 percent to
180 million yuan. The company's annual cotton yarn output will
increase 59.75 percent, with the cloth output expected to soar
229.7 percent. Anda also plans to raise salaries for its workers.
</P>
<P>
"Losses between January and October were cut to 187,000 yuan,"
according to Anda Director Chen Guozhen. "We hope to earn a profit
for the year," said Chen.

<HEADLINE> Currency Trading Needs Regulating: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today stressed the need for regulating currency
trading in the interest of everyone for otherwise the economic
damage inflicted on developing economies could spread to the
developed countries as well.
</P>
<P>
"If currency trading is to be allowed, then it should be made
transparent and it should be regulated," he said when opening the
meetings of ASEAN finance ministers and ASEAN Plus Six as well as
the conference on ASEAN Financial Initiatives for the 21st Century
here today.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) finance
ministers and those from Australia, China, Japan, South Korea and
the United States and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
of China, known as ASEAN Plus Six, began a tow-day meeting here
today to dwell on the current economic situation faced by
countries in the region following recent attacks on their
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "It is ridiculous that at a time when
governments and all other businesses are being exhorted to be open
and transparent, currency trading must be allowed to do their
trading in absolute secrecy."
</P>
<P>
He said, "International trade is being regulated by principles,
policies and regulation agreed to in the World Trade Organization
(WTO). Why should currency trading be exempted from the purview of
the WTO? Why cannot the WTO discuss and formulate rules and
regulation for international currency trading, rules which the
rich and the poor alike have a hand in drawing up, rules which are
fair and just and designed to create wealth and prosperity for
all?"
</P>
<P>
He said currency trading demands to be regulated as every
country would be affected adversely by the uncontrolled currency
trading activities which have left a trail of shattered and
disoriented economies and nations wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
Given these dangers, Mahathir called on the WTO to formulate
and enforce regulations to reduce the anarchy in currency trading
while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should continue its
supervisory role.
</P>
<P>
He said he saw no reason why currency trading should not be
regulated with fair rules designed to create wealth and prosperity
especially when the worst from currency attacks was not over yet.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said, "There is no conspiracy to dominate the economy
of the developing countries of East Asia, but obviously their
troubles have afforded an opportunity for forcing open their
economies and possible domination by strong and powerful
countries."
</P>
<P>
"We believe in globalization and liberalization of trade, in
dismantling national laws and rules which hamper trade and
cross-border flows of capital. But surely, liberalization and
deregulation of national entities should not result in exposure to
an anarchic world. We have been told to abide by the rule of law,
but how come the abolition of national laws should lead to absence
of the rule of law in the enlarged world market," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meetings, the ASEAN finance ministers and
those from the above-mentioned Six would exchange views on the
causes and extent of the currencies' problem and the policy
responses needed to restore stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Myanmar and
host Malaysia are represented at the meetings by their respective
finance ministers with other ASEAN members Brunei, Vietnam and
Laos by their deputy or vice finance ministers.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN ministers are scheduled to meet representatives from
Japan and the U.S. separately while the ASEAN Ministers Plus Six
would meet IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and World Bank
Senior Vice President Joseph E. Stiglitz during the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus was invited to the meeting to brief the ASEAN
ministers on the IMF task force's progress in studying the role of
currency traders and the possibility of introducing prudential
regulations on currency trading.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the ASEAN finance ministers held a special
meeting here during which they agreed to form a regional
surveillance mechanism within ASEAN as a preventive effort to
avoid the emergence of risk that would precipitate a crisis.

NANJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Administration Bureau in Taixing, in eastern China's Jiangsu
Province, has revoked the business licenses of 107 Sino-overseas
joint ventures in order to improve city's overall use of foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
The companies were closed because of no business operations, a
failure to transfer foreign funding, and high losses.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations were also cancelled for a number of joint
investment projects with little market potential.
</P>
<P>
Taixing's foreign-funded enterprises have exported products
valued at over two billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Filipino-Chinese to Close Business in Protest of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Filipino-Chinese will shut down
their businesses and schools for a day Tuesday in Manila's
Chinatown to protest the killing of a young Filipino-Chinese
businessman by suspected kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown will coincide with the burial of Gordon Morales
Tan, 24, who was slain during a botched kidnapping attempt on
November 27, local television Sky Cable said today in its midday
report.
</P>
<P>
The Citizens Action Against Crime, a non-governmental
anti-crime group, was quoted as saying more than one hundred
groups will join the funeral march for Tan in what they called a
"day of mourning" for all the slain kidnap victims.
</P>
<P>
Tan was the latest to die at the hands of kidnappers. Tan was
walking to his car with a security guard in front of his
family-owned shoe factory in Bulucan province north of Manila last
week when four armed men wearing masks tried to force him into
their car.
</P>
<P>
Tan was shot and killed when he resisted. The security guard
was shot and wounded.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for the Filipino-Chinese community to
resort to a shutdown to protest against the government's
incompetence to smash the rampant kidnapping syndicates. In
January 1993, Chinese schools and business establishments were
also closed for the funeral of a kidnap-for-ransom victim.
</P>
<P>
During the past several months, an upsurge in ransom
kidnappings, mostly of wealthy Filipino-Chinese, was recorded
across the country, prompting President Fidel Ramos to renew a
crackdown on kidnappers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The Citizens Action Against Crime reported last month that
between January and October, there were 116 ransom kidnappings
involving 187 victims nationwide, many of them in the capital and
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
A total of 248 million pesos (8.3 million U.S. dollars) in
ransom has been paid to kidnappers during the period, the group
said. It also warned of more kidnappings of rich businessmen with
Christmas drawing near.

<HEADLINE> Credit Cards Gaining in Popularity in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Even the elderly in China are
in tune with the electronic money age, and are using credit cards
for their pensions, and credit cards are being used by many
institutions in Beijing and Shanghai, as they enter the lives of
more Chinese with amazing speed.
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, after 1985, when the first credit card appeared
in China, credit cards were a status symbol and a means of showing
one's wealth, because they were not so common.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China, one of the nation's largest state commercial
banks, has seen use of its "Great Wall" card multiply over the
past several years. During the January-June period this year, the
number of "Great Wall" card users increased 80 percent from the
1996 figure to 50.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The number of places that use credit cards has also grown, and
they now extend beyond the restaurants, hotels, travel agencies,
and shops of the past, to other sectors, and are even being used
to pay various public utility fees.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's "Peony Card", had
done 254 billion yuan in business by June, accounting for more
than 30 percent of the total amount of credit card business.
</P>
<P>
People in the higher payscales, like businesspeople, are no
longer the exclusive owners of credit cards, and workers,
low-ranking officials, university students, and even rural people
are all potential customers nowadays.
</P>
<P>
A deputy general manager of the Agricultural Bank of China's
Shanghai Branch says that as many as half of his bank's card
holders live in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
But, even though credit cards are gaining in popularity with
Chinese at unprecedented rates of growth, more needs to be done to
increase their use in China, and some people need three cards from
three different banks just to deal with the inconveniences of a
single card that has a limited number of places where it can be
used.
</P>
<P>
Things are changing. China has ATMs in ten provinces and
municipalities, and the Bank of China set up an information center
on October 30 in Beijing, to form a nationwide network to provide
unified service for different credit cards issued by different
banks.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to have 200 million cards in use by the year
2003, and they may be used in 400 Chinese cities by then.

SINGAPORE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Most of the share prices
declined on the Singapore market while the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) surged by 33.6 points to close at 1694.19
points today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices were mixed during the day's
lackluster trading. But the STII increased in the closing minutes
of trade on buying of index-linked stocks.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in other parts of Asia has led foreign
institutional players to allocate their funds into Singapore, they
noted. One of them said that the money was coming in for
Singapore's safe haven status.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume was low at 131.11 million units, valued at
241.93 million Singapore dollars (about 151.21 million U.S.
dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 249 to 89, while 280
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Innovest Bhd was the most actively traded counter as it
registered a turnover of 7.35 million units. It was followed by
Singapore Telecom which had 6.46 million shares traded. Rekapac
was next with 5.65 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local car distributor Cycle &AMP; Carriage (C&AMP;C) and the Overseas
Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) Foreign shared the top spot on
the gainers' list as each of them rose by 40 cents to finish at
7.15 and 9.95 Singapore dollars respectively. Asean Fund and the
United Overseas Bank (UOB) Foreign increased by 35 cents each to
end at nine U.S. dollars and 9.85 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser as it
declined by 1.1 dollars to close at 43.2 Singapore dollars. IPCO
fell by 80 cents to close at 2.6 U.S. dollars, while Hind Hotels
lost 42 cents to finish at 1.78 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Nurses Strike Goes on Despite Govt's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite the government's order
asking all nurses to immediately resume work or face the sack,
the nurse strike for 500-percent pay hike continued into the
fourth day today, paralyzing most public hospitals around Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The strike, reportedly backed by newly-registered opposition
party Safina and the Kenya Medical Association, simmered the
political atmosphere as it took place on the eve of the December
29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
In a one-page press release issued Sunday, the Kenyan Ministry
of Health canceled all leaves and ordered all nurses to report to
their stations and places of work immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Absence from duty without permission will be regarded as a
gross breach of discipline which may render an officer liable to
summary dismissal with loss of all benefits," the ministry
warned.
</P>
<P>
However, the nurses said they will go on with the strike,
starting from Friday, until their demands for minimum pay of
30,000 Shillings (484 U.S. Dollars) and better allowance are met.
</P>
<P>
"Nurses all over the country have vowed to continue the strike
despite threats issued by the government," said two Nairobi
branch co-ordinators of the strike Joshua Maranga and J.K.
Muiruri later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On the day, hundreds of striking nurses held a protest rally
in downtown Nairobi. The rally was soon dispersed by anti-riot
policemen using several tear gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
Several nurses claimed to have sustained "soft tissue
injuries" during the rally.
</P>
<P>
At Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, the strike went on
paralyzing all medical services over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, health service in Kisumu District and the Nyanza
Provincial Hospital were not rendered as the health centers
remained deserted, with a few patients being catered for by their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The nurses could be seen walking in Kisumu, Kenya's
third-largest city bordering on Lake Victoria, but patients at
the hospital said no nurse had reported to the hospital since
Friday, according to local reports available here.
</P>
<P>
Striking nurses at the Nakuru Provincial Hospital, in central
Kenya, chased away students from the Medical Training College who
were assisting patients Sunday.

<HEADLINE> High Grade Bauxite Mineral Found in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has discovered
high grade bauxite deposits in the eastern Tanga region, Daily
News said today.
</P>
<P>
The deposits, at Magamba area, about six kilometers from
Lushoto town, are estimated to have 50 to 60 million tons of
bauxite -- an ore from which aluminum is made.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by a team of geologists led by Medard
Mutakyahwa, a senior lecturer at the University of Dar es Salaam
after an intensive research from the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
According to Mutakyahwa, chemical and mineralogical analysis
made on samples have revealed that bauxite ore found there is 50
to 60 percent aluminum oxide.
</P>
<P>
He said the ore from the deposits had previously been used by
the villagers as ballast material for road construction, but it
was only recently that they discovered the economic importance of
the deposits.
</P>
<P>
These are the first such deposits found in the country, he
said. bauxite is used in the production of aluminum metal,
aluminum sulphate and high grade cement.
</P>
<P>
The research has been helped by a German academic support
agency Daad and the Norwegian Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
He said several private mining companies have shown interest
in the deposits covering an area of 10 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Tanzania's mineral sector is
currently contributing 1.4 percent of the GDP up from a mere 0.5
percent in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The sector is likely to attract investment of up to 400
million U.S. Dollars by the year 2000. Between 300 and 700
prospecting licenses have been issued to potential investors in
the last few years.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Cases Surge in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of people who have
been suffering from AIDS is likely to strike between 23,000 to
30,000 in Vietnam over the next three years, with about
19,000-25,000 dying from the disease, Vietnam press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new estimate comes from a projected figure of between
140,000 to 180,000 carriers of HIV, the virus which leads to
full-blown AIDS, over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The revelation was made during the first national conference on
HIV/AIDS last month which drew 120 doctors and researchers.
</P>
<P>
The statistics were the results of a survey by a group of
researchers at the Hanoi Epidemiology and Hygiene Institute.
</P>
<P>
The institute reported that HIV has now been found in 57 out of
Vietnam's 61 provinces and cities, and that the incidence of
HIV/AIDS differed from province to province.
</P>
<P>
It said the worst-hit group in An Giang province on the
Cambodian border were prostitutes, whereas most HIV sufferers in
the provinces of Quang Ninh and Lang Son on the Chinese border
were drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
Several researchers reported their findings after interviews
with prostitutes, street children, juvenile delinquents and drug
addicts.
</P>
<P>
To coincide with the International AIDS Day, the Vietnamese
national daily Nhan Dan today carries an editorial, calling for
immediate actions to protect children in a world with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"We must actively prevent drug abuse and prostitution from
children, raise the awareness against AIDS among the young people,
especially street children," the leading official newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> China's Pharmaceutical Industry Faces Major Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China's pharmaceutical industry
must rely on high-tech products, a fair competition system and
favorable government policies to meet increasing challenges by the
influx of foreign medicines, according to a major Beijing-based
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Today's Guangming Daily reported that experts at a recent
national conference in Beijing discussed measures to help the
pharmaceutical industry extricate from such a difficult position
that foreign medicines have captured the lion's share of markets
in major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of imported medinces and those manufactured
by foreign-funded enterprises in China has grown at a phenomenal
rate in recent years. They have now held 59 percent share of the
pharmaceutical market in Beijing, 56 percent in Shanghai and 72
percent in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese experts note that in line with State regulations,
pharmaceutical imports should be limited to products which cannot
be produced in China, which offer better clinical effect than
domestic ones, or which are in shart supplies at home.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, a large quantity of foreign medicines which fail
to conform with the regulations have been imported and sold at
high prices in China, according to Li Bangliang, president of the
Hangzhou East China Pharmaceutical Group.
</P>
<P>
The profit-oriented management systems of most hospitals and
misconceptions on the part of patients have resulted in the
irrational competition in the pharmaceutical industry, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals prefer to purchase foreign medicines which can be sold
at higher prices and yield greater profits, while domestically
manufactured medicines of the same quality can only be sold at
lower prices. Li added that many patients take it for granted that
"higher priced medicines offer better effect", and thus tend to
use expensive foreign products.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Earn More from Higher Oil Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will earn additional
revenue of about three million U.S. Dollars per day from oil
sales beginning January 1, 1998 as OPEC has raised its production
quota by 177,000 barrels daily.
</P>
<P>
The relief came Saturday night when the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also re-elected Nigeria's
Rilwanu Lukman to a second three-year term as secretary-general,
the Daily Champion reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the raise of Nigeria's production quota, the first in
over four years, the country's share had been 1.865 million
barrels per day, but from January 1 next year, the allocation
would become 2.042 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the OPEC ministerial council meeting
in Jakarta, Indonesia at the weekend. The council agreed to raise
the total OPEC production to 27.5 million barrels per day from
the current 25.033 million with effect from January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The new quota, effective for six months in the first instance,
would be reconsidered at the next OPEC ministerial council
meeting on June 24 next year in Vienna, Austria.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said today that his government will consider the use of
public funds to keep the country's credit order intact, Kyodo News
service reported.
</P>
<P>
"We will take all available measures to stabilize the financial
system, which is the cornerstone of the economy," Hashimoto said
during a session of the House of Representatives (lower house)
Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,
Hashimoto reiterated the government's firm commitment to
protecting all assets of depositors and investors as well as
wiping away concerns over financial unrest.
</P>
<P>
Miyazawa heads a special task force on financial system
stabilization of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which
is due to unveil a set of measures to maintain the health of
Japan's financial system around December 10.
</P>
<P>
Confidence in Japan's financial system has been severely
weakened following a series of collapses last month of four
financial institutions, including Yamaichi Securities Co. and
Hokkaido Takushoku Bank.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also expressed readiness to freeze the land value tax
so as to promote transactions in the lackluster property market.

To reinvigorate the sagging stock market, Hashimoto hinted once
again at a review of the securities transaction tax.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Xiamen in southeast China's
Fujian Province recorded a foreign trade volume of over 6.5
billion US dollars for the first ten months of this year, up some
15 percent on the previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
The figure included exports of over 3.4 billion US dollars, up
21 percent on the 1996 period, and imports of 3.1 billion US
dollars, up eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Local state-owned enterprises contributed 2.9 billion US
dollars, or 44 percent, of the foreign trade volume, up sightly on
the 1996 figure of 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city's foreign-funded enterprises recorded an 18 percent
rise in exports to 1.69 billion US dollars, with imports rising
slightly by 0.5 percent to 1.67 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dramatic import tariff reductions in October sparked a 42
percent surge in imports for the processing sector when compared
to the same month in 1996. The sector's foreign trade volume of
3.1 billion US dollars accounted for nearly half of the total for
the city.
</P>

Machinery, electronic and textile products accounted for the
bulk of exports, with imports consisting mostly of machinery,
electronic components, and plastic and textile raw materials and
products.
</P>

Xiamen's major overseas trade partners are Hong Kong and
Taiwan, with most exports going to the former and the bulk of
imports coming from the latter.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iran has announced that it
recognizes the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani as
the legal government of Afghanistan and there has been no change
in this policy.
</P>
<P>
Iran's special representative on Afghanistan Alaeddin
Boroujerdi voiced Tehran's stance Sunday evening on the eve of a
congress of Afghan outstanding personalities to be held today in
Iran's central city of Isfahan, the Iranian official news agency
IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
This policy is in line with the international stand adopted
by the United Nations, said Boroujerdi, the former deputy
foreign minister on Asia-Pacific affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the policy followed by Iran throughout the
crisis in Afghanistan was the right approach chosen by the
U.N. and even the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the congress of Afghan leading personalities in Isfahan,
Boroujerdi said this congress demonstrated Iran's policy which
supports any steps taken toward an overall understanding and
peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said many leading Afghan personalities representing various
tribes would participate in the three-day congress and hold
talks on ways to end the crisis in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported that Rabbani arrived in Isfahan Sunday night to
take part in the congress.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said that Iran has welcomed the U.N. proposal to
hold a conference of the countries neighboring Afghanistan to
review ways to implement peace in that country and was prepared
to host such talks.
</P>
<P>
About Afghanistan's seat remaining vacant at the Summit of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to be held here
on December 9-11, Boroujerdi said Rabbani would be welcomed as an
official guest in Tehran, but the occupation of Afghanistan's
seat at the summit was determined by the OIC and has been left
vacant in accordance with a decision made at the Jakarta
conference.

<HEADLINE> South Korea, IMF Continue Negotiations on Terms of Bailout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are continuing their
negotiations on the terms of IMF's bailout for Seoul, particularly
on South Korea's macro-economic growth range.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Ministry of Finance and Economy said Monday
morning that the two sides at Sunday midnight reached an agreement
in principle on terms of the rescue package and the agreement is
waiting for approvals by the South Korean cabinet and the IMF
special board meeting today.
</P>
<P>
However, South Korean Deputy Prime Minister Lim Chang-yuel and
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus continued their
negotiations on differences at some points concerning the terms of
the loan.
</P>
<P>
In their telephone negotiations Monday morning, Michel
Camdessus, who is attending a meeting of Asian finance ministers
in Kuala Lumpur, insisted on demanding that Seoul reduce its gross
domestic product rate to 2.5 percent, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
But Minister Lim upheld the figure at three percent, citing the
possible social unstability due to the high jobless rate, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides also showed differences on issues of
liquidating troubled financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
While the IMF side strongly demanded that 12 insolvent merchant
banks be liquidated, the South Korean side wants softer measures
on the issue, asking to leave the issue for further negotiation
after the loan arrives in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government wishes to complete the agreement on
the terms during today and then hand it to the IMF for approval,
paving the way for the earlier arrival of the first tranche of
about 10 billion U.S. dollars this week.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the third recipient in Asia of IMF funds after
Thailand and Indonesia since August following a wave of steep
currency depreciations caused by massive debt overhangs in the
region.

LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is expected to record a

</P>
<P>
The estimated growth rate would be higher than last year's 3.4
percent, Central Bank Governor Paul Ogwuma said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, the level of growth is "considered too low to support
sustained economic growth", the apex bank boss added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, major factors constraining economic
performance include under-capacity operation of the manufacturing
sector, liquidity overhang, huge external debt stock, and low

<HEADLINE> Water Rationing Starts in Philippine Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Water rationing started today in
the eastern section of the Philippine capital area as the dry
spell generated by the El Nino phenomenon continues to take its
toll in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Water rationing in Metro Manila was ordered late last month by
President Fidel Ramos as the water level at the Angat reservoir
had dropped to 182 meters, 21 meters below the normal level of at
least 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir, located in Bulacan province north of Manila,
provides 97 percent of water supply to the capital city. The
critical level is placed at 170 meters.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Manila Water Service Inc. were quoted today by
local television reports as saying the 12-hour rotation of water
services is just one of two kinds of rationing options of the
company to counter the effects of the weather disturbance.
</P>
<P>
Some areas of eastern Metro Manila will have water from 4 a.m.
to 4 p.m., while water will be available in other areas between 4
p.m. and 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The other option is to use firetrucks in supplying water to
areas hardest hit by the water reduction scheme, such as hospitals
and clinics.
</P>
<P>
Also, starting today the Metro Manila police will conduct foot
and mobile patrol to monitor the illegal and excessive use of
water.
</P>
<P>
But the water rationing plan has not yet started in the west
zone of Metro Manila, where water is supplied by Maynilad Water
Services, the other concessionaire water distribution company.
</P>
<P>
The capital area's water supply and sewerage system were
privatized in May this year. Maynilad Water Services and Manila
Water Service Inc. are the two concessionaires running the system.
</P>
<P>
The water rationing was recommended by the El Nino Task Force
as a contingency measure against the drought brought about by the
El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System earlier approved a
plan by the two private firms to cut daily water distribution by
nearly one third starting next January so as to stretch Metro
Manila's water supply until the onset of the next rainy season.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, which began to affect the Philippines and its
neighboring nations in the middle of this year, is expected to
last until the mid-1998 and bring severe dry spells to the
country.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, a weather phenomenon developing in the southern
Pacific, is associated with many kinds of abnormal weather
activities around the globe, such as severe drought, heavy
flooding and violent storm.

HARARE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has won a "special"
lucrative contract order for about two billion Zimbabwean Dollars
(140 million U.S. Dollars) to export dry food rations, and other
military supplies to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The Herald daily quoted secretary and marketing manager of the
Zimbabwean Defense Industries Company Douglas Mrewa said in an
interview at the weekend that the DRC was now treated as a
special order and therefore was handled separately from others
because their orders were enormous.
</P>
<P>
The company was awarded the contract to supply the military
supplies, and specifically food, for as long as possible because
the DRC was on its path to recovery and was anxious to feed its
estimated 45 million people, Mrewa said.
</P>
<P>
The military supplies include army uniforms and boots and
other foodstuffs.

SHIJIAZHUANG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Two Chinese companies
recently purchased insurance policies valued at 1.7 million yuan
to reward Guo Zhenqing's efforts in uncovering fake merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Guo, 32, has used much of his spare time in helping unlucky
consumers get compensation after having been cheated by dishonest
merchants - free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Each year, Guo has helped resolve about 100 economic disputes
and provided free advice to some 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
But, when he sees fake commodities being sold in certain
stores, he prefers to warn the manager first to get him stop the
illegal business rather than buying the goods and then asking for
compensation.
</P>
<P>
"Enterprises have the same interest as consumers in getting rid
of fake goods in the marketplace," said one of the two companies,
the Little Swan Group, a major washing-machine manufacturer in
China. The Little Swan Group bought an insurance policy valued at
1.5 million yuan for Guo.
</P>
<P>
The Ping'an Insurance Company's Shijiazhuang branch purchased
an insurance policy worth of 200,000 yuan for Guo, saying it
believes consumers who devote themselves to keeping order in the
marketplace should get more supports.
</P>
<P>
Guo now has been invited by the two enterprises to serve as a
quality-control and service supervisor.

<HEADLINE> Two Kenyan Opposition Parties to Join Hands in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Democratic Party of Kenya (DP)
and FORD-Kenya, two leading opposition parties in the country,
have struck a deal of supporting single candidates in each civic
and parliamentary seat in a bid to win this month's elections.
</P>
<P>
DP leader Mwai Kibaki and FORD-Kenya national co-ordinator
Jackson Kibor said in Kitale, western Kenya Sunday the two
parties can only effectively challenge ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) if they approach the poll jointly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kibaki, also DP's presidential candidate, ruled out
involving KANU in a unity government should his party win the
December 29 elections.
</P>
<P>
Kibor said he supported the unity of opposition parties but
hit out at FORD-Asili presidential aspirant Martin Shikuku for
allegedly being a stumbling block to the unity.
</P>
<P>
In general, opposition parties' division is deepening as the
poll approaches despite the new joint deal between DP and
FORD-Kenya.
</P>
<P>
National Development Party (NDP) presidential aspirant Raila
Odinga, in a speech at a rally in Meru Saturday, dismissed his
opposition presidential rivals as dormant and opportunists, and
urged the voters to reject them.
</P>
<P>
He said fellow opposition presidential candidates, including
Kibaki, Shikuku, Charity Ngilu and Wamalwa Kijana (FORD-Kenya),
have manifested an image that they are sure to personally benefit
without minding the welfare of people.
</P>
<P>
Kenya National congress (KNC) Chairman Chibule wa Tsuma
claimed in Mombasa Sunday his party has rejected Ngilu's bid to
vie for the presidency on its tickets because she did not want to
follow procedures.
</P>
<P>
In another development, confusion, complaints and celebrations
marked the KANU nomination following the party headquarters'
order of repeats in 21 constituencies today, leaving political
careers of three Kenyan cabinet ministers to hang in the balance.

<P>
TOKYO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Nagano Winter Olympics organising
committee (NAOC) will reach a compromise plan on Monday to raise
the starting point of the men's downhil course after four years of
bickering poised to shadow the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We will basically accept it," Nagano governor Goro Yoshimura,
also one of NAOC's vice chairmen, said before reporters , "I think
NAOC will also accept it."
</P>
<P>
Russi, the new course designer for the International Ski
Federation (FIS), plans to start the course at 1,765 meters above
sea level, skim the snaking boundary of the park at one point and
jump over at another point.
</P>
<P>
The FIS has demanded the start point of the top ski event be
raised from 1,680 meters above sea level to 1,800 meters on Mount
Karamatsu to prevent the Nagano course being the shortest in
Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
But the secretariat of the NAOC opposed the higher start for
encroaching onto the protected national park where Japan's
evironment laws will ban any construction.
</P>
<P>
NAOC's Secretariat meanwhile insisted that an additional
stretch should skirt outside the reserve -- down a narrow strip
by the edge of the mountain dotted with towers for ski
lifts.

<P>
HEFEI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to an improved investment
climate, overseas-funded businesses in the capital of east China's
Anhui Province are doing well.
</P>
<P>
The city of Hefei had 1,151 overseas-funded enterprises by
September this year, with 4.2 billion US dollars in total
investment, which have contributed a great deal to the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, overseas-funded enterprises had
4.2 billion yuan in output, nearly 3.6 billion yuan in sales, 280
million yuan in pre-tax profits, and nearly 22 million US dollars
in foreign exchange from exports. All these figures were up by a
large margin from the same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of big-name companies like the U.S.'s Coca
Cola, Japan's Hitachi and Sanyo, and Switzerland's ABB, have
invested in Hefei.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises have also purchased or merged with
some local state-owned companies that were on the edge of
bankruptcy. In past two years, a number of local money-losing
state enterprises, with 1.2 billion yuan of assets, have gotten a
new lease on life by these means, and a large number of laid-off
workers have found new jobs.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers Agree on Surveillance Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 1 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN finance ministers
have agreed to form a regional surveillance mechanism within ASEAN
as a preventive effort to avoid the emergence of risk that would
precipitate a crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in their joint statement at the end of the
special meeting here today that the criteria for surveillance
would be developed by the ASEAN Central Bank Forum formed on
November 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
To set the criteria for surveillance, the forum with the
objective of evaluating potential economic and financial risks of
member countries, highlighting policy options and implications and
encouraging early action to minimize such risks, would consult the
relevant international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Select Committee comprising members of the ASEAN
Central Bank Forum and financial officials would form the core of
the mutual surveillance process.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that the ASEAN finance ministers process
would be supported by its own permanent secretariat in order to
facilitate this initiative.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also welcomed the proposal by the Philippines to
seek the assistance of the Asian Development Bank to develop an
initial framework for the establishment of the secretariat and its
terms of reference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference, the meeting's chairman
and Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said ASEAN would
approach the ADB in the hope that the latter would take up the
matter.
</P>
<P>
Apart from getting the surveillance criteria, the secretariat
would have the task of developing the basic data among member
countries which would be used as a framework for reference and
discussion, he said.

HOHHOT, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A couple who were among the
thousands of people laid off their jobs in the city of Baotou in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region four years ago,
managed to earn 20,000 yuan, or 2,400 US dollars, last year.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huanmei and her husband, Zhang Qing, found themselves
unemployed for the first time when the food company they were
working for was approaching bankruptcy. They had to manage to
adapt to days of unemployment, she says, but would think of the
machines in the factory.
</P>
<P>
And, to make matters worse, their savings were not enough to
feed them for a long time. they had to find a way with their own
initiative, so Liu and her husband found a profitable business in
chickens.
</P>
<P>
They sold their house and other property and borrowed 20,000
yuan, 100 times the couple's total monthly income, to begin their
new endeavor.
</P>
<P>
At their makeshift farm, they started raising chickens, but
their lack of experience and technology cost them 15,000 yuan in
two consecutive failures.
</P>
<P>
They encouraged each other and tried to get a lesson from each
failure and ultimately succeeded, and the farm now has 5,000
chickens.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, they were able to help support their
former fellow workers with a chicken-breeding business near a coal
mine.
</P>
<P>
In China, there are at least nine million of these unemployed
workers who are trying to find new work by using different means
like the one Liu and her husband used.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Rated World's Freest Economy Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is rated the freest
 economy in the world four months after it became a Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China, according to the 1998 Index
of Economic Freedom, released here today by the Washington-based
Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has topped the list of the freest economy for the
fourth year in a row, said an editor of the Index, a 408-page
survey that rates economic freedom in 156 of the world's 190
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Kim Holmes, co-editor of the Index report, told a press
briefing here today that Hong Kong's transition from British rule
to a Chinese SAR has done nothing to alter Hong Kong's status as
the world's most open setting to purse economic activities.
</P>
<P>
"(According to) hat we have seen developing over the last few
months, there doesn't seem to be any indication that there is
fundamental change in Hong Kong's economy," said Holmes, who is
vice president of the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The annual index survey said that there continues to be little
government interference in the market place in Hong Kong, where
taxes remain low and predictable, foreign trade still is free and
regulation still is transparent.
</P>
<P>
Even the recent currency turmoil has not affected Hong Kong's
economic fundamentals much, said Holmes.
</P>
<P>
Singapore ranks second in the 1998 Index of Economic Freedom,
said the annual survey, which measures ten economic factors
ranging from trade policy, taxation to monetary policy, banking
and regulation.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Welcomes Heritage Foundation's Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region today welcomed the
1998 Index of Economics Freedom released by the Heritage
Foundation, which shows that Hong Kong continues to be the freest
economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
The results were presented to Tung this morning by a high-level
delegation from the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street
Journal, headed by Kim Holmes, vice president of the Heritage
Foundation, and Gordon Crovitz, vice president of Dow Jones &AMP;
Company.
</P>
<P>
The Index, according to the Heritage Foundation, is used as a
guide by investors seeking profitable destinations for their
capital.
</P>
<P>
On commenting on the Index, Tung stressed that Hong Kong would
continue to make every effort to maintain freedom in trade and
enhance further the competitive edge of its economy.
</P>
<P>
While noting that Hong Kong had maintained the position as the
freest economy in the world for the fourth consecutive year, Tung
said that the study by the Heritage Foundation and Wall Street
Journal also recognized that Hong Kong's economic structure had
remained unchanged after the handover.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy is vibrant as ever and we are as committed to free
trade as before," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive shared the Heritage Foundation's view that
many Asian countries had enjoyed economic success because they
possessed not only economic freedom, but also its necessary
counterpart - economic responsibility.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) reached an agreement early today on the terms
of an IMF rescue package, a spokesman of the Ministry of Finance
and Economy said.
</P>
<P>
"The government will announce the agreement after its approval
at an extraordinary cabinet meeting scheduled for today," the
spokesman told Xinhua, adding that the IMF will soon hold a
special board meeting to approve the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The details of the agreement was not available at this time.
</P>
<P>
Yonhap News Agency said the IMF fund is expected to amount to
50 to 60 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the third recipient in Asia of IMF funds after
Thailand and Indonesia since August following a wave of steep
currency depreciations caused by massive debt overhangs in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have said
they will contribute to the South Korea's efforts to tide over the
crisis and Japan has also indicated it will give some support.
</P>
<P>
Hit hard by a great number of corporate bankruptcies and
defaults, several South Korean commercial and merchant banks are
on the brink of collapse. Markets in the country have been in
turmoil and stock prices have plunged.

<P>
The 72 candidates each obtained nomination by at least 10
members of the 424-strong Election Conference from November 13 to
28.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Method, as the number of nominees

determine the 54 official candidates on the merit of votes. The
final election is scheduled for December 8.
</P>
<P>
The Presidium of the Election Conference held a meeting here
this morning to review the nomination process which was "open,
fair and just."
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Shoppers Spend 20m HKD in Yaohan Clearance Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A total sum of 20 million HK
dollars (2.56 million U.S. dollars) was spent in the two-day
clearance sale of Yaohan's nine local stores for heavily
discounted goods, it was estimated.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 shoppers turned up on Sunday at the Yaohan stores
for the last day of the chain's closure sale, bringing to 130,000
the total number of shoppers in the cash-only weekend frenzy,
according to provisional liquidators Earnst and Young.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that an average of one to two million HK
dollars (120,000 to 250,000 U.S. dollars) was spent in each of the
stores, for products discounted by up to 60 percent, local
newspapers said. Some of the goods were sold for just 20 percent
of their full price.
</P>
<P>
But most of the stores closed earlier than the scheduled time,
with Tsuen Wan, the first Yaohan store to sell out yesterday,
closing its doors at 1:30 PM.
</P>
<P>
Earnst and Young partner Matthew O'Driscoll put the figures of
local shoppers at about 100,000 customers on Saturday and around
30 percent of that amount on Sunday. Although large queues formed
outside the stores early Saturday, but much less bargain-hunters
turned out on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Policemen were assigned to the stores to keep order and offer
help.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Yaohan Department Store Limited announced its closure
two weeks ago as it was unable to pay rent or suppliers, after
losing up to 100 million HK dollars (12.82 million U.S. dollars) a
year for the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Project Secures Energy Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China's decision to build
cross-century strategic energy bases is the key to safeguarding
China's energy security in the 21st century, and to date the
pursuit of this policy has born fruit, Today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The "Shenhua Project" has been designed by China to strengthen
its cross-century energy base, and frequently compared to China's
"Three Gorges Project."
</P>
<P>
To date, two phases of the Shenhua Project have essentially
been completed. The annual coal production capacity of the
Shenfu-Dongsheng coal fields located in the northeast of Shaanxi
Province and the south of the Inner Mongolia Automonous Region has
reached 30 million tons, and the construction of the
198-kilometer-long Shenbao and Shenhuang railways in northern
China's Hebei Province has been finished.
</P>
<P>
The third phase of the project, which has recently begun,
includes enhancement of current coal production capacity to 60
million tons, the building of the Huanghua harbor for shipping
coal and the construction of Huanghua power station.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the Shenhua Project by 2005 will dramatically
ease tensions in China's energy supply for a long time to come and
help promote expansion of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government attaches much importance to the project
and has granted preferential policies to the Shenhua Group, which
was organized in October 1995 to take charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
The group aims to help address the problems in China's
coal-production industry and develop into a giant multinational
group company that does business in different sectors such as
energy, transportation, finance and trade.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Urges OPEC Countries To Unite In Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called on member countries of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain their unity a time when
they are faced with both challenges and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to oil ministers from OPEC's 11 member states at the
closing ceremony of the 103rd OPEC Ministerial Meeting here,
Soeharto said the oil market is becoming increasingly competitive.
</P>
<P>
Oil-producing countries, including OPEC members, can no longer
expect a huge profit from a rise in oil prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the challenges awaiting OPEC members in developing the
oil industry are becoming more difficult to cope with, although
energy tax policies are being adopted, particularly by developed
countries, to preserve the environment.
</P>
<P>
One of the challenges is the rapid development of various types
of non-oil energies, including new and renewable energies. The
increasingly high production of non-OPEC nations poses another
challenge, Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, it is a challenge in itself for OPEC member
states to maintain the present level of production, while
preserving their reserves.
</P>
<P>
Despite these challenges, chances remain open to continue oil
development and OPEC can play an even greater role in it, he said.
</P>
<P>
The far greater oil reserves of OPEC members compared to
non-OPEC countries allow OPEC members to raise production and this
will go on for a long period, Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
"Oil also remains dominant for a relatively long time, due to
its superior character unchallenged by other energy sources," he
added.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's Secretary General Dr. Rilwanu Lukman told a press
conference later that the OPEC meeting, which started on November
26, has decided to raise the OPEC production ceiling for the first
half of 1998 to 27.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from the
current 25.033 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also unanimously elected Indonesian Mines and
Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana as OPEC's President for six
months and extended the tenure of Lukman as Secretary General for
another three years, effective from 1st January 1998.
</P>
<P>
The ministers reviewed the secretary general's report, the
report of the Economic Commission Board, the report of the
Ministerial Monitoring Subcommittee and various administrative
matters.
</P>
<P>
The conference also approved the budget of the organization for
the year 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lukman said resolutions adopted at the conference will be
published on December 29, after ratification by member countries.
</P>
<P>
The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be held in
Vienna on June 24, 1998, said Lukman.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nations Meet to Seek Ways of Curbing Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. climate conference opened
today in Kyoto, Japan, to explore ways of curbing global warming,
Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day conference, attended by 5,000 delegates from some
170 countries, will seek to set greenhouse gas emission targets
for developed nations and discuss the role of developing countries
in the fight.
</P>
<P>
Tough negotiations are expected at the meeting as wide
differences remain on both issues.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Environment Agency chief Hiroshi Oki called for
forging a worldwide strategy to tackle global warming.
</P>
<P>
Japan said that industrialized nations should aim at 5 percent
as their basic but flexible target for cutting average annual
emissions from 1990 levels between 2008 to 2012.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse
gases, wants to stabilize such emissions at 1990 levels in the
specified period.
</P>
<P>
The European Union calls on these nations to cut greenhouse gas
emissions by 15 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo urged Washington to raise its reduction target but
regarded the EU proposal unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, produced mainly
through combustion of oil, coal and other fossil fuels, are blamed
for increasing the earth's temperature by trapping heat in the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have warned that global warming will cause frequent
occurrence of droughts, an increase in infectious diseases and a
rise in sea level which can submerge island countries.

<HEADLINE> Visitor Arrivals in S'pore May See Near Zero Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals in Singapore
may come to a standstill as the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is
expecting "near zero" growth in visitor arrivals this year, the
Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A "near zero" arrivals growth this year would be the lowest in
14 years, way below the earlier estimate of three to five percent
increase, it said.
</P>
<P>
The revision in forecast had been widely expected by industry
members given that in the first ten months this year, visitor
arrivals increased only by 1.2 percent compared with a year ago.
</P>
<P>
An STB spokesman was quoted as saying that due to the adverse
effects of the haze and the regional currency turmoil, the Board
could expect a near zero growth in visitor arrivals for 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, as for the industrial prospects for 1998, some market
analysts were not optimistic as they expect flat, if not negative,
growth in the year to come.
</P>
<P>
The Business Times report quoted a hotel consultant and
research analyst as saying that visitor arrivals next year might
be less than this year because spending had been pinched in the
key markets of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and South
Korea, all significant markets for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Another analyst was even looking at as low as a five percent
contraction in 1998 visitor arrivals, while the problem, the
report noted, was also compounded by a growing supply of hotel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
STB figures showed that the number of gazetted hotel rooms will
grow by another four percent in 1997, six percent in 1998, and
four to five percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
As a result, hotel occupancy is expected to fall to 75 percent
in 1998, down from 82 percent last year, the report said.

NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua)-- India and Bangladesh have
agreed to maintain a status quo in the disputed border areas till
a final decision on the issue, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
There are four disputed areas along the 856-km-long Indo-Bangla

These are Muhuri Char, Khowai, Feni and Jaleya in South and West
Tripura districts.
</P>
<P>
The decision to maintain status quo in the disputed areas was
taken recently at a five-day meeting between Indian Border
Security Forces (BSF) and Bangladesh Rifles. The meeting was held
in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, from October 14 to 18.
</P>
<P>
At the Dhaka meeting, while BSF officials expressed concern
that Indian militants setting up base camps in Bangladesh were
attacking the security forces and civilians of Tripura and other
northeastern states, the Bangladesh officials expressed their
anxiety over the smuggling of drugs from India into Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Geological formation of
Bangladesh is suitable for hydrocarbon deposit and the entire
eastern part of the country from Sylhet to the offshore areas in
Chittagong is very rich in gas deposits, according to Professor
Badrul Imam, chairman of the Geological Department of Dhaka
University.
</P>
<P>
Professor Imam disclosed this while giving a lecture in Dhaka
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All the geological preconditions required to hit gas were found
to be satisfactorily existing in eastern Bangladesh, local press
reports today quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that on an average drilling of three exploration wells
one was hitting gas in Bangladesh and in some cases drilling of
one well only was hitting gas. But the world average was that when
5 to 10 exploration wells were drilled, one hit gas, he added.
</P>
<P>
Imam noted out of 13.7 trillion cubic feet (about 383.6 billion
cubic meters) of proved gas in 21 gas fields in the country, 2.9
trillion cubic feet (about 81.2 billion cubic meters) was
recovered and used.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Economy Faces Threat of Collapse: Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The poor economy of Nepal
faces a threat of collapse unless the huge foreign capital is
invested in productive sectors, Nepali newspapers today quoted
economists as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nepal currently owes 160 billion rupees (about 2.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in foreign loans, which means 8,000 rupees (about 131
dollars) for each citizen, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
"The huge amount of foreign capital we have been drawing must
be used in productive sectors, otherwise our economy will
collapse," warned Dr. Yubaraj Khatiwada, an economic advisor with
the Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
MP Hari Rokka, an economist, also told a function organized by
the Nepal Relation Society that too much loans will "put us into
financial crisis" as 90 percent of Nepal's annual budget depends
on foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bal Gopal Vaidya, ex-member of Nepal's National Planning
Commission, said the loans Nepal owes increased twice due to the
consistent devaluation of the Nepali currency.
</P>
<P>
But "terrible situations will emerge if loans are stopped at
present," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's gross national product (GNP) in the fiscal year 1994-95
was 205.1 billion rupees (about 3.5 billion dollars), with per
capita GNP standing at 9,766 rupees (about 168 dollars).

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian President Backs Lanovy as Privatization Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
praised the work of acting Chairman of the State Property Fund
(SPF) Vladimir Lanovy and reassured the SPF head to remain in his
post, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
"Lanovy is a good professional, an honest and decent person
carrying out his duties in keeping the law," Kuchma said on
Wednesday. The SPF is the organization responsible for Ukraine's
privatization work.
</P>
<P>
The president's remark came less than a week after a
parliamentary resolution trying to stop privatization. Under the
resolution, privatization is not to go on until Kuchma names a
full head of the SPF, who must be approved by parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma also criticized legislators opposed to Lanovy's
appointment as formal head of the SPF, accusing some parliamentary
groups of using the SPF as a lever in their election
campaigns. Ukraine's parliamentary elections will be held in March
1998.
</P>
<P>
The president said that further debate over the leadership of
the SPF is useless because the present parliament can hardly find
a candidate to replace Lanovy.

NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- India's care-taker Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral today called upon all sections of
society in the country to be actively involved in AIDS awareness
activities on a continuing basis from the World AIDS Day on
December 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in his message to mark the World AIDS
Day throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Indian Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Renuka
Chowdhury said in her message that the epidemic of HIV-ADIS
continues to spread in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Today at least 70,000 people are HIV positive and about 5,000
have developed full blown AIDS. AIDS affects not just individuals
in our societies but the nation's economic productivity," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must confront the issues that lead to the spread of
HIV/AIDS with determination and compassion-determination to spread
awareness and encourage responsible personal behavior and
compassion for those suffering from HIV/AIDS," she said.
</P>
<P>
The first case of AIDS in India was registered in 1986. Since
then, HIV prevalence has been reported in all states and Union
territories.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the first case of AIDS was registered in the country
in 1986, a National AIDS Committee was set up and the government
launched the National AIDS Control Program in the following year
focusing on increasing awareness of HIV/AIDS, screening of blood
for HIV, and testing of individuals practicing risk behaviors.

<HEADLINE> Conference Appeals Jobs For AIDS Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 30 (Xinhua) -- When AIDS sufferers combat their
disease with new therapies and get significantly longer life
expectancy, they may also want to get back into normal jobs.
</P>
<P>
Italian organizations combating this disease will be thinking
about projects to help them return to work, which also means
breaking down the barriers of prejudice at the work place.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day conference on HIV positive here Saturday
in view of Monday's World AIDS Day, Fiore Crespi, newly elected
chairman of Anlaids, a leading anti-AIDS organization, announced
the creation of a permanent observatory for violations of the
rights of HIV positive and AIDS sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by 50 scientists from France,
Italy, Israel, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, the United States
and Switzerland. It was organized by UNESCO, the World AIDS
Research and Prevention Council, the Italian National Research
Council, and the National Health Institute.
</P>
<P>
The participants discussed survival of child AIDS sufferers,
the therapy for pregnant mothers and the problems of AIDS orphans.
</P>
<P>
Since the first reported death of a child by AIDS in Los
Angeles 15 years ago, almost three million children under 15 are
estimated to have caught the disease worldwide, and at least a
thousand are dying each day.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Urged to Aid More to HIV/AIDS Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government and private
sector have been urged to provide more financial help to those
infected by HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Dares Chusri, coordinator of the Non-governmental Organizations
Coalition on AIDS of Thailand, expressed concern that financial
support on activities related to the war on AIDS have shrunk.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government-sponsored NGO budget for AIDS has been cut
from 80 million baht (2 million US dollars) last year to 60
million baht (1.5 million dollars) this year, the Bangkok Post
today quoted her as saying on the occasion of World AIDS Day
today.
</P>
<P>
She said foreign donors have also diverted their support to
less-developed Indochinese countries.
</P>
<P>
She said if nothing is done to continue the fight against AIDS,
the number of HIV-positive people in Thailand could exceed 1.3
million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The official HIV-positive estimate at present is 800,000.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that of the one million children born annually
in the country, at least 20,000 will be born to HIV-positive
mothers. Of these, at least 20 percent will die before the age of
two, while the rest will risk social, economic and psychological
discriminations caused by their parents' AIDS status.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Cut Tariffs on Feed Raw Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Commerce Ministry will
reduce import tariffs on raw materials used in animal feed
production next year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tariff on soybean meal will be lowered to 3 percent from 5
percent, while that on fish meal with a protein content more than
60 percent will be reduced to 6 percent from 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry will scrape the 350 baht (8.75 U.S.
dollars) surcharge on fish meal per ton and the 180 baht (4.5
dollars) surcharge per ton on maize outside import quota.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's planned move to cut the tariffs is aimed at
lowering the animal feed cost and bringing down the prices on the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
According to the forecasts by the Internal Trade Department
under the ministry, Thailand's demand for animal feed would reach
11.94 million tons in 1998, up 3.84 percent from this year.
</P>
<P>
Demand for maize in 1998 will be up 1.2 percent year-on-year to
4.7 million tons, while demand for soybean will rise by 3.9
percent to 1.5 million tons and demand for fish meal will climb up
6 percent to 886,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Thailand needs to import some 551,000 tons of maize next year
as its maize output for the year is estimated at 4.15 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it currently plans to import 300,000
tons of maize initially at a zero tariff rate during a time limit
from January to June next year.
</P>
<P>
If that amount is not enough, the ministry will allow more
imports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also needs to import at least 800,000 tons of soybean
meal as its domestic output was estimated at only 691,524 tons.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the ministry had not set a limit on soybean
meal imports this year and this policy will continue next year,
except the tariff cut from 5 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Thailand is expected to import more than 415,000
tons of fish meal next year, as its domestic output was expected
to be merely around 470,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> China's Machinery Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Exports of machinery and
electrical products jumped 23.7 percent in the first nine months
of this year over the same period of 1996, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The increase suggests China's economic strength amid a
string of financial turmoil battering some Asian countries, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Central Administration of Customs show that
the trade volume of machinery and electrical products topped 80
billion U.S. dollars, up 9.2 percent from the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, exports hit 41.03 billion U.S. dollars, up 23.7
percent, while imported machinery and electrical products were
down 2.7 percent, standing at 39.03 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports of vessels, power generators and electric motors and
some electronics products saw dramatic double-digit rises while TV
sets, containers and electric fans shipped abroad declined
considerably.
</P>
<P>
The structure of exports improved greatly, with exports of such
high technology products as integrated circuits, micro-electronics
components, converters, motorcycles, and numerically controlled
machine tools growing sharply, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Imports of forklifts, elevators, food-processing machinery, and
rubber and plastics manufacturing equipment slumped
significantly. However, the imports of components for power
generating equipment and computer parts and semi-conductors
climbed to a new high, 6.6 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's main-season paddy
output is expected to reach 17.83 million tons next year, up 0.32
percent from this year despite the anticipated drought and
dwindling growing areas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hondurans Go to Polls, Opposition Complains of Irregularities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Hondurans voted today for
a new president while the opposition party complained of
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The voters will also choose three vice presidents, all 128
congressional deputies, 20 deputies to the Central American
parliament and 297 municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
Both front-runners in the presidential field of five candidates
are conservative. Carlos Flores Facusse from the ruling Liberal
Party is widely expected to win.
</P>
<P>
Nora de Melgar of the National Party is the first woman to seek
the presidency of this Central American nation of 5.8 million
people.
</P>
<P>
A CID-Gallup poll done last week put Flores at 48 percent
against Melgar's 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other presidential contenders include candidates from the
social democratic Party of Innovation and Unity (PINU), the
Christian Democratic Party (PDC), and for the first time, a
cluster of left-wing parties in the Democratic Unification (UD)
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The front runners have few political differences: both favor
conservative economic policies and populist social agendas, and
both have pledged to open the economy, decentralize the federal
government, and fight poverty and corruption.
</P>
<P>
A recent Gallup poll shows that 33 percent of Hondurans believe
that crime is the country's main problem. Nineteen percent believe
that poverty is more serious, and 14 percent said it was
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Flores, 47, is the current head of Congress. He is also owner
of La Tribuna, the highest circulation newspaper in the country.
</P>
<P>
Melgar, 56, is the widow of a general who overthrew a military
government in 1975. She comes from a wealthy ranching family and
is a former mayor of Tegucigalpa.
</P>
<P>
While no serious incidents were reported, Rafael Callejas, a
former president and leader of the opposition National Party, said
that some people who should have been ineligible to vote were
allowed to cast ballots because lists of people to be barred from
the election had not been delivered in time.
</P>
<P>
The National Election Tribunal (TNE) last week authorized
voters to use outdated identification cards after determining that
about 300,000 voters -- out of a total of 2.9 million -- would not
have their new cards in time to vote on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The new president will take office on January 27, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Hotels in Sanctuary Warned of Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan defense
authorities have cautioned hotel managers in the southern
sanctuary of Yala to be cautious of rebel infiltration following
the arrest of six Tamil rebel suspects Saturday, according to
reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The six, including a woman, were arrested by the security
forces in the Yala Wild Life Sanctuary, Southern province, where
rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had been
active during recent months.
</P>
<P>
Three of them could not produce their identity cards to police.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources said LTTE rebels were trying to infiltrate into
the Yala jungles and the Kataragama area in the south due to the
military offensives by government troops in the north.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry thus asked hotel managers in those areas
to be vigilant over suspicious people seeking accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Residents living around the sanctuary were also warned of rebel
activities in the area.
</P>
<P>
LTTE rebels had burnt down some of the bungalows in the
sanctuary, hijacked tourist vehicles and held wild life department
workers and fishermen in neighboring villages as hostages in the
past months.
</P>
<P>
Consequently the police and the Army launched a major operation
to flush out the rebels from the sanctuary.

DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's friendly relations
with India and Pakistan would remain unchanged despite the current
political development in New Delhi and Islamabad, State Minister
for Foreign Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is inappropriate, if not impertinent, to comment on the

The United News of Bangladesh (UNB) today quoted Chowdhury as
saying that "what dispensation or form of government they would
like to have is entirely a matter to be decided by themselves."
</P>
<P>
The state minister, however, deeply appreciated the role of
I.K. Gujral and said, "It is indeed his vision of peace and
stability in this region, which has immensely improved our
bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that this trend would continue, "not just between our
two countries but also in this region."

succeeded in making profits after paying off all debts will
receive front-page coverage of the country's leading newspaper

</P>
<P>
Anda was a newborn based on a big losing textile factory and
the only profit-making textile factory in Shanghai in June,
1996. Anda cut down the number of workforce by 40 percent and
reduced 36,000 spindles. By optimizing assets, Anda achieved
obvious economic returns.
</P>
<P>
-- The key lies on confidence, said People's Daily's front-page
commentary hailing Anda's practice. It believed that the 10
enterprises will give good examples of how to push forward reform
on state-owned enterprises and extricate them from difficult
positions.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Construction of comfort Housing to be Curbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Comfort housing scheme, a
nationwide program to provide basic housing for those with less
per capita living space, may be restricted as more vacant space
has emerged since the project's implementation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
By the first half of this year, completed floor space had
reached 5.03 million sq. m, according to statistics from the
Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
However, some 3.39 million sq. m. of the cheapest Comfort
housing remain vacant in June this year, accounting for 66 percent
of completed space, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shen Jianzhong, deputy director of the real estate department
of the Ministry of Construction said problems centered on lack of
affordability and poor quality projects.
</P>
<P>
Although the price of Comfort housing is limited to 1,000 yuan
per sq. m., only about four percent of China's urban households
earn more than 5,000 yuan a year. It will take more than 10 years
for those benefiting under the Comfort scheme to buy a home with a
floor space of 55 sq. m., he added.
</P>
<P>
Comfort housing should be limited to a suitable scale when the
residential housing reform is intensified, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
Given favourable policies and lower prices, Comfort houses
would have been sold out, said an expert.
</P>
<P>
Comfort housing scheme benefits from a series of preferential
policies in terms of bank loans and land use, It has been
introduced in 232 cities with a total designated floor space of
42.15 million sq. m. Buyers of Comfort housing must be below a
certain level of household income, which differs according to the
local government areas.

<P>
BANGKOK, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Beginning today, the Stock
Exchange of Thailand (SET) will allow the price of each stock to
rise or fall by up to 30 percent a day, an increase from the
former 10-percent limit.
</P>
<P>
All trading will halt for one hour if the main SET index falls
in a day by 100 points from the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
Stock market analysts believe that the new rules will make
playing stocks more risky than ever.
</P>
<P>
SET President Singh Tangtatswas said at weekend that the new
regulations "increase the chances for both profits and gains" but
also warned investors that they must be well prepared before they
enter the market.
</P>
<P>
SET regulators insisted that the wider daily price-movement
ceilings and floors for common stocks are necessary for long-term
development of the market, but also cautioned that retail
investors should closely monitor price trends to prevent sudden
losses.
</P>
<P>
Paiboon Ratniyom, an analyst with Asia Securities Trading, said
that while the expanded trading limits are unlikely to spur the
market out of its sluggishness, the changes will bring the SET
closer to international practices.
</P>
<P>
However, in order to curb wild downturns on the market, new
"circuit breakers" will be implemented at the SET beginning today.
If the SET index falls more than 100 points from the previous
day's close, all trading will be temporarily halted for one hour.
</P>
<P>
If the index drops more than 150 points, a delay of 90 minutes
will be imposed; and trading will be canceled for the rest of the
day if the index falls more than 200 points.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predicted that little immediate change will occur
on the market from the new trading regulations, as investors are
already too skittish and gloomy because of the country's economic
crash and poor corporate earnings prospects.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that foreign investors are not expected to see the
rule changes as new incentives to enter the market, considering
the present overall market and exchange risks.
</P>
<P>
Last week the SET index mostly stayed just a few points below
the 400-points mark, the lowest level since the SET was founded
two decades ago. On Friday, the SET index was 395.47 points, down
3.96 points from the previous day.

<P>
Hong Kong, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Presidium of the
Conference for Electing Deputies of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) of China is meeting here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by Tung Chee Hwa, executive chairman of the Presidium,
the 11 Presidium members are expected to review the 72 nominees to
run for the 36 NPC deputies and discuss a proposed list of
scrutineers and other matters related to the election.
</P>
<P>
A list of candidates for the NPC deputies is expected to be
made public after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
By November 28, the deadline set for the nomination of HKSAR
deputies to Ninth NPC, 72 people had been nominated for the
election of the 36 deputies. They had each obtained nomination by
at least 10 members of the 424-strong Election Conference.
</P>

According to the Election Method, as the number of nominees
exceeds the number to be elected by more than one-half, a
preliminary round of election will take place on December 6 to
decide the 54 official candidates. The final election is scheduled
for December 8.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels to Sign Peace Pact Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to sign
a preliminary peace agreement by Christmas, and a final peace
treaty before June 30 next year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This agreement was reached Saturday during a meeting in central
Mindanao between the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Jose
de Venecia, and the MILF vice chairman for military affairs,
Mohammad al-Haj Murad, the national newspaper Today said.
</P>
<P>
Murad was quoted as saying after the meeting that he agreed in
principle the timetable and confirmed the advanced stage of the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Murad headed the MILF panel that held talks in the largest MILF
stronghold, Camp Abubakar, with de Venecia and his party, which
included Orlando Soriano, chief government negotiator in peace
talks with the MILF.
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely optimistic about reaching a preliminary
understanding before Christmas this year to advance the ongoing
peace process," de Venecia was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the preliminary agreement, the MILF-controlled areas in
central and western Mindanao will be transformed into special
development zone, another newspaper Malaya reported.
</P>
<P>
Malaya quoted Murad as saying the MILF leadership will meet
from December 15 to 17 to finalize its position in preparation for
the next round of peace talks with the government panel on
December 22 and 23.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government started their exploratory peace
talks in January this year, and reached a breakthrough in July
when both sides signed a comprehensive ceasefire in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
During the last round of peace talks in November, the two sides
signed an accord on principles and rules for implementing the
truce agreement, laying the groundwork for further mutual
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), which had already signed a peace accord
with Manila in September last year.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, who has sought to establish a separate Islamic state
in Mindanao, refused to be included in the MNLF-Manila peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest Muslim rebel force in the
country, with an estimated 12,000 fighters.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan's Constitutional Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The current constitutional
crisis in Pakistan seems to be worsening as the president and the
prime minister are now openly on a collision path.
</P>
<P>
A power tussle between President Farooq Leghari and Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif assumed new proportions last night when
Sharif openly accused the Presidency of "not extending assistance
in the parliament's efforts to preserve constitution."
</P>
<P>
In his 25-minute televised speech to the nation, Sharif said
his government passed Amendment in the Contempt of Court Law to
steer the country out of the further crisis but the president
refused to sign it.
</P>
<P>
"Crisis could be averted if the president signed the bill.
However, he (Leghari) refused to sign the law, passed by the two
houses of the Parliament."
</P>
<P>
The parliament passed the bill on November 18 in an apparent
effort to protect Sharif who was formally charged with contempt of
the court the next day by a Supreme Court bench led by Chief
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.
</P>
<P>
The bill was forwarded on November 18 to Leghari, who has a
maximum of 30 days to sign it. However, there has been no response
from him.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the political situation in this south
Asian nation is worsening when the two constitutional heads -- the
president and the prime minister -- refuse to co-exist contrary to
the demand of the prevalent political system.
</P>
<P>
The two exchanged strongly-worded letters following an assault
last Friday by hundreds of demonstrators on the Supreme Court
where a five-judge bench led by Chief Justice Sajjad was hearing a
petition against the prime minister on the alleged contempt of the
court.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Justice asked the president to provide army's
protection for the Supreme Court building and its judges.
</P>
<P>
It was in this context that Leghari wrote a letter to Sharif,
advising him to "immediately ask the Pakistan Army to provide
security cover to the Supreme Court building and to provide safety
and protection to the judges and their residences."
</P>
<P>
Leghari also asked Sharif to initiate proceedings for
misconduct against Justice Saeed Uzzaman Siddiqui, the third most
senior judge in the Supreme Court who has called for a full-court
hearing against the controversial appointment of the Chief
Justice.
</P>
<P>
However, Leghari's two pieces of advice were rejected by
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Sharif accused Leghari of taking sides with the
judiciary in the on-going constitutional crisis involving the
country's executive and the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
"There is surely no justification for making such an extreme
request (for army protection). In fact arrangements for adequate
security have already been made," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
"I also regret your request for proceedings to be initiated
against Saeed Uzzaman Siddiqui merely because that is the demand
of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah," he wrote to Leghari.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the grave constitutional crisis took another
dimension as two conflicting schedules were issued for today's
Supreme Court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
One schedule suggested the holding of a five-member bench to
hear the contempt of court case against Sharif and others, while
the other said a full court comprising 15 judges will hear the
pending cases against the appointment of Chief Justice Sajjad.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Justice issued an order Sunday evening cancelling the
full court meeting to hear a constitutional petition against him.
</P>
<P>
However, hours after the Chief Justice's order, Justice
Siddiqui issued a press release saying he declined to accept
Sajjad's order because it "amounts to interference with judicial
process."
</P>
<P>
There in fact exist two supreme courts: one headed by Chief
Justice Sajjad and the other by Justice Siddiqui. Both are
scheduled to meet today as official notifications for the two
meetings have already been issued.
</P>
<P>
The judicial confusion has further complicated the political
situation in the country, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
While the differences between Leghari and Sharif have come out
into the open, the president, whom the government has indirectly
held responsible for the current crisis, has remained silent.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers have printed stories about the government's
plans to impeach the president, but the two have refrained from
assailing each other directly.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts believed that the president and the prime
minister are heading for a showdown after the two made their
divergent positions public in their exchange of letters.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Italy will start repatriating
illegal Albanian immigrants Monday in accordance with a directive
signed by Italian Prime Minister Romao Prodi.
</P>
<P>
The premier said when signing the directive that the
repatriation operation would not be postponed.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the repatriation was to begin, tension was running
high among 524 illegal Albanians in Puglia because they were
unclear how the operation was to be carried out and how long it
would take.
</P>
<P>
Many said that they had the necessary requisites to obtain a
sojourn permit, either because they were to join family members in
Italy, or because they had work contracts, or because they needed
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
A young woman, speaking for around 150 Albanians at Cassano
Murge, near Bari, announced that they would stage a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
Waves of Albanians began to flood the coasts of Puglia in
March. Many have since left but 4,789 Albanians without proper
documents still remain in Italy, according to the Interior
Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Weaker Peso Raises Philippine Debt Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Payments by the Philippines on
its foreign debts this year are projected to rise by 16 percent
owing to the depreciated peso and rising interest rates abroad.
</P>
<P>
In a government document published today, the country's foreign
debt payments are seen to rise to 5.8 billion U.S. dollars this
year, compared with 5 billion dollars paid last year.
</P>
<P>
The document said interest payments were particularly higher in
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The currency crisis, which has weakened the peso by as much as
30 percent since July, has made it more expensive for the country
to pay off its foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
Of the projected external debt service this year, about 57
percent or 3.3 billion dollars will go to the payment for the
principal of the debts while the balance of 2.5 billion dollars
will be paid for the interest.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the country paid some 2.72
billion dollars in foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
The document also showed that foreign debt payments by the
country's private and public sectors are seen to average between
5.9 billion dollars and 7 billion dollars annually in the next
five years.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items In Leading Australian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister John Howard stepped up pressure on the Senate
yesterday to fix the native title issue immediately, appealing
directly in his first national address for community support for
the government's Wik bill. The bill, which the government is
determined to push through the Senate, is regarded by Australian
aboriginal leaders as unfair to the aborigines.
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian Defense Force will dramatically upgrade its
air and naval strike and self-defense capabilities under a
multi-billion dollar plan to be outlined tomorrow in the federal
government's first strategic policy document.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Searing summer temperatures, severe flooding and mudslides
will become common over vast tracts of North Asia, Latin America
and Africa if carbon dioxide levels are not controlled within 50
years, a Japanese-Australian study has found.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Papua New Guinea's five month-old coalition government was
yesterday on the verge of falling apart, split by bribery
allegations and claims of backstabbing, which led to the sacking
of two key ministers by Prime Minister Bill Skate.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The seriousness of the problems besetting North Asian
economies was foreshadowed by an unannounced Australian Treasury
decision two years ago to abandon its debt swap arrangements with
Japanese banks.

<HEADLINE> Safeguarding Foreign Citizen's Rights Noted in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
has stepped up an education campaign resently on the Vienna
Convention to remind the nation's law-enforcement officials that
foreign citizens arrested have the right to let their government
know it.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was renewed following periodic complaints from
diplomatic officials and defense lawyers that many law-enforcement
agents in the United States know little or nothing about the
treaty, The New York Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, ratified by
more than 160 countries including the United States, foreign
nationals taken into custody in one country must be told that they
can notify their home country's embassy or local consulate. In
some cases, embassies must be notified of such arrests
automatically.
</P>
<P>
The United States embassies rely on the treaty as a critical
protection for American citizens in trouble with the law abroad.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Mexican government lodged formal
complaints to the U.S. State Department this year that the latter
had not inform it the arrests and execution of a number of Mexican
citizens in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Recently the State Department briefed about 100 police chiefs
and other law-enforcement agents in Texas State about the right of
foreign citizens under the Vienna Convention.
</P>
<P>
Those who were briefed also received a brochure that explained:
"When foreign nationals are arrested or detained, they must be
advised of the right to have their consular officials notified,"
the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Cities Use Youth Curfews: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- More cities in the United
States are using nighttime and daytime youth curfews to reduce
crime and truancy.
</P>
<P>
A survey to be released here Monday by the U.S. Conference of
Mayors found that 276 of 347 responding cities had a nighttime
curfew. Seventy-six had a daytime curfew as well, The Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
A similar survey the mayors group did in 1995 showed 270 of 387
cities had a nightly curfew.
</P>
<P>
"Curfews are not the end-all. It's just one tool in the
toolbox," said Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson, chairman of the
mayors' conference task force on youth violence.
</P>
<P>
Abramson said curfews should be just one part of a juvenile
crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 56 percent, or 154, of the surveyed
cities have had a youth curfew for at least 10 years. Officials in
half these cities say juvenile crime has dropped since the curfew
was imposed, 11 percent say the number of juvenile crimes has
remained steady, and 10 percent have had an increase in
juvenile-related crime. Because most of the remaining cities have
had curfews for only a short time, no data on the impact on
juvenile crime was available.
</P>
<P>
The most important reason for a daytime curfew is to ensure
teens go to school, but Abramson said there are financial
incentives as well. State education funding typically is based on
attendance, he noted, and truancy can cost a school system
millions of dollars in lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
But curfews can be expensive for cities, too. Twenty-three
percent, or 61, of the cities said there were increased costs to
enforce curfews.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three percent of cities reported problems implementing
the curfew.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen cities said there had been constitutional challenges
to the curfew. The American Civil Liberties Union has fought such
laws in a number of cities on the grounds that they impinge on
liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. It suggests cities use
the money spent enforcing curfews on youth programs instead.

<HEADLINE> French Aid Worker Killed in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A 28-year-old French aid worker
who was taken hostage by Tajik rebels was killed today in an army
operation to free her and her friend, said reports from
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Karine Mane, 28, who worked for the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees and for a European program for helping street
children in former Soviet republics, was kidnapped on November 18
in her home in Dushanbe by an armed group commanded by Rizvon
Sadirov, who asked for the release of the latter's brother Bakhrom
Sadirov, imprisoned for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tajik Foreign Ministry, the Tajik army
intervened to liberate Mane and her friend, Franck Janier-Dubry,
after the kidnappers hardened their conditions for releasing them.
Janier-Dubry was freed safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
The French government immediately expressed sadness over the
death of Mane, and President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin sent messages of condolences to the family of Mane.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that there is no
reason to think that the Tajik authorities have not done all they
could to have the two hostages freed safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said that he was not
sure about the conditions under which Mane was killed during the
army operation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the death of Mane "posed the question on the
conditions under which are exposed sometimes the people who are
carried by a magnificent ideal within the framework of
non-governmental organizations."

<HEADLINE> France Promises Cooperation with Spain Against ETA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin today promised to discuss profoundly with Spanish leaders
bilateral cooperation to fight the terrorism perpetuated by the
Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
Jospin made the statement to the Spanish newspaper El Periodico
de Catalunya on the eve of the Franco-Spanish summit to be held on
Monday and Tuesday in the Spanish city of Salamanque.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the 11th between France and Spain, will be focused
on European construction and anti-terrorist cooperations.
</P>
<P>
The French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement also said
in an interview with the Spanish daily ABC that ETA can no longer
consider France as a refuge or sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
He said that 140 ETA activists were arrested in France in 1996
and 53 arrested in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The last time France granted the status of political refugee to
ETA members was in 1986 and there is now only one ETA member who
lives legally as a political refugee in France, said Chevenement.
