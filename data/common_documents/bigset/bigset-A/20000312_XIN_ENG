<HEADLINE> Iran Hails Outcome of Arab Foreign Ministers' Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Sunday praised the outcome of the just-
concluded conference of Arab foreign ministers in Beirut as a major
step to support the Lebanese resistance against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Adopting a policy to confront the threats posed by Israel to
regional states "will serve to remove the danger and support the
interests of the nations in the region," Asefi was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers in their final resolutions issued at the
end of the one-day conference on Saturday strongly condemned Israel
for its continued occupation of south Lebanon and aggressions
against the Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
They also urged countries involved in multilateral negotiations
with Israel to reconsider their participation in the talks until
bilateral peace talks made substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the stance taken by the Arab foreign
ministers would have positive impact on the interests of the
regional states.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Muslim world would exercise more
solidarity in helping Lebanese, Syrians and the Palestinians regain
their territories, which were seized by Israel in the Middle East
wars.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which refused to recognize Israel since its establishment
in 1948, insists on military struggle against Israeli occupation of
Arab and Islamic lands.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the Lebanese resistance groups, particularly
Hezbollah, enjoyed military support from Tehran, but Iranian
officials have always denied arms supplies to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-claimed aim of protecting its northern territories from cross-
border guerrilla attacks. Since then, Hezbollah guerrillas have
been fighting to oust the Israeli forces and the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) from the country.
</P>
<P>
The clashes between Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrillas in
the security zone have escalated step by step since the beginning
of this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Blockades West Bank Cities to Hunt Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) placed a
number of blockades at the entrances of West Bank cities in an
effort to apprehend two activists of the militant Islamic group
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The IDF soldiers examined Palestinian citizens and their cars
carefully at the blockades, hindering the students and workers from
going to schools, universities and work places, according to Voice
of Palestine radio.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were carrying lists of names to compare them with
the ID cards of the passengers at the blockades, said eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister of Internal Security Shlomo Ben-Ami said two
members of the Hamas cell that clashed with Israeli security forces
in the Arab city of Taibeh, north of Tel Aviv, last week, were
still at large.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli security agents, the Hamas cell was
planning a terrorist attack when Israeli commandos stormed into
their hotbed and killed four of its members on March 2.
</P>
<P>
The IDF believes the remaining two members have two or three
bags each containing 10 kilograms of explosives and urges Israeli
citizens to keep vigilant, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
There was a massive Israeli police presence inside the so-called
Green Line, the former divider between Israel and the West Bank, on
Sunday in highly populated areas and around shopping centers to
prevent potential bomb attacks.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Pilgrims Ready for Journey of Faith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 1.8 million pilgrims
gathered in the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia are preparing to
head to Mina Tuesday for the first ritual of their mass trip of
faith.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims, of which 1.1 million are from outside of Saudi
Arabia, will cover the 11-kilometer journey on foot, reports
reaching here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ritual in Mina is called the Day of Al-Tarwiya, a word used
in the days of the Prophet Mohammad for stocking enough water for
the journey to Mount Arafat and the Valley of Mozdalifa.
</P>
<P>
The mass journey on Tuesday is considered a great challenge to
Saudi traffic police, as all the pilgrims must reach Mina before
the noon prayers.
</P>
<P>
Policemen will use helicopters and sophisticated communication
system to monitor the moving crowds in order to facilitate the
procession, said the Saudi authorities.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims on Wednesday will start to climb Mount Arafat, site
of the Prophet Mohammad's last sermon 14 centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
At Mount Arafat, the mass recitation of prayers marks the climax
of the Hajj pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, the pilgrims will begin to return to Mina
after a series of rituals in the Valley of Mozdalifa.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims will spend their night in Mina in the 40,000 fire-
proof tents erected by Saudi government with a total cost of 2.4
billion riyals (640 million U.S. dollars). Saudi officials have
said the tents can accommodate more than 2 million pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
Some 2 million Saudi and foreign pilgrims performed Hajj rituals
in Mecca and Mina in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Start Five-Year Plan Next Year: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will start a five-year plan
for the first time for developing economy since the sweeping U.N.
sanctions were imposed on the country in 1990, an official said
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to Hasan Abdul Munem Al-Khatab, chairman of the Iraqi
Planning Committee, the five-year plan will start from 2001 to
2005, during which Iraq will launch a series of new projects in the
fields of housing, urban development and etc..
</P>
<P>
The projects delayed by Iraq's eight-year war with Iran and the
decade-long U.N. sanctions will also be considered, said Al-Khatab.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the five-year plan does not necessarily
mean that specific industrial or agricultural projects will be
accomplished during the period.
</P>
<P>
The main goal of the plan, according to Al-Khatab, is to raise
economic growth and the national income through investments in
social, cooperative and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose the amount of funds the government is to
allocate for the five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the U.N. sanctions were in force, Iraq cancelled its
ministry of planning, and hence stopped disclosing its economic
figures to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Actually, due to the stringent sanctions, almost all of the
economic activities of Iraq were within the framework of the U.N.
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The program allows Iraq to sell a certain amount of oil and use
part of the revenue, under the U.N. supervision, to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies to help offset the impacts
of the sanctions on the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Sea Launch Fails to Put U.S. Satellite Into Orbit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. communications satellite
launched early Sunday by a Zenit-3Sl rocket failed to reach its
planned orbit, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ICO communications satellite blasted off from a floating
Sea Launch platform near the equatorial Christmas Island at 17:49
Moscow Time (14:49 GMT), failed to attain the necessary speed to
achieve its planned trajectory, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, built by the U.S. Hughes company, was to
function as the first in an orbiting group of 12 making up a
global mobile communications system.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's botched launch could delay the commissioning of the
system, which was projected to become operational in the second
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Sea Launch international consortium includes Boeing of the
U.S. with a 40 percent stake, Russia's Energiya Space Corporation
with a 25 percent stake, and Ukraine's Yuzhnoye design bureau and
Yuzhmash enterprise holding 15 percent. Kvaerner of Norway has a
stake of 20 percent, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait: Arabs Preparing to Hold Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime
Minster and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah said on
Sunday that three Arab ministers are making preparations for
holding an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Sabah made the announcement upon return from the Lebanese
capital of Beirut, where he attended the 113th meeting of the Arab
League Ministerial Council on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The tasked ministers, whom Sheikh Sabah did not identified, are
expected to invite Arab foreign ministers to put final touches on
preparations for the long-awaited summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, some Arab leaders have been trying to
bring together all the heads of Arab states to reconstruct their
solidarity diminished after the 1991 Gulf war sparked by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
But their efforts have so far born no results as some prominent
Arab states insists that any successful Arab summit should be
preceded by "good and sufficient preparations."
</P>
<P>
On the Beirut meeting, Sheikh Sabah said it "constitutes an
emphatic proof of the Arab states' support to Lebanon and standing
on its side in face of the Israeli aggressions."
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting reflected the fact that the Arabs are united
when facing dangers, he said. The final resolution of the meeting
condemned Israel's continued occupation of south Lebanon and its
aggressions against the Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
The document also called for Arab states involved in
multilateral negotiations to halt normalizing ties with Israeli
unless bilateral peace talks achieve concrete results.

<HEADLINE> Erekat Urges U.S. to Take Part in Interim Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat on Sunday urged the United States to effectively participate
in the coming Palestinian-Israeli talks on interim issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks on the implementation of the remaining provisions of
the interim stage under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum are expected
to be held on Monday or Tuesday in Washington, the Voice of
Palestine radio reported.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with U.S. Consul General in Jerusalem John
Herbest at the Palestinian Legislative Council in Ramallah on
Sunday, Erekat reviewed the latest developments of the Middle East
peace process on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
He held an unofficial meeting with Israeli chief negotiator Oded
Eran Saturday night in Jerusalem on the implementation of the Sharm
el Sheikh memo sign last September. Such an encounter was the first
between the two since talks on the Palestinian track were stalled
earlier last month.
</P>
<P>
Next week's talks were to cover the third phase redeployment of
Israeli troops in the 6.1 percent of West Bank territories, the
release of more Palestinian prisoners before the Muslim Greater
Bairam, the opening of the northern safe passage route and
bilateral financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian official said on Saturday that the redeployment
would be implemented within 10 days after the Greater Bairam which
falls on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nabil Abourdeneh, advisor to Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, said Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak set the date for the third redeployment during
their meeting in Tel Aviv last week. The meeting broke the deadlock
in the talks on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Under Sharm el Sheikh, the third withdrawal was slated for
January 20 but was delayed due to differences between the two sides
over the maps of the areas to be transferred to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Blames West for Separatism in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit on Sunday warned that his country was encountering
separatism-motivated terrorist movements "which are supported and
encouraged both by some of its neighbors and some of its allies."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the remarks on the state-run TRT television's "
Sunday Panorama" program, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is not rare for Ecevit to criticize certain neighbors, by
name or indirectly, for backing up terrorist organizations in
Turkey, but this apparently is the first time that he pointed an
accusing finger at Turkey's western allies on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a member of NATO, is striving for the membership of the
European Union in a bid to further develop its economy.
</P>
<P>
"There is a serious tradition of racism in Western Europe and
partly in Central Europe. The new coalition government in Austria
is not an exception. Those countries reacting against the Austrian
government, were in fact reflecting their own concerns that
negativities in their past could further develop in the future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit went on to say that European countries have witnessed "
fascist movements and ethnic genocides" in their history and "
Racist trends do not exist only in Austria."
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) Commission conducted a public poll on
16,000 people in EU member states two years ago and the poll
results showed that one third of the respondents were "extremely
racist" and one third of the questioned were "racist" ,he added.
</P>
<P>
However, "The concept of racism never existed in the Turkish
society. Discrimination against people due to their races and
ethnic backgrounds is impossible in Turkey. Turkey is the country
where people of different ethnic origins have been embracing each
other for centuries."|
</P>
<P>
Citing Turkey as an example, he stated, "When we examine results
of any general elections, we find that most of the deputies
(elected to the Grand National Assembly or Parliament) coming from
Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia are Kurdish. No one considers
this fact strange."
</P>
<P>
"Our citizens of Kurdish origin can become high-level officials
at all levels of the state, and no one needs to ask each other
their ethnic roots," he added.
</P>
<P>
On his meeting with Guenter Verheugen, EU Commissioner for
Enlargement, in Ankara Friday, Ecevit said that he raised the
matter to the EU official and asked European countries not to
interfere in Turkey's internal affairs, as each country has a
different approach in dealing with the issue of racism and ethnic
minorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the Great
Lakes Region and Horn of Africa started the regional conference on
proliferation of small arms on Sunday in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi to seek ways to curb the illegal arms trade.
</P>
<P>
The arms flow in the region, the most politically volatile in
Africa, has caused increased incidence of internal conflict, high
level of crime, violence and insecurity, Kenyan Foreign Minister
Bonaya Godana told the opening session.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts in Kenya's neighboring countries have resulted in the
massive smuggling of arms into the country, Godana noted.
</P>
<P>
He urged collaboration between the countries to address the
flow of illicit small arms in the region.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the United Nations, the Organization of
African Unity and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
also took part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that out of half of a billion illicit small
arms and light weapons in the world, 100 million are in Africa
alone, according to a recent U.N. report.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is taking measures to boost
leather and Footwear production and exports, Vietnam News Agency (
VNA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sector attained an export turnover of 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, a year-on-year increase of 36 percent, and it
plans to increase the figure to 1.5-1.6 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
In January, according to VNA, many leather and footwear
businesses signed sale contracts for the first half of the year.
And many buyers, including those from EU countries, continued to
order larger quantities of leather products from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vietnamese businesses are actively seeking foreign
partners and expanding the outlet for their products. However, the
industry is facing difficulties in purchasing quality materials
and it has seen a drop in the production of canvas shoes.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the growth rate in production, the sector will try
to seek more outlets and reorganize production in order to raise
its competitiveness in the world market.

LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Xia Xuanze scored a
surprise win over Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia to take the All
England badminton men's singles title at Birmingham, England, on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Xia, the 11th seed who entered the tournament little heralded,
pulled out the stunning victory over fourth seed Hidayat 15-6 15-
13, who is the runner-up for the second year running.
</P>
<P>
Xia took control from the start, going 11-0 ahead in the first

The 18-year-old Hidayat rebounded to level the game at 13-13,
but the Indonesian fightback turned out to be short-lived as the
tall Chinese swiftly slammed the door.
</P>
<P>
China were assured of a second singles title later in the day
with compatriots Dai Yun and Gong Zhichao doing battle in the
women's final.
</P>
<P>

ANKARA -- The Italian energy company, ENI, has signed an accord
with Russia's Gazprom on fiber optics projects connecting Russia to
Turkey and to other Asian and European points, reported the
Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The companies will evaluate the possibility of laying high-
capacity fiber optics cable from Russia to Turkey along a gas
pipeline under the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
Another fiber optics project under consideration would connect
Russia to Berlin and Helsinki, and possibly also to southern and
eastern Asia and Mediterranean Europe.
</P>
<P>
ENI's telecommunications partner in Italy, Albacom, already uses
optical fiber laid along Italy's gas network for telecommunications
and data transmission.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's foreign trade deficit in 1999 stood at 14.1
billion U.S. dollars, down 5.6 percent from a deficit of 18.94
billion dollars in 1998, the Anatolia News Agency reported on

said Oualalou Friday while meeting with a British envoy.
</P>
<P>
Morocco's debts to Britain are estimated at some 500 million
dollars. Morocco is Britain's largest trading partner in north
Africa, with a trade volume exceeding 3 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Riyadh-based Yanbu Industrial City has attracted

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes Communique of Arab Foreign Ministers' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Sunday welcomed the
communique of the 113th Arab foreign ministers' conference held in
Beirut on Saturday, which urged Arab states to halt normalizing
ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti cabinet, during its weekly session, spoke highly of
the communique, which also voiced support to Lebanon in face of
repeated Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
The one-day conference was originally planned in Cairo where the
Headquarters of the Arab League (AL) is based. The AL decided to
move the venue to Beirut to show Arab solidarity with and the
alliance's support to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The final resolutions of the conference, which were read by AL
Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid, strongly condemned
Israel for its continued occupation of south Lebanon and
aggressions against Lebanese territories.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers also urged countries involved in
multilateral negotiations with Israel to reconsider their
participation until bilateral peace talks made substantial
progress.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Al-
Jaber Al-Sabah attended the gathering of the foreign ministers of
the 22-member AL.
</P>
<P>
Before heading for Beirut on Friday, Al-Sabah had voiced support
to Lebanon in its struggle to regain the territories seized by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Kuwait will not establish diplomatic ties
with Israel as long as there exist occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self -claimed aim of protecting its northern territories from
cross-border guerrilla attacks. Since then, Lebanese Hezbollah, an
Iranian- and Syrian-backed muslim guerrilla group, has been
fighting to oust the Israeli occupation forces and the Israeli-
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
The fightings between Israeli-SLA troops and the Hezbollah
guerrillas in the security zone has been escalated step by step
since the beginning of this year.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Deputy Prime Minister
Ram Chandra Poudel stressed Sunday the need to develop indigenous
renewable energy such as hydropower to help rural people elevate
living standard and alleviate poverty.
</P>
<P>
If human management could be improved and water resources
harnessed, Nepal will see a great turning point in economic
development, said Poudel while inaugurating a day-long national
workshop on energy study with a view of giving the final shape to
a 20-year renewable energy plan.
</P>
<P>
"Energy brings dynamism, activity and liveliness, and
development, in other words, is dynamism and liveliness," he said.
</P>
<P>
A sustainable development in the country would be possible only
through the technology best suited to its natural, geographical
and social condition, said Poudel.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is a mountainous country which is rich in water resources
with the capacity of 83 million kilowatt in hydropower, of which
only about 3 percent have been tapped due to lack of money and
technology.

<HEADLINE> SADC Needs Peace for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's opposition
Democratic Part leader Tony Leon has stressed that peace is a
pre-requisite for foreign investment and economic growth in
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, South
African Press Association reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The SADC countries must fight to liberalize the economy of
southern Africa. To ride the global racing car toward prosperity,
our region needs peace, restrained fiscal policy, free trade and
the rule of law," Leon said in a seven-point proposal for economic
growth in SADC nations.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that SADC countries cut import tariffs and
corporate taxes, simplify tax schemes, keep revenue to a modest
share of gross domestic product, and privatize public services.
</P>
<P>
Leon also stressed that investors are only interested in a
state which uphold its obligations and protect their property
rights.
</P>
<P>
"SADC must provide the basis to build the credibility of its
member states in the eyes of global investors. The significance of
regional cooperation does not lie primarily with trade, but with
building credibility for, and enforcing adherence to, commitments
to economic and political reforms," Leon added.

<HEADLINE> Bayi Rockets Routs Shanghai Sharks 116-94 in CBA Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Bayi Rockets underscored their
status as five-time defending champions by blasting Shanghai
Sharks 116-94 in the first game of the best-of-five Finals in the
12-team Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) league here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
National center Wang Zhizhi led the attack of the visitors with
a game-high 37 points on 15-of-31 shooting. Power forward Liu
Yudong was another winning factor as he went 12-of-21 to
contribute 28 points.
</P>
<P>
Sharks, however, did not let the title holders feel comfortable
all the way as they came out aggressively and led 29-28 after the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
That guard Liu Wei was injured minutes into the second quarter
became the turning point for the home side, whose poor teamwork
thereafter cost them dearly.
</P>
<P>
Paced by experienced guard A Dijiang, Rockets capitalized on
the injury to pull away before they ended up 58-43 after the first
half.
</P>
<P>
"In the first quarter my side has done what they were told
before the game, but after Liu Wei was out with injury, our team
began to fell into disorder," said Liu Qiuping, head coach of the
Sharks.
</P>
<P>
"We also committed quite a few turnovers, and our shooting
percentage was poor," Li added.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the local crowds, Sharks tried to claw back into
the game from the third quarter on but Rockets replied with a
solid defense to hold off their fightback.
</P>
<P>
"We are familiar with their playing style. We can win as long
as we are faultless in defense and their attack have been blunted
by our defense," said Rockets' head coach Zhang Bin.
</P>
<P>
The 2.25-meter center Yao Ming scored 21 points and grabbed 17
rebounds but failed to save Sharks from the opening loss.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the match Rockets had a 48-of-99 shooting percentage
while Sharks went 38-of-90.

<HEADLINE> Barak Doubts of Resumption of Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak on Sunday expressed doubts about a soon resumption of the
peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly cabinet meeting, Barak said there is nothing new
on the Syrian peace track and it is still unclear whether and when
the talks will resume, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Barak also told his ministers that the resolution adopted by
foreign ministers of the Arab League in Beirut on Saturday did not
contribute to advancing peace in the region, including the reviving
of Israeli-Syrian talks.
</P>
<P>
A statement adopted at the one-day Arab League foreign ministers
conference calls on Arab countries to reconsider relations with
Israel and oppose a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League selected Beirut as the venue of the 113th
foreign ministerial conference in a strong show of Arab solidarity
with Lebanon in confrontation with Israel, which has been occupying
part of south Lebanon since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Amid increased Israeli casualties in south Lebanon and mounting
public call at home for immediate withdrawal, Israeli cabinet voted
unanimously on March 5 to pull out its troops from Lebanon by July,
with or without an agreement Lebanon and its powerbroker Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is seeking the full return of Golan Heights Israel
captured in the 1967 Mideast war and whose peace talks with Israel
hit an impasse again in January after resumed in last December,
firmly opposed the Lebanon issue is solved separately from Syria.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track, Barak said that the cabinet will
approve the maps of Israeli troops withdrawal from another 6.1
percent of the West Bank land in the next two weeks. The pullout
mandated in a September interim peace deal should have taken place
on January 20.
</P>
<P>
However, he declared that Jerusalem will remain Israel's
undivided capital forever and the government will not hand over the
three Arab villages near Jerusalem to full Palestinian rule as
demanded by the Palestinians at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dis, one of the three West Bank Arab villages now under
partial Palestinian control, has been suggested by Israel as a
possible capital of the future Palestinian state if the status of
Jerusalem is not decided in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem, together with those of Jewish
settlements, borders, Palestinian refugees should be decided by
September 13 this year when a permanent peace treaty between Israel
and the Palestinians is sealed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks are to resume later this
month in Washington after a month of suspension thanks to the
mediation of the U.S. and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Washington talks between Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser
Abed Rabbo and his Israeli counterpart Oded Eran are expected to
cover disputes in the interim period and the final status talks,
which need to be solved so that the two sides can reach a permanent
peace deal by September.

A deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), in session
since last Sunday, Huang predicted that the composite index at the
Shanghai Stock Exchange would hit 10,000 points in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
An accelerated pace in China's reform and opening up and a
strong momentum in economic growth constitute a solid, long-term
foundation on which the stock market would score new highs.
</P>
<P>
Economists noted that China's economy is entering a stage of
substantial restructuring and industrial elevation, which will
pave the way for a considerable expansion in the two bourses in
Shanghai and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Favorable factors sustaining fast economic growth lie in the go-
ahead of a proactive fiscal policy, flexible monetary policies, a
series of policies to stimulate consumption, incentives to spur
export and attract overseas investment, and a strategy to jump-
start development in China's western areas.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Iranian Reformist in Coma After Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Saeed Hajjarian, a close aide to
Iranian moderate President Mohammad Khatami, was shot in an
apparent assassination attempt Sunday morning and is still in coma
in a Tehran hospital.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, a member of the Tehran Municipal Council and managing
director of the reformist Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning) daily, was
shot by two unidentified gunmen outside the city hall at about 08:
35 a.m. (0505 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, another council member who saw the
shooting, said that two men aboard a motorcycle stopped briefly in
front of the council building and fired at Hajjarian.
</P>
<P>
"The assailant targeted Hajjarian's temple, but since his hand
trembled the bullet hit Hajjarian's face," Tabatabaei said.
</P>
<P>
The assailants fled the scene immediately, but some witnesses
have seen their faces, which would be helpful in identifying the
attackers, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) said.
</P>
<P>
So far no individuals or group have claimed responsibility for
the attack.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the hospital are sparing no efforts to save
Hajjarian's life, with one bullet entering through his left cheek
and remaining lodged at the back of his neck, IRNA quoted Dr.
Mohammad Reza Zafarqandi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The head of the emergency team said Hajjarian, who is in a coma,
needs more time for observation before a statement can be released
on his condition.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the city council official, who had respiratory
problems when arriving at the hospital, is now breathing better
with the help of a respirator.
</P>
<P>
The base of Hajjarian's brain is currently swollen as the
bullet's trajectory was close to the brain, he disclosed, adding
that no surgery has yet to be performed and the emergency team
considered it was to early to consider any surgery to remove the
bullet.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami, who is currently on an inspection tour to the
central Yazd province, strongly condemned the attempted
assassination and ordered the authorities to track down the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
"These terrorists resort to such ugly acts because they have no
place among the people and because the people hate them," the
state-run television quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iranian police have started to search for the two gunmen who
fled on a 1000-cc motorcycle, which is banned in Iran except for
use by police and security personnel.
</P>
<P>
Deputy police commander Brigadier General Mohsen Ansari said
that policemen have found a bullet at the shooting place and some
clues of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, former deputy intelligence minister, is a central
council member of the reformist Islamic Iran Participation Front
(IIPF) led by Mohammad Reza Khatami, the younger brother of
President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The IIPF and its reformist allies won an overwhelming victory in
the February 18 parliamentary elections, seizing control of Majlis
(parliament) from conservatives, who pushed strict theocratic rule
in Iran and opposed Khatami's reform drive.
</P>
<P>
Before the sensitive polling that was widely seen as a chance to
break conservatives' tight control over the country's major
government organs, Hajjarian called for a "house-clearing" in the
country, an ancient tradition before the Iranian new year on March
21, in order to facilitate reform programs of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the incident, Head of Iranian Presidential Office
Mohammad Ali Abtahi and some parliamentarians rushed to Hajjarian's
bedside.
</P>
<P>
The shooting took place following what Hajjarian's associates'
said a number of threats on the reformist's life by some hardline
extremists.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Sobh-e Emrouz newspaper said that their offices
in Urumieh, West Azarbaijan province, were attacked on Friday by a
group of people. The broke windows, poured petrol in the houses and
set fire to them, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The daily has published a series of reports on the political
killings of Iranian opposition leaders and dissident writers at the
end of 1998, in which some agents of the Intelligence Ministry,
including a former deputy minister, were involved.
</P>
<P>
Iran's State Security Council, a branch of the Supreme National
Security Council, held an emergency meeting on the incident and a
special team has been formed to investigate the event.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which is
responsible for supervising the country's mass media, strongly
condemned the assassination attempt against Hajjarian.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that Hajjarian was the target
of those who oppose freedom and stressed that the development of
democracy in Iran could never be stopped by shooting.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Southern States Governors Dissuaded From Meeting After Sharia Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Governors of Nigeria's Christian
dominated southern states Saturday cancelled their meeting in
Enugu State due to pressure from President Olusegun Obasanjo's
government.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Sunday quoted the Enugu State government
 statement as saying that the meeting was cancelled for
"unavoidable reason".
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the controversial Islamic law Sharia in
the Moslem dominated north was expected to be on top of the agenda
of the cancelled meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The presidency has not said they should not meet, but that
they ought to realize that because of the prevailing situation in
the country, the meeting is capable of causing panic," said an
official with the Enugu State government.
</P>
<P>
Aside from its perceived unfavorable effect on the polity, the
presidency told the governors that they could unwittingly play
into the hands of elements bent on the disintegration of the
country, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had been scheduled since January and that it was
designed to boost economic, social and cultural co-operation
between the 11 southern states of the west African country.
</P>
<P>
However, following recent riots between Christians and Moslems
over the implementation of Sharia and the meeting of the
south-east governors which called for confederacy as a way to
tackle incessant ethnic and religious clashes in the country, the
federal government apparently thought the parley could send wrong
signals, said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Oldest Vessel Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Shipping Lines
(ESL) has sold its oldest ocean-going vessel Meskerem for about
150,000 U.S. dollars, the Capital weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meskerem, with dead weight of 3,276 tons and gross registered
tonnage of 5,786, was under the ESL's ownership for the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
She stayed out of line since June 1998 due to technical
defaults, and had been docked at the port of Djibouti before it
was sold to its new Yemeni Somali owner in early February.
</P>
<P>
The ESL was forced to pay about 3,000 dollars daily when
Meskerem was docked at Djibouti port, sources of the state-owned
shipping company was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Currently the ESL calls 35 ports with 11 vessels although
Ethiopia has become a land-locked country since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Nine People Killed in Fighting in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The fighting for control of
Lower Shabelleh region between the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA)
militiamen and those in the area supported by the Islamic courts
has left nine people dead Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports reaching here the attack was launched
simultaneously on two different fronts by the militiamen in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The major front line is the Gayweyneh Village, some 12
kilometers north of Kurtunwarrey District.
</P>
<P>
Gayweyneh Village has recently been used as a militia base by
the RRA from where they had launched their attacks on the
strategic bridge of Kurtunwarrey District.
</P>
<P>
Nearly four battle wagons and over 100 heavily armed militiamen
from both sides were involved in this fighting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the RRA militiamen based in Gayweyneh
Village have first made the attack in revenge for an earlier small
scale assault against the village by the militiamen of Islamic
courts two days ago.
</P>
<P>
As the exchange of the heavy gunfire continued for a while, the
RRA fighters have begun retreating backward.
</P>
<P>
Some people said the RRA fighters have ran out of ammunition,
but others said they just have been over powered normally.
Nonetheless, the fighting has subsided after the Gayweyneh militia
base of the RRA has fallen in hands of the militiamen in the area.

<P>
TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Olympic field hockey hopeful
Malaysia remained on track for a berth in the Sydney Games after
they fought back to force a 4-4 draw with Argentina in Group B of
a qualifying tournament at Osaka on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Argentina appeared to have the match against Malaysia wrapped
up when a hat-trick from ace striker Jorge Lombi gave them a 4-2
lead by the sixth minute of the second half.
</P>
<P>
But Malaysia did not give up as they successfully staged a
comeback in which they not only drew level, but also thwarted four
Argentinian penalty corners in the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Spain remained Group B leaders after they blanked Switzerland 3-
0 to amass seven points from three matches.
</P>
<P>
With Spain and Pakistan expected to take the first two
qualifying spots from group B, both Malaysia and Argentina are
evenly placed with four points each to fight for the third place.
</P>
<P>
The third and fourth teams from each group will play off
against each other to determine the fifth and six qualifying
places for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
On the same day former Asian champions South Korea came closer
to the Olympics with a 4-1 rout of Britain, which was their third
win in a row.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which topped Group A with nine points from three
games, needs only a point to make the trip to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The 12-nation event here sends six qualifiers to the Olympics,

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China will support the production
of domestically made aircraft for civil use and speed up feeder
line expansion, said Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo today.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in the aviation industry should improve the quality
of aircraft, provide better after-sale services, and try every
possible means to satisfy the various needs of their customers, Wu
said at a new aircraft demonstration ceremony held here today.
</P>
<P>
One new aircraft, called "Xinzhou 60," has a range of 1,600 km
and speeds up to 504 km per hour. The principal functions of this
60-seat aircraft approaches the advanced level of similar model in
other countries, but its price is one-third less than foreign
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Feeder line transport has great potential in central and
western China, and can help develop tourism and boost economic
development in the region, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
China now has fewer than 100 feeder line passenger aircraft,
which have a low utilization rate. In the wake of accelerated
economic development in western China, the number these aircraft
will be increased to 400 during the next 20 years.

<HEADLINE> China Displays New Prop Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's new domestically made MA60
airplane flew two consecutive flights here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The propeller-driven plane, with a panda painted on the
fuselage, is 24 meters long and eight meters high, and has 60
seats.
</P>
<P>
Insiders note that the birth of the MA60 marks China's coming
of age in its ability to manufacture advanced modern civilian
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation under the China
Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC I), the MA60s manufacturer,
first tested the plane in 1993, according to Liu Gaozhuo,
president of AVIC I.
</P>
<P>
Numerous tests followed, showing that the MA60s safety
performance and efficiency had both reached world standards, said
Liu.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the MA60 acquired the navigability certificate from
the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and a year later, two
MA60s were put into operation by Chang'an Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Based on projections, China's market demand for these planes
in the next two decades is expected to be more than 400, so the
MA60 may have good prospects here, as well as on the markets of
southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, noted Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu also revealed that six domestic airlines including Sichuan
Airlines, Northern Airlines, and Zhongyuan Airlines have ordered a
total of 26 MA60s.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Improved Family Planning, Resources Management, Environmental Protection (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In developing China's vast western region, it is also necessary
to handle well the relationship between economic development and
population control, and abide by the principle of the rational use
of resources, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that in the new century, the country
must strengthen rather than lessen its work in the areas of
population, and resources and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Party committees and governments at all levels must vigorously
strengthen and further improve leadership for this work and strive
to achieve new progress.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to implement practical measures and policies
concerning population, resources and the environment when
governments at all levels create blueprints for the next five-year
plan, and long-term development targets, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called on Party and government leading officials at
all levels to implement ideas for sustainable development in their
decision-makings, deal properly with the relationship between near-
term and long-term development for both local and national
interests, and base economic and social development on sound
cycles of population, and resources and the environment.
</P>
<P>
It is also imperative to further improve laws and regulations
concerning population, resources, and environment, the president
said, adding that law-breakers should be punished according to law.
</P>
<P>
Following Jiang's address, Premier Zhu Rongji delivered a
mobilization speech, urging governments at all levels to do a
better job in family planning, and resources management and
environmental protection.

"Our success or failure will have a direct bearing on the
country's economic and social security, the quality of the lives
of the Chinese people, and the long-term development of the
Chinese nation," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Party committees and governments at all levels, as well as
family planning and other departments, should fully realize the
importance and formidability of the task, and make sustained
efforts for the realization of the nation's cross-century
development goals, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
In the new century, it is imperative that we earnestly carry
out the Party and central government's decision on enhanced family
planning and the stabilization of a low birth rate, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Better coordinated efforts are needed, along with improved
family planning management mechanisms suitable to the socialist
market economy, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On environmental protection, the president stressed that
continued efforts should be devoted to both pollution prevention
and control, and ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
The overall discharge of pollutants should be further curtailed,
and environmental protection in key polluted cities, river valleys,
regions and sea areas should be further strengthened, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
As to resources management, Jiang noted that the country should
implement the strictest rules and regulations, and continue to
uphold the principle of "developing while protecting; protecting
while developing."
</P>
<P>
He called on the nation to put more efforts into energy
utilization efficiency, and to embark on a new path of economic
growth.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
called here today for major improvements in the country's family
planning, resources management, and environmental protection in
the new century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also said general secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, made the call at a work conference
on population control, natural resources, and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
"It is of major significance for the realization of our cross-
century development goals to further improve family planning,
resources management, and environmental protection," the Chinese
leader said.
</P>
<P>
Other top Chinese leaders including Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li
Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing, and Li Lanqing attended the
meeting at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Jiang noted that the country will strive to
bring the population under 1.4 billion by the year 2010, halt the
deterioration of the environment and noticeably improve it, and
enhance resources management.
</P>
<P>
"This represents an arduous and important task for the whole
Party and the whole nation," the president said.
</P>
<P>
As the world's most populous developing nation, China is quite
limited in its per capita natural resources. "We must always see
population control, the preservation of resources, and
environmental protection from a strategic point of view," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
In the 21st century, China must continue to put great efforts
into stabilizing the low birth rate, maintaining the rational use
and strict management of resources, and protecting and improving
the ecological environment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Quality Education Stressed in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Quality education, which is being
stepped up in the Tibet Autonomous Region, is expected to give
rise to a new generation of well-educated and specialized farmers
and herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Cering, a deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
and commissiner of Tibet's Shannan Prefecture, who is here
attending the ongoing Third Session of the Ninth NPC, said
Tibetans in his prefecture are working very hard this year to
spread the practice of quality education to all its 12 counties.
</P>
<P>
"In economically backward areas, examination-oriented education
should be replaced by quality education, and students be taught to
learn useful techniques as well as rudimentary intellectual
knowledge," he said. Some 20 percent of local fiscal income in the
prefecture would allocated for education this year.
</P>
<P>
In Gonggar County, which took the lead in popularizing quality
education, second graders of the junior middle schools would begin
learning to do sowing, do farming, repair farm tools and
implements, breed domestic animals or poultry in a scientific way,
or draw traditional Tangka paintings, in addition to attending
general cultural courses.
</P>
<P>
Dorje Cering, commissioner of Qamdo Prefecture, said students
in his prefecture have already benefited from the training in
specialized education, particularly from special skills in
specialties of Tibetan pharmacy, veterinary medicine and
greenhouse nursing and planting.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, an NPC deputy and chairman of the Autonomous Regional
People's Congress Standing Committee, said that development of
science and technology and education are the fundamental guarantee
for Tibet's involvement in the strategy of large-scale development
in western China. Education provides Tibetan economy with a
powerful backing, he said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Perform Strengthened Function of Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Supervision by deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) over the government and law
enforcement departments has developed to a new level and become
one of their top priorities of daily work.
</P>
<P>
"I had almost no sense of exercising the right of supervision
18 years ago when I first came to Beijing as an NPC deputy
attending the annual session; instead I had only two things in
mind: participating in meetings attentively and retelling what I
have learned here about the central government's policies to
people back home," said Zeng Xiaozhen, an NPC deputy and vice
chairman of the Standing Committee of the Jilin Provincial
People's Congress. But nowadays, he says he handles many
suggestions and advice for, and criticisms of, the government and
law enforcement departments annually.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Chen Miaozhen is another example. Only in recent years
has the female deputy of 18 years felt her authority. In 1998, she
complained at the annual NPC session that some local government
officials purposefully set obstacles for NPC deputies when the
latter exercise functions as representatives of the people. As a
result, officials concerned were punished. "Now, we have a
stronger voice," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to local people's congresses have also strengthened
their supervisory role. Last year in Guangdong province, more than
20 deputies to the provincial legislature twice made inquires into
environmental protection work in the province and twice refused to
pass replies submitted to the congress by the provincial
environmental protection agency. Also last year, thanks to a
complaint from deputies to the Hunan provincial people's congress,
some officials of the provincial immigration bureau were
prosecuted for embezzlement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee is working on some regulations to
tighten supervision over judicial and procuratorial organs in an
attempt to rectify possible law violations in the process of law
enforcement, sources said.

from the government for non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>

tape is not adequate to boost non-oil exports, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.

<P>
Meanwhile, head of the Carpet Exporters Guilds Kaykhosro Sobhe
said that the volume of rugs and handicraft exports exceeded 703
million U.S. dollars in the first 11 months of the current Iranian
calendar year which ends on March 20.

country's total non-oil exports and registered a 26.5 percent
growth compared to the same period last Iranian year.

<P>
The bank's net profits fell to 17.6 million dinars (24.6 million

Zuhair Khouri.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Bank, the largest in Jordan's 21 major banks in
terms of capital, was founded in 1974 and owned by Jordanian and

</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on Saturday
underlined the need for modernizing the country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during an inspection tour to the central Yazd province,
Khatami said the government is determined to change traditional
agricultural methods to mechanized farming and to make optimum use
of available facilities.
</P>
<P>
Noting that continued use of traditional methods in the
agriculture sector would be harmful for the country, Khatami called
for necessary steps to transform and modernize agricultural
methods, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined that the ground should be prepared for the
revival and expansion of processing and packaging industries and
export of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's National Petrochemical Company is holding talks
with foreign companies to attract about 2 billion dollars in
foreign capital, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iran aims to increase its share in the total volume of
petrochemical products worldwide from the current 0.5 percent to 2
percent by the end of 2005, according to Deputy Oil Minister for
Petrochemical Affairs Mohammad-Reza Nematzadeh.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 billion dollars is needed to meet this goal, he said,
adding that the value of Iran's petrochemical exports would exceed
2 billion dollars by 2005.
</P>
<P>
He noted that future investments in Iran's petrochemical
industry would be mainly in the production of plastics and

<HEADLINE> Political Stability Vital to Economy: Turkish Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Devlet Bahceli has stressed the importance of political stability
for the development of economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in eastern
province of Erzurum, Bahceli said that the government will strictly
implement the set economic and social measures and must succeed in
its anti-inflation program, the Anatolia News Agency reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The eastern and southeastern Turkey are underdeveloped due to
chaos caused by the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK),
which has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bahceli said that the 57th government succeeded in providing
political stability. "It is a government of reform which is
determined to resolve long-standing problems of Turkey," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier said that "we will not make any concession
from implementation of economic and social measures. The inflation
will reduce to 25 percent as of the end of 2000, to 12 percent in
2001 and to 7 percent at the end of the anti-inflation program."
</P>
<P>
He called for the Turkish nation to fulfil its responsibilities
and contribute to the program in order to "reach our target."
</P>
<P>
Admitting that there were an unfair income distribution and
imbalance among regions in Turkey, Bahceli said that "we should
overcome imbalance among the regions."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that first of all, Turkey put into practice the
Eastern Anatolia Project to resolve chronic underdevelopment of the
region.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for social peace in Turkey to facilitate
economic development Bahceli said, adding that "no one can reach to
invest in conflict and separatist-plagued regions."
</P>
<P>
The 57th government has achieved a great success in fighting
terrorism. We are determined to achieve the same success also in
social development.
</P>
<P>
The 57th government is striving to prepare a program to solve
problems in Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia, he added.

CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Michael Schumacher drove a
faultless 58 laps in a Ferrari to take the first Grand Prix of the
season Sunday at Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher covered the Albert Park circuit in one hour, 34
minutes and 1.987 seconds to clinch his first Australian GP and
Ferrari's second in succession.

The 31-year-old double world champion from Germany had never
won the Australian race before, with his best previous finish
being a two-time second place, in 1992 and 1997.

<P>
His 36th career victory came after both Mclarens, driven by
Finland's world champion Mika Hakkinen and Briton David Coulthard
were forced to retire in the early stages due to engine problems.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello of Brazil,
looking for his maiden victory, made the most of his first race
for the Italian giants, finishing 11.4 seconds back in second.
</P>
<P>
The Williams-BMW of Ralf Schumacher was third and former world

MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Philvos) Sunday advised residents
along Mayon to be alert and ready to evacuate should there be
prolonged rainfall and large magnitude earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the Phivolcs said during the past
24 hours, eight low-frequency type volcanic earthquakes and seven
episodes of short duration tremors were detected by the seismic
network.
</P>
<P>
The trend for ground deformation is an apparent deflation of
the edifice based on the Electronic Distance Meter (EDM), it said.
</P>
<P>
The Philvocs said that the moderate seismic level, deflation of
the volcanic cone, moderate steam and sulfur dioxide outputs,
including crater glow, indicate the volcano's gradual return to
quiet conditions.
</P>
<P>
But Alex Baluloy of Phivolcs said, at this stage, these
parameters are still above normal levels and big rains could cause
mudflows.
</P>
<P>
"It is, therefore, necessary to keep the six kilometers
extended permanent danger zone in the southeast quadrant free from
permanent human activity in case resurgence should occur," the
volcanologist said.
</P>
<P>
Mayon, the most active volcano in the Southeastern Philippines,
erupted on February 24, forcing 60,000 residents to flee their
homes. Since then, the volcano exploded several times, but no
casualties were reported.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Consumer Price Index Up 0.4 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's general consumer
price index rose by 0.4 percent in 1999 after registering a
decline of 0.3 percent in 1998, according to data released Sunday
by the Singapore Department of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The data showed changes in the consumer price index for
households in different income groups.
</P>
<P>
Households in the lowest 20 percent income group experienced a
inflation of 1.2 percent in 1999, lower than the 1.4 percent in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for the middle 60 percent income group was
half a percent in 1999, the same rate as in 1998.
</P>
<P>
As a result of higher car prices, the consumer price index for
households in the top 20 percent income group went up by 0.6
percent in 1999, in striking contrast with the 4.3 percent decline
in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The data also shows that the consumer price index for general
households increased by 1.1 percent in the second half of 1999,
compared with 0.3 percent decline in the first half of the year,
and all of the three income groups had the similar rising trend.

TOKYO, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Asian Games champion Naoko
Takahashi took a clean win in the Nagoya International Women's
Marathon on Sunday and earned herself an almost certain spot in
the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Takahashi, running in her first marathon since she won the
event at the Bangkok Asian Games in December 1998, was the class
of the field as she completed the course in a brisk two hours 22
minutes 19 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old surged ahead from the pack after 22 kilometers
and beat her nearest competitor by more than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese marathon ace set the national record at the Asian
Games in the Bangkok heat but has been plagued by a series of
injuries after that which kept her out of the last year's world
championships in Seville, Spain.

<HEADLINE> Prominent Iranian Reformist in Critical Condition After Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- An advisor of Iranian moderate
President Mohammad Khatami was shot in an apparent assassination
attempt Sunday morning and is still in critical condition in a
Tehran hospital.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Hajjarian, a member of the Tehran Municipal Council and
head of the reformist Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning) daily, was shot
by two unidentified gunmen outside the city hall at about 08:35 a.
m. (0505 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, another council member who saw the
shooting said that two men aboard a motorcycle stopped briefly in
front of the council building and fired at Hajjarian.
</P>
<P>
"The assailant targeted Hajjarian's temple, but since his hand
trembled the bullet hit Hajjarian's face," Tabatabaei said.
</P>
<P>
The assailants fled the scene immediately, but some persons have
seen their faces, which would be helpful in identifying the
attackers, the Islamic Republic News Agency IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
So far no individuals or group have claimed responsibility for
attack.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the hospital are sparing no efforts to save
Hajjarian's life, with one bullet going from his left cheek to the
back of his neck, IRNA Dr. Mohammad Reza Zafarqandi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said Hajjarian, who is in coma, needs more time for
observation before a statement can be released on his condition.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the city council official, who had respiratory
problems when arriving at the hospital, is now breathing better
with the help of a respirator.
</P>
<P>
The base of Hajjarian's brain is currently swollen as the
bullet's trajectory was close to the brain, he disclosed, adding
that no surgery has yet to be performed and the medical team
believe that there is no need for a surgical operation so far.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, the former deputy intelligence minister, is a central
council member of the reformist Islamic Iran Participation Front
(IIPF) led by Mohammad Reza Khatami, the younger brother of
President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The IIPF and its reformist allies won an overwhelming victory in
the February 18 parliamentary elections, gaining control of Majlis
(parliament) from conservatives, who pushed strict theocratic rule
in Iran and opposed Khatami's reform drive.
</P>
<P>
Before the sensitive polling that was widely seen as a chance to
break conservatives tight seizure over the country's major
government organs, Hajjarian called for a "house-clearing" in the
country, an ancient tradition before the Iranian new year on March
21, in order to facilitate reform programs of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the incident, Head of Iranian Presidential Office
Mohammad Ali Abtahi and some parliamentarians rushed to hospital to
follow up the issue.
</P>
<P>
Sources of the Sobh-e Emrouz newspaper said that their offices
in Urumieh, West Azarbaijan province were attacked on Friday by a
group of people. They broke windows, poured petrol in the houses
and set fire to them.
</P>
<P>
The daily has published a series of reports on the political
killings of Iranian opposition leaders and dissident writers at the
end of 1998, in which some agents of the Intelligence Ministry,
including a former deputy minister, were involved.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme National Security Council reportedly held an
emergency meeting hot on the heels of the incident and a special
team is to be formed to investigate issue.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which is
responsible to supervise the country's mass media, strongly
condemned the assassination attempt against Hajjarian.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, the ministry said that Hajjarian was the
target of those who oppose freedom and stressed that the
development
of democracy in Iran could never be stopped by shooting.

<HEADLINE> Israel's General Staff to Submit Unilateral Withdrawal Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The General Staff of Israel
Defense Force (IDF) is scheduled to submit on Sunday its plan for
the pullout from south Lebanon to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, local
daily Ha'aretz said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, dubbed Morning Twilight and prepared by
the General Staff's Operations Branch, General Staff officers
warned that in the absence of an agreement with Syria, the Israeli
army would have to continue air and land actions in Lebanon even
after a unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the plan said that even after the withdrawal, the IDf
would continue to maintain bases several hundred meters into south
Lebanon, partly to save millions of shekels that would be required
to move them to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The plan also differs in key respects from the New Horizon plan,
prepared by the IDF earlier for a withdrawal that is carried out
after Israel seals an agreement with Syria, the power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Morning Twilight plan calls for greater fortification of
Jewish settlement in northern Israel and preparation for continued
fighting in the north.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Barak met with the General Staff officers to justify
his order to the IDF to prepare for a unilateral pullout by July 1,
with or without an agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place after top IDF officers, including IDF
Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz and Northern Commander Major
General Gabi Ashkenazi, expressed in recent weeks reservations
about a unilateral pullout.
</P>
<P>
Some IDF officers implied that while they will follow government
orders, they would refuse moral responsibility for any catastrophe
such a pullout might trigger.
</P>
<P>
General Staff critics of a unilateral pullout from south Lebanon
also told Barak that such a move would undermine regional
stability, increase the chance of a violent escalation and hamper
all efforts to defend northern Israeli settlements,
</P>
<P>
It would also represent a betrayal to the South Lebanese Army
(SLA), the pro-Israeli Lebanese militia group which is helping
Israel patrolling the so-called security zone Israel carved out in
south Lebanon in 1985 claimedly to protect its north, they said.
</P>
<P>
Some other General Staff officers expressed their support to
Barak's decision, saying that after the initial period of
instability following the pullout, the northern border would quiet
down and the threat there would subside.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Negotiators Meets on Interim Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators held their first meeting in over a month in Jerusalem
late Saturday night to discuss the outstanding interim issues.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian
counterpart Saeb Erekat discussed the long-overdue 6.1 percent
withdrawal by Israeli troops from the West Bank, the Jerusalem Post
quoted senior Israeli officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Friday urged Israelis to
carry out the delayed redeployment in the coming days, which should
have taken place in mid-January according to the Sharm el Sheikh
Memorandum the two sides signed last September, but had been
postponed due to their difference over withdrawal maps.
</P>
<P>
Eran and Erekat discussed the release of another batch of
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, which is expected to happen
before the four-day Muslim festival Eid al-Adha, or Feast of
Sacrifice, beginning on March 16.
</P>
<P>
They also tried to resolve their difference over the
inauguration of a northern safe passage route, which connects the
Palestinian self-rule Gaza to its autonomous areas in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the meeting, according to the reports, is to iron
out the remaining differences between the two sides and carry out
all the interim steps in the coming two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators did not focus on the framework agreement for
final-status talks, because they are to travel to Washington next
week for these topics.
</P>
<P>
The permanent-status negotiation between Israelis and
Palestinians deals with thorny issues such as the status of
Jerusalem, borders, the future of Jewish settlements on occupied
land and the return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum, they should reach a
framework agreement on final-status issues by February 13 and a
final accord on permanent peace by September 13.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks have fallen into a crisis after breakdown of
a summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat at
Erez checkpoint at Gaza-Israeli border, which had made the two
sides miss the February 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders could not resolve their differences over the 6.1
percent withdrawal of West Bank land, the size and timing of the
final withdrawal, and the question of whether a framework agreement
can be skipped.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock, Barak, Arafat and United States Mideast
envoy Dennis Ross held a three-way meeting in the West Bank city of
Ramallah last Wednesday, after which they announced the resumption
of peace talks later this month in the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
The success was attributed to a "confidence-building" compromise
package presented by Barak, which reportedly includes release of
Palestinian prisoners and the opening of the northern "safe
passage."

<HEADLINE> Arrow Missile Can Not Withstand Iran's Shehab 3: Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALRM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Arrow anti-missile system
Israel is producing can not protect against Iran's advanced Shehab-
3 ballistic missiles, Israel's high-level officials of the defense
establishment have said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has long been suspected by the U.S. and Israel of buying
long-range missile technology from North Korea and Russia for the
1,300-kilometer Shehab-3 missile it tested in July 1998. The
missile is capable of hitting Israel, Saudi Arbia and U.S. forces
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources have said the missile, with a payload of 700
kilograms, is based on North Korea's No-Dung missile, but Russia
took over from Pyongyang in 1994 after failures in the program's
development. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli intelligence and military sources had said their main
fear is that any Iranian missile, regardless of its accuracy, would
embolden Tehran's allies, such as Syria or Islamic fundamentalist
groups, to launch an offensive against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The directorate of Homa, a Defense Ministry organ responsible
for developing the Arrow, also said during discussions on the anti-
missile system that the Arrow missile currently in production can
provide a response against the Scud-derived ballistic missiles in
the arsenals of Iran, Iraq and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Homa also reiterated the assessment of engineers from Israel
Aircraft Industries, the project's prime contractor, that when more
advanced models of the Iranian ballistic missiles become
operational, the Arrow can be improved to provide sufficient
response, Israeli Ha'aretz daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israel Air Force Chief Eitan Ben-Eliyahu will hold a
ceremony declaring the Arrow operational, giving Israel the
capacity to defend itself against ballistic missile attacks. Israel
will be the first country in the world with such a capability.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow system, a U.S. -Israel joint project producing
missiles, launchers, radar and the control and command system, cost
1.3 billion U.S. dollars to develop. By 2010, the total investment
in the project will reach 2.2 billion U.S. dollars.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Arab League wrapped up its biannual foreign ministers'
meeting in Beirut Saturday by calling for a re-evaluation of
relations with Israel in light of recent Israel Air Force attacks
on Lebanese infrastructure targets.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, participants voiced opposition to a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon and warned that
such a move would lead to war.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy scoffed at the statement,
saying the anti-Israel decisions proved that the extreme line still
reigns supreme at the Arab bloc.
</P>
<P>
An official at Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office called the
Arab's opposition to the Israeli redeployment from Lebanon "absurd"
and said it proves to the world how difficult it is to work with "
illogical partners who cry about the Israeli presence in Lebanon
day and night, and then criticize our decision to leave."
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli General Staff officers will present Barak with the
Israel Defense Forces' plan for a pullout from south Lebanon on
Sunday, warning that in the absence of an agreement with Syria, the
army would have to continue air and land actions in Lebanon even
after a unilateral withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, dubbed Morning Twilight, the Israeli
troops would continue to maintain bases several hundred meters into
Lebanon after the withdrawal, partly to save the millions of
shekels for their redeployment in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for greater fortification of settlements in
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Workers at most local authorities in Israel are on a 24-hour
strike Sunday in accordance with the decision of the federation of
office, administration and service workers. The Tel Aviv, Jerusalem
and Haifa municipalities, though, will operate normally.
</P>
<P>
The strike will not affect special education, private
transportation drivers and emergency centers. Fire-fighting
services will be limited.
</P>
<P>
The strike is protesting the government's violation of
agreements on levels of support to local welfare bureaus. The
organizers have threatened a longer strike if the problem isn't
resolved by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is to be questioned
this week on allegations that he sexually assaulted a 23-year-old
female employee at his ministry. Police hope to wind up the
investigation within a week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Last week police questioned the woman who filed a complaint with
the police on three different occasions, and also re-enacted the
events that allegedly took place in Mordechai's Tel Aviv office.
</P>
<P>
The special team investigating the matter is currently only
focusing on the woman's complaint, despite the fact that other
women had reported similar incidents between them and Mordechai,
some of which occurred 20 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Local Authority Employees on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Employees at most local
authorities throughout Israel are on a 24-hour work stoppage Sunday
to protest against the government's budget policies which failed to
increase funds for local authorities.
</P>
<P>
At the authorities involved in the strike, there are no services
Sunday to the public, either in person or by telephone.
Engineering, tax collection and municipal inspection services are
not available as well.
</P>
<P>
Kindergarten assistants and school administrators have also
suspended their work, and there are only limited services in trash
collection and fire-fighting.
</P>
<P>
The social services departments of all local authorities have
been on strike since last Thursday to protest against the
government's reducing funds to the debt-ridden local social
services system.
</P>
<P>
But the Sunday strike did not affect Jerusalem, where the
upcoming visit of Pope John Paul II was cited as a reason for
maintaining services and thereby reducing tension in the city.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Knesset (parliament) Finance Committee Elie
Goldschmidt decided to hold an emergency meeting on Monday to be
attended by heads of local authority on the budget issue.
</P>
<P>
Neir Nitzan, chairman of the Local Authorities Union's General
Assembly and mayor of Rishon Letzion, said that the Labor and
Social Affairs Ministry budget for 2000 grew by 7 percent over last
year, but the increase has not been turned into more funds for the
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Other local authority officials said that social services
departments had up 700 million shekels (175 million U.S. dollars)
in debt.
</P>
<P>
"A million people need the local social service departments,"
Chairman of the Union of Local Authorities Adi Eldar told the
Israel Radio on Sunday, "but our budget for these services has
shrunk."

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Largest Bank Sees Less Net Profits in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Net profits of the Housing Bank of
Jordan, the largest commercial bank of the kingdom, dropped by 28.1
percent or 6.9 million Jordanian dinars (9.66 million U.S. dollars)
in 1999 from the previous year, according to a bank statement
available on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bank's net profits fell to 17.6 million dinars (24.6 million
dollars) in 1999 from 24.5 million dinars (34.3 million dollars) in
1998 despite rising deposits, assets and expanded operations, said
the statement by Chairman of the Board of Directors of the bank
Zuhair Khouri.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, deposits in the Housing Bank rose by 20
percent to 1.2 billion dinars (16.8 billion dollars) from 1 billion
dinars (14 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The total assets of the bank were valued at 1.5 billion dinars
(2.1 billion dollars) at the end of 1999 as against 1.4 billion
dinars (1.96 billion dollars) in 1998, or a 9.3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Bank, the largest in Jordan's 21 major banks in
terms of capital, was founded in 1974 and owned by Jordanian and
Islamic investors, mainly from Kuwait, Libya as well as Iran.
</P>
<P>
Some 15 percent of the net profits in 1999 will be distributed
among the shareholders of the bank, Khouri said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank had raised its capital to 100 million dinars (140
million dollars) in 1999 to expand and improve its operation and
services, including the installation of 100 automatic teller
machines across the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also planning to buy another local bank, the Union
Bank for Savings and Investment, this year, and talks for the
purchase are expected to be concluded by the first week of April,
bank sources said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Clears 26,000 Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has unearthed 26,000
landmines in Victoria Falls, a renowned tourist attraction, and in
the northern Zambezi Valley since the clearing program started 18
months ago, The Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Army Engineers Commander Tom Munongwa told the
newspaper that the program was "moving on well". The army had
reclaimed a tract of land 20 kilometers long in Victoria Falls
and it was now free and open to tourism.
</P>
<P>
A private company, Koch Mine Safe, which won the tender to
remove landmines in the Zambezi Valley of north Zimbabwe had so
far cleared 335 square kilometers of land for resettlement, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The army suspects that there were about two million landmines
along Zimbabwe's borders with Mozambique and South Africa. The
landmines were placed by the former Rhodesian forces between 1976
and 1979 to block liberation war guerillas from crossing into the
country.
</P>
<P>
The landmines, in six major landmine fields, had caused untold
suffering to Zimbabweans living near the border with hundreds
having been killed since independence in 1980 and many more
maimed. Thousands of both domestic and wild animals were also
killed.
</P>
<P>
Munongwa said the clearing program was tediously slow because
the process of removing landmines was a manual one. It was likely
that the clearing process would take another 10 years before its
completion. The total length of land under landmines was more
than 700 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Fails to Meet Beef Export Quota to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is failing to meet its
beef export quota to the European Union (EU) because of the
shortage of slaughter stock and the operational problems being
faced by the country's biggest exporter, the Cold Storage Company
(CSC), The Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a report from the Ministry of Lands and
Agriculture as saying that for the fourth year in a row, Zimbabwe
had last year failed to meet the 9,100 tons annual quota it was
supposed to supply to the EU under the Lome IV Convention. This
had cost the country millions of dollars in potential revenue.
</P>
<P>
A 35-percent reduction in the national herd in the past 10
years had greatly reduced the slaughter stock especially in the
export approved zones.
</P>
<P>
"The 1991/92 historic drought, which saw the national beef herd
 declining from seven million to 4.5 million head of cattle
resulted in the shortage of slaughter stock," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the ministry was working out a rescue package,
including a possible debt take-over, to bring the CSC back to
viability.

<HEADLINE> Drought Kills 20 in Northeastern Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 20 people have reportedly
died of hunger in drought-hit Wajir District, Kenya's North
Eastern Province, over the last two weeks, local media said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds face starvations as the devastating drought, which has
killed thousands of animals in the last three months, still
rages.
</P>
<P>
Local pastoralists told the journalists who were on a
fact-finding tour of the drought-stricken areas that they had lost
10,000 cattle, 20,000 goats and 25,000 camels in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Aden Kenyan, Wajir West Parliament member, appealed to the
government and donor agencies to urgently respond to the famine
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The government has been supplying a paltry 4,000 bags (90 kg
per bag) of maize monthly to the district which has a population
of 300,000.
</P>
<P>
As severe drought hits the most parts of Kenya, especially in
northwestern and northeastern regions, for a fairly long period,
more than two million Kenyans are facing a threat of famine.
</P>
<P>
In early February this year, the U.N. World Food Program
appealed to donors for 43.4 million U.S. dollars for over two
million Kenyans who need food aid after the dire effects of
drought.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Currency Weakens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's currency shilling
weakened against all major foreign currencies in February, trading
on an average of 70.7 shillings against the U.S. dollar in January
to 73.2 shillings last month, the Central Bank of Kenya has said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly economic review, the bank said that the
shilling lost by 3.5 percent to the dollar while against the
British pound it lost by 1.2 percent, the People daily reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Against the euro, the shilling weakened by a slight margin of
1.0 percent to trade at 72.0 shillings last month compared with
71.8 shillings in January, the review said, adding that the
shilling remained stable against the Japanese yen at the rate of
67 shillings per 100 yen in February.
</P>
<P>
On the local scene, the review indicated that the shilling
weakened against the Uganda shilling by 2.3 percent and the
Tanzanian shilling by 3. 5 percent to exchange at 20.8 Uganda
shillings and 10.9 Tanzania shillings respectively in February.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the weakening of the shilling exchange rate
in February to the substantial decline in interest rates and the
general strengthening of the dollar.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China's vision of a modernized
western territory has caught the attention of not only overseas
businessmen but also China's eastern economically-developed
provinces including the private business owners and workers in
Zhejiang Province in this part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Since early February this year, tens of thousands of small
businessmen and laborers have poured into the western provinces
and autonomous regions. Meanwhile, farmers from the mountainous
areas of Lishui Prefecture in Zhejiang are also heading west,
armed with techniques for planting mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
In fact, many of Zhejiang's self-employed business people and
workers already have established roots in western China.
Statistics show that among the 3 million Zhejiang people who are
working outside the province, 80,000 are in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, 120,000 are in Shaanxi, and some 200,000 are in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Some small commodities markets the province has set up in
western provinces and regions of the country serve as a roadway
for private business people and workers to enter the western
markets.
</P>
<P>
The "Zhejiang Commodities Town" in Dongxing City, southwest
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has 500 proprietors who
sell over one billion yuan-worth (some 120 million U.S. dollars)
of textiles annually.

<HEADLINE> Eco-Environment Ground Station Completed at Three Gorges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A ground station to monitor
flooding, drought and the ecological environment in the Three
Gorges reservoir area has been completed in Badong County of
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
As construction continues on the world's largest hydro-electric
power project at the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River, people's concern is mounting over the negative
impact that the work may have on the ecology in the river,
especially in the gorge area.
</P>
<P>
The project, with an estimated price tag of 203.9 billion yuan,
includes the building of a 1,983-meter long and 185-meter high dam
and installation of 26 generating units with a combined generating
capacity of 18.2 million kw and an annual output of 84.7 billion
kwh. Added to that, 1.2 million local residents are to be
relocated from their homes in the gorge area.
</P>
<P>
Situated among the Three Gorges and the upstream the Three
Gorges Dam, Badong County has the most complex terrain along the
Yangtze and endures regular mudslides and landslides.
</P>
<P>
The new station, financed by the Yangtze River Water
Conservation Committee, is meant to help speed up the work of
construction and relocation of people inside the Three Gorges
reservoir area, improving the environment in the area, and
preventing natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with advanced technologies including aero-remote
sensing and telemetry, the station can provide scientific data and
experimental results to programs such as surveys on the eco-
environment in the reservoir area, land planning, topographical
surveys for major construction projects, as well as post-disaster
evaluation.

<HEADLINE> Natural Energy Resources Benefit Inner Mongolians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Young Wendu Rina knows it's hard
to pay attention to your teacher when you're shivering in an
unheated classroom.
</P>
<P>
Several weeks each year, Wendu's primary school, like the
others in Hexigten Banner in the northernmost part of north China'
s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, had to close on account of the
bitter cold. The annual average temperature for the area hovers
around 2.5 degrees Celsius and drops as low as minus 30 in winter.
</P>
<P>
But the region's plentiful solar energy, supplying a good 300
days of sunshine a year, has put kids back at their desks. Since
1998 the local government has warmed up the schools with 15,000 sq.
m. of solar power.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, natural energy resources in nearby Ujimgin Banner,
in northeastern Xilin Gol Grasslands, have improved the quality of
life for many local residents who for years had to depend on 50-
watt wind-driven electric generators. The sparse population and
poor road conditions in the banner made it difficult to set up an
area-wide power grid.
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Har Bara bought a color TV and hurried back home
in the banner, anxious to begin channel surfing. But the electric
voltage in his house was too low to light up the screen.
</P>
<P>
This year the local government turned to wind power, setting up
2,800 wind-driven generators and 200 solar batteries, benefiting
50 percent of the residents there, including Har, who now can
watch his TV.
</P>
<P>
According to local meteorological departments, the wind energy
capacity in the region is about 1.01 billion kw, ranking the first
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the autonomous regional government said that
five large wind-power plants have been set up in Inner Mongolia.
The largest has a generating capacity of up to 1.2 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Use of natural energy is not only cost-effective, but also
environmentally-friendly. The green grasslands and the blue sky
remain the lures for hundreds of thousands of tourists, said the
officials.

<P>
YANTAI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- China recently deported a man from
the Republic of Korea (ROK) who was charged smuggling and selling
ROK-made leather.
</P>
<P>
According to judgment of the Intermediate People's Court of
Yantai, a coastal city in east China's Shandong Province, Cho
Shang Kyu was also fined 150,000 yuan (about 18,070 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Cho Shang Kyu smuggled 166,000 square feet of
leather from Tianjin Port to Yantai last August. Cho was seized by
local police while selling the smuggled material.
</P>
<P>
Cho was deported from Yantai on March 1.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Extend Lease of China's Boeing 757 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Nepal Airlines
Corporation (RNAC) has decided to extend the lease period of China
South West Airlines' Boeing 757 currently for three more months,
said by a RNAC press release available here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The press release said the decision was made after none of the
tender bids made for the supply of a Boeing 767 aircraft as
advertised by the corporation met the condition of the airlines.
</P>
<P>
RNAC's lease contract with China South West Airlines for the
current aircraft expires on March 27.
</P>
<P>
The release also said RNAC will make a shift from its stance on
the age of the aircraft and call for bids from aircrafts that are
10 years old instead of the present 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
RNAC only contains three Boeing planes in its fleet -- two are
its own while the other is leased.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- About 5,000 army and Bangladesh
Rifles (BDR) personnel will be deployed to help police maintain
security in Dhaka during U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit on
March 20, the Daily Star reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the streets on which Clinton will travel will
be "out-of-bounds" to other traffic at least half an hour before
he passes. The by-lanes leading to the main roads will also be out-
of bounds during that time.
</P>
<P>
The Special Security Force, which is coordinating the security
arrangements, will start deploying security personnel to the city'
s roads at least 24-hours before Clinton arrives. The force is
usually responsible for the protection of Bangladesh's president
and the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Metropolitan police will also be reinforced by about
200 officials and over 1,000 constables from different districts,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rises to 2.14 percent in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate recorded
a marginal increase of 0.6 percent to 2.14 percent for the week
that ended on February 26, 2000, despite a perceptible decline in
the overall price index.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the 0.6 percentage
point increase in the annual rate of inflation to 2.14 percent
from 2.08 percent in the previous week was in contrast with the
falling trends witnessed in all the major categories of Wholesale
Price Index.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate stood at 5.59 percent in the corresponding
week of last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the upward trend of inflation is likely to gain
momentum in the coming weeks due to the five percent increase in
freight charges and other budgetary measures including raising
excise duty on a number of items of mass consumption to be
effective from April 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Former world No.1 Monica Seles
of the United States began her bid for a second title in three
events with a convincing straight-set triumph today at the $2
million Tennis Masters Series of Indian Wells in California, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Seles, the seventh seed and 1992 champion, needed just over an
hour to dump Silvia Farina of Italy 6-1, 6-2 and advance to the
third round.
</P>
<P>
Tenth seed Barbara Schett of Austria also was not threatened in
her second-round match as she vanquished Kristina Brandi of the
United States 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Amanda Coetzer was not as fortunate, as former top-10
player Dominique Van Roost of Belgium eliminated the diminutive
South African 1-6, 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
In unseeded second-round matchups, Australian teenager Jelena
Dokic rallied past Silvija Talaja of Croatia 5-7, 7-5, 6-1;
Tatiana Panova of Russia defeated Nicole Pratt of Australia 6-4, 6-
4, and lucky loser Meghann Shaugnessy of the United States
struggled past Nathalie Dechy of France 7-5, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
Seles was out of action since last September with a broken foot,
but made a successful season debut at Oklahoma City two weeks ago
by winning her 45th career singles title. She reached the
quarterfinals in her second event last week in Scottsdale, Arizona,
but lost to second-ranked Lindsay Davenport of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Martina Hingis of Switzerland and Davenport are the
top seeds at this hardcourt event, with defending champion Serena
Williams of the United States seeded third. All are in action on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mathalie Tauziat of France is seeded fourth, followed by Mary
Pierce of France, Spain's Conchita Martinez, Seles and Russian
teenager Anna Kournikova, who has reached the semifinals in her
last two events and is searching for her first career singles
title.
</P>
<P>
Julie Halard-Decugis of France is the ninth seed, followed by
Schett and 1999 semifinals Sandrine Testud of France.
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the top 16 seeds are Amelie Mauresmo of France,
Anke Huber of Germany, Coetzer and Elena Likhovtseva of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Venus Williams, Serena's older sister, remains on the sidelines
with tendinitis in both wrists and has not played a match this

WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Fifth seed Tim Henman of
Britain advanced to his second ATP Tour final of the season today
with a 6-3, 6-3 win over seventh seed Albert Costa of Spain at the$
375,000 Franklin Templeton Tennis Classic in Arizona, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The highest seed remaining in the draw, Henman has not dropped
a set in four matches this week and will vie for his fifth career
ATP Tour title on Sunday in his 14th career finals appearance.
</P>
<P>
In another semifinals tonight, 6th-seeded Australian teenager
Lleyton Hewitt beat unseeded Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Henman was a finalist in Rotterdam last month, losing to Cedric
Pioline of France in a third-set tiebreak, and has compiled a 14-5
match record in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Gunning for his third singles title of the season, the 19-year-
old Hewitt advanced to the semifinals on Friday when third seed
Marcelo Rios of Chile retired in the second set of their match
with leg cramps.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt has put together the best start on the ATP Tour this
season with an impressive 19-1 record, including titles in his
homeland at Adelaide and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero, 20, got past countryman Francisco Clavet 6-4, 3-6, 6-3

second final of the season after a runner-up finish last month in

<HEADLINE> Suns Forward Gugliotta to Undergo Season-Ending Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The harrowing season of
Phoenix Suns forward Tom Gugliotta came to an end today.
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta will undergo surgery later this week to repair two
ruptured ligaments in his left knee and will need approximately
eight months to recover.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old power forward suffered the injury during the
fourth quarter of Friday's 99-96 home loss to the Utah Jazz when
teammate Randy Livingston fell on his leg after a layup attempt.
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta, who was sidelined for seven games after suffering a
seizure on the team bus December 17 in Portland, underwent an MRI
today that indicated a rupture in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
"We've had experience with this injuries in this organization,"
Suns team physician Dr. Richard Emerson said. "We look to shoot
for the seven-to-eight-month range for recovery."
</P>
<P>
An eight-year veteran, Gugliotta was averaging 13.7 points and
7.9 rebounds in 54 games for the Suns, who are visiting Dallas
tonight. Phoenix has won 13 of its last 16 games and is fifth in
the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
Gugliotta was in his second season with the Suns, his fourth
NBA team. He had some scary moments after his seizure when he lost
consciousness and stopped breathing, but he made a full recovery
and jumped back into Phoenix's starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
The Long Island, New York native entered this season averaging
16.7 points and 8.8 rebounds. A 1997 All-Star with the Minnesota
Timberwolves, Gugliotta signed as a free agent with Phoenix before
last season.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Probe War Games Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
investigate the reported shelling of a fishing village in the
northern province of Zambales during the recent joint U.S.-
Philippine war games.
</P>
<P>
The Today newspaper Sunday quoted Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado as saying that charges will be filed against those found
responsible for the incident -- be they Filipinos or Americans.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to find out what exactly happened. As to those who
are responsible, we will make them answer for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that during the live-fire exercise in the
coastal area of Zambales on February 26, four shots were fired
toward Tabones Island, an impact area.

But whoever fired at the island overshot the targets and the
shells landed on Talisain Island, located between Tabones Island
and Zambales mainland, the paper said.
</P>

The U.S. and the Philippines held the Balikatan 2000 military

<HEADLINE> Australian Study Shows Link between Diet, Cataracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- An Australian study has provided
the strongest evidence yet that some B vitamins protect against
age-related cataracts, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The study of nearly 3,000 people living in the Blue Mountains
of the southeast New South Wales state showed that a balanced diet
with plenty of protein was important to eye health.
</P>
<P>
The AAP quoted Professor Paul Mitchell, from the University of
Sydney's Department of Ophthalmology, as saying the study showed
that the nucleus of the lens - the part which becomes opaque when
a cataract develops - was sensitive to nutrient deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the American journal Ophthalmology,
showed the B vitamins niacin, thiamin and riboflavin - found
richly in cereals - were important dietary requirements.
</P>
<P>
Protein and antioxidants, including vitamin A, also boosted eye
health, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
"This study provides stronger data than others, suggesting that
these nutrients are associated with reduced risk of cataract,"
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
Those in the top 20 percent of consumers of these important
nutrients had about half the rate of cataracts as those in the
bottom 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
One vegetable was found to be more protective than others, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We found an association between eating spinach and reduced
risk of cataract, but it only just bordered on being statistically
significant," he said.
</P>
<P>
The findings represent the latest analysis of data from the
Blue Mountains Eye Study, which was conducted in 1992-94 among
over-50s residents of the region, west of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The study, co-authored by Dr. Bob Cumming from the Department
of Public Health and Community Medicine of the University of
Sydney, underlined the importance of older people getting the
recommended daily serves of nutritious food.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Rivers Facing New Pollution Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Romania rivers are facing a new
pollution threat, after 20,000 tons of lead, copper, zinc and
cyanide escaped from a mine in northwestern Romania, authorities
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local reports reaching here said that the new pollution
occurred Friday when snow melt and torrential rains caused a dam
at the Borsa mine to break, sending a wave of polluted waters into
the Viseul River, a tributary of the Tisza river.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Minister for Environmental Protection Romica Tomescu
inspected the site immediately after the spill occurred and then
informed his Hungarian and Ukrainian counterparts of the pollution
in waters heading downstream to their countries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hungarian Environment Minister Pal Pepo also
inspected the Tisza River near the Romanian border during the
night. "Hungary is testing the water of the Tisza, our experts are
ready for cooperation with the Romanian side. We welcome the
gesture from the European Union to lend a hand," said the Minister.
</P>
<P>
The latest spill came six weeks after tons of cyanide-laden
waters spilled into a creek from a Romanian gold mine. The
pollution badly damaged the waters of the Tisza and Danube rivers.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Braces for WTO Challenges: Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a major financial, industrial, trade and shipping center,
Shanghai is likely to become the first city in China to encounter
WTO impacts, said Xu who is attending an on-going annual session
of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The mayor said Shanghai has been making all-round preparations
for the WTO entry over the past three years. He expressed his hope
that the city could serve as a pilot for the rest part of the
country in dealing with problems arising from the WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
Traditional sectors including textiles, light industry,
metallurgy and building materials are expected to benefit from the
accession to the WTO with their exports likely to increase or even
become dominant in the world market.
</P>
<P>
However, the mayor confessed, greater international competition
could challenge local industries like telecommunications, computer,
automobile and pharmacy, which have grown as the city's main
revenue sources over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
To cope with a fiercer competition, Shanghai has sent many
young professionals to developed countries for training, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The economic powerhouse is accelerating state enterprises
reform and encouraging them to cooperate with trans-national
companies, according to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shanghai has set up 23,000 foreign-funded firms and
established two economic development zones in Latin America and
Africa, respectively. He disclosed that the city is considering
building an industrial zone in Central Asia.

<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Today's major Beijing-based
newspapers front-paged yesterday's conclusion of the Third Session
of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), with the top advisory body's
chairman Li Ruihuan calling on the people from all walks of life
and from all nationalities of China to realize the grand goal of
invigorating the Chinese nation and achieving the reunification of
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The country's leading newspaper published an editorial today,
calling the just-ended Third Session of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) a meeting featuring democracy, truth-seeking,
and unity, and a meeting rousing enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC session upheld the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and implemented the guidelines of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Fourth Plenary
Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee as well as principles
expounded by Chinese leader Jiang Zemin in a speech he made
marking the 50th founding anniversary of the CPPCC, the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
-- The presidium of the ongoing Third Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) held its second meeting yesterday,
which was presided over by Li Peng, an executive member of the
presidium.
</P>
<P>
Passed at the meeting were the draft decisions on a government
work report, on the implementation of the 1999 plan for national
economic and social development and the 2000 plan for national
economic and social development, implementation of the 1999
budgets, and budget for the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), urged the Chongqing Municipality
in southwest China to make efficient use of relocation funds and
attach great importance to the resettlement efforts of residents
in the reservoir area of the Three Gorges Project, the biggest
water control project in China.
</P>
<P>
Li made the call at a panel discussion of the Ninth NPC
deputies from Chongqing. While acknowledging the progress
Chongqing has achieved since it became a municipality directly
under the central government in 1997, Li said Chongqing still
faces difficulties in the re-employment of laid-off workers,
poverty elimination, and the relocation of residents for the Three
Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
 China Daily
</P>
<P>
-- Laws and regulations concerning foreign trade and investment
are getting a hard look by some deputies to the ongoing Third
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress now meeting in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers expect to make the laws conform to international
practice and the country's needs as China prepares to enter the
World Trade Organization (WTO). The entry is expected to alter the
country's social and economic landscape.
</P>
<P>
-- How to accelerate economic and social development has been
the hottest topic at the ongoing Third Session of the 9th NPC as
it was at the 3rd Session of the 9th National Committee of the
CPPCC, which closed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the NPC deputies and CPPCC members agree that the
central government should do more to help western and central
parts of China achieve a sounder environment for promoting its
economic and social development.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Industry Should Be Open to Private Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Wei Wenlin, a National People's
Congress deputy, proposed opening China's telecom market to
domestic privately-owned enterprises before the sector is opened
to overseas investors after it joins the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Wei's proposal was supported by many deputies, including Li
Yining, a famous economist from Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
Wei, a senior professor of technology at Qinghua University,
said that the government should give the private enterprises equal
rights to compete with State-owned Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the telecom sector's income was 243.
3 billion yuan (about 29.38 billion U.S. dollars), contributing 3
percent to the national gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
While, the most profitable aspect of the telecom sector, the
Internet Service Provider (ISP) has been still under the control
of State firms including China Telecom and China Unicom.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sino-US agreement on China's WTO entry last
year, China will allow 49 percent overseas investment in all
services, and 50 percent foreign ownership for value-added
services in two years and paging services in three years.
</P>
<P>
With the development of private firms in the ISP and paging
businesses, telecom powers are eyeing the big profit margins
available in mobile phone, fixed line and Internet content
providing fields.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that it would be a good rehearsal to allow domestic
private firms to enter the field first. While strict regulations
are needed to avoid shoddy services and economically suicidal
price wars.
</P>
<P>
Plus, more rivals will hasten structural and management reforms
of the State firms while generating more business opportunities
for the whole industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The central government's move to
direct more investment into China's western area is stirring some
banks' investment enthusiasm among banks, today's "China Daily" (
Business Weekly) reported.
</P>
<P>
The China Development Bank (CDB), the country's biggest policy
bank, is leading the effort, according to the English-language
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The bank is considering issuing long term "Western Development
Bonds" this year, a top bank official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the bonds would be targeted to
commercial banks, institutions as well as individual investors.
They will also be available for listing on stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"The bonds will shore up long term bank loans and alleviate the
funds shortage in western areas," said CDB Governor Chen Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The central government has reiterated the urgency of granting
more support to the development of the western hinterlands this
year.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Peiyan, the State Development Planning Commission
minister, last week said investment for the western region is
projected to rise by 60 percent from last year's 2.99 trillion
yuan (about 361 billion US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Steel Gets Support for Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government is
expected to invest heavily in upgrading its steel sector's
technologies, according to today's "China Daily" (Business Weekly).
</P>
<P>
More than 50 billion yuan (about 6.02 billion US dollars) is
expected to be spent within the next few years to ensure that the
steel industry can compete in world markets after China enters the
World Trade Organization (WTO), said sources with the State
Administration of Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 28 billion yuan of the spending will be in the form of
low-interest bank loans.
</P>
<P>
The steel sector has been selected as a key industry with
access to the use of State treasury bonds for technical upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The decision is in line with Premier Zhu Rongji's government
work report to the Ninth National People's Congress during which
he said the government will speed up technical upgrading of State-
owned enterprises this year.
</P>
<P>
After the WTO accession, China will slash tariffs on steel
products from ten percent to eight percent and remove other
barriers concerning steel product imports by 2005, which is
expected to result in great competitive pressure on domestic steel
producers, especially in area of high-grade steel products.

<HEADLINE> Starving Swans Saved by Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 12 (Xinhua) -- A flock of rare white swans have
been saved from starvation by Chinese soldiers in northwest China'
s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, local environment sources said.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, more than 30 famished swans landed in swampland
near an army base in Manasi County in northern Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen so many big birds in my life," said Guo
Dongwei, the soldier who discovered the swans, which are listed on
China's top-level animal protection list.
</P>
<P>
Local animal protection experts hurried to the spot and found
four of the swans already dead from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaozu, deputy director general of the prefectural
forestry department, said he thought the birds were too tired and
hungry to fly any farther, and simply collapsed when they reached
the army base.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snows late last year and steady low temperatures were
behind the swans' plight, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Soldier Guo has taken the birds under his wing and feeds them
25 kilograms of grain and mash every day.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is currently building a wild animal nature reserve to
offer a better living environment for swans and many other
endangered species.

output value last year, up 77 percent, after purchasing the Hefei
No. 2 Radio Plant.

<HEADLINE> "White Pollution Producers" Urge Recycling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Foam plastic dishware producers
are against the ban on the production and utilization of foam
plastic dishware, wishing it to be postponed indefinitely to avoid
the waste of millions of dollars worth of equipment and tens of
thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that the State Economic and Trade Commission
will not heed these appeals and modify the decision to implement
the ban before the end of this year, says today's Business Weekly
(China Daily).
</P>
<P>
Liao Zhengpin, president of the China Plastics Processing
Industry Association, said that the problem of pollution ought to
be solved through recycling, not by an outright ban.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 130 foam plastic dishware processing lines
in China with a total investment of more than 80 million U.S.
dollars and nearly 80,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
Six dishware producers from Beijing and Tianjin invested more
than 6 million yuan (about 720,000 U.S. dollars to establish an
enterprise for foam plastic dishware recycling in Beijing. And
more than 64 percent of the dishware in the city was recycled last
year.
</P>
<P>
Liao said that more dishware recycling bins will be set up in
large cities, such as Guangzhou and Shanghai. "Actually, white
pollution originates from littering dishware by the public," he
said, adding that "it is also very important to enhance the public
's environmental protection awareness."
</P>
<P>
The dishware is relatively inexpensive when compared with paper
dishware substitutes. And Liao, an expert with plastics research
experience of more than 30 years, said that the dishware poses no
harm at all to the human health and can be used safely.

<HEADLINE> Steffi Graf Accompanies Schroeders to Visit Hannover Expo 2000 Building Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf suddenly appeared in
the building site of Hannover Expo 2000. She accompanied German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his wife Doris to visit Expo
building site.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Steffi Graf said: "I am personally curious
about the Expo 2000 World Exhibition." Graf is still the image
ambassadress of Expo 2000 which is to be held in Germany for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Graf has cancelled all her farewell matches in Germany and
abroad because of her knee injury at the beginning of February in
Tokyo. Then she went to Las Vegas, the hometown of her boyfriend
Andre Agassi, to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit of the Schroeder couple to the building
site, which is the biggest one in Europe. In preparation of the
Expo 2000, a nearly 170-hectare district was turned into the
building site. Chancellor Schroeder said: "It is a great chance
for showing an opening and friendly Germany to the whole world. It
will be sure of a great success."
</P>
<P>
About 190 countries and regions and organizations are expected
to attend the Expo 2000, the biggest world exhibition of all times.
More than 50 countries and regions and organizations build an own
pavilion. Most of them will be completed before June 1, the
opening day of the Expo 2000.

<HEADLINE> Eight Iraqis Wounded in U.S., British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Eight civilians were wounded in
the latest bombing by by U.S. and British warplanes in southern
Iraq, according to local officials on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the tiny village of al-Fahd, which was hit by two missiles in
Saturday's bombardment, three villagers were injured and a number
of cattles were killed in the air raids Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The villagers expressed anger over the U.S. and Britain for
targeting civilian facilities and innocent people.
</P>
<P>
Ayad Khalil Zaki, governor of Muthana province, said in a
statement that the U.S. and British warplanes dropped 14 missiles
and struck two civilian sites in the province, injuring eight
people and destroying some houses.
</P>
<P>
He added that the continued aggressions by the U.S. and Britain
against Iraq are aimed at inflicting more damages to the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi military spokesman announced on Saturday that, at 14:15
local time (1115 GMT), the U.S. and British warplanes bombed
civilian facilities in the southern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier eight formations of the U.S.-British jets made 16
sorties over Iraq's three northern provinces, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes have been enforcing "no-fly" zones
over northern and southern Iraq, which Baghdad never recognizes for
lack of U.N. authorization.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between the warplanes and the Iraqi air defense were
often reported, while Iraqi authorities accused those planes of
indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets.

JERUSALEM -- The General Staff of Israel Defense Force (IDF) is
scheduled to submit on Sunday its plan for the pullout from south
Lebanon to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, local daily Ha'aretz said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, dubbed Morning Twilight and prepared by
the General Staff's Operations Branch, General Staff officers
warned that in the absence of an agreement with Syria, the Israeli
army would have to continue air and land actions in Lebanon even
after a unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the plan said that even after the withdrawal, the IDF
would continue to maintain bases several hundred meters into south
Lebanon, partly to save millions of shekels that would be required
to move them to Israel. (Israel-Pullout Plan)

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday
expressed doubts about a soon resumption of the peace talks with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
At the weekly cabinet meeting, Barak said there is nothing new
on the Syrian peace track and it is still unclear whether and when
the talks will resume, Israel Radio reported.

It is not rare for Ecevit to criticize certain neighbors, by
name or indirectly, for backing up terrorist organizations in
Turkey, but this apparently is the first time that he pointed an
accusing finger at Turkey's western allies on this matter. (Turkey-

<HEADLINE> 18 Hamas Activists Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Security Service (PSS)
has released 18 member of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
who
were in custody.
</P>
<P>
The move came under instructions from Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat before the Muslim Greater Bairam
that falls on Thursday, said Palestinian security sources on
Sunday, pointing out that no charges were levelled at the released
persons.
</P>
<P>
The PSS held more than 100 persons suspected of belonging to
Hamas and its military wing Ezzeddin el-Kassam last year to show
commitment to curb military attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Palestinian police rounded up a number of Hamas
activists allegely belonging to a Hamas cell that was reportedly
planning for bomb attacks inside Israel. Four Hamas extremists from
the cell were killed in a shoot-out with Israeli forces in the
Israeli town of Teiba.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Palestinian police said one of the suspects in
custody was a bodyguard of the Hamas leader and founder, Ahmed
Yassin.
</P>
<P>
However, Yassin denied any relations between the cell and
Ezzeddin el-Kassam.
</P>
<P>
Hamas will go on the path of struggle against the Israeli
occupation and settlement activities while refraining from any
attacks against Israeli civilians who do not attack Palestinians,
Yassin vowed.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Calls for Devolution Restart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
Sunday called for the reinstatement of Northern Ireland's
suspended political institutions.
</P>
<P>
He told a rally of several hundred republicans in west Belfast
on Sunday that the deadlocked Northern Ireland peace process was
entering a new phase.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he wanted to "offer unionists the hand of friendship
" but that they had "used their veto to derail the peace process".
</P>
<P>
He said republicans would only accept equality and demanded
that the province's devolved political institutions be immediately
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
The rally was one of a series being held to highlight Sinn Fein
's view that the British government allowed unionists to"veto the
peace process".
</P>
<P>
The rallies followed Adams' appeal in February for people to
show their frustration at the current political stalemate by
publicly by taking to the streets.
</P>
<P>
Talks hosted by Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson and
Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen in Belfast this week did not
find any formula for ending the deadlock over the suspension of
devolution and the paramilitaries' refusal to disarm.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Foreign Minister Visits Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy arrived in Berne Sunday for a brief visit to Switzerland,
according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government hopes that Levy's visit will serve to draw
a line under several years of tense relations, marked mainly by
the issue of dormant accounts from the Holocaust era in Swiss
banks.
</P>
<P>
Besides bilateral issues, the Middle East peace process is
expected to feature high on the agenda. Switzerland is one of over
40 countries engaged in the multilateral peace process which was
restarted at the end of last year after a two-year deadlock.
</P>
<P>
During a trip to the region earlier this month, Swiss Foreign
Minister Joseph Deiss offered to host a three-way summit between
the leaders of Israel, Syria and the United States. The proposal
received a polite, but non-committal response in public, but is
expected to be discussed further in private, when Deiss receives
Levy in Berne.
</P>
<P>
Israel has also made clear it wants to discuss comments Deiss
made during his visit to Syria. During the trip, Deiss described
Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights as illegal. He urged
Israel to return the territory, which it seized during the Six Day
War in 1967, as part of a peace deal with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador to Berne, Yitzhak Mayer, said he had
been"irritated" by the comments, and that Levy would ask for
clarification while in Switzerland. He added that the Golan
Heights dossier was very complex, and that the talks on Monday
would be an opportunity for Levy to outline the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Swiss foreign ministry said Deiss would
explain that he was merely reiterating a position long-held by
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Levy is returning a visit made by the former Swiss foreign
minister, Flavio Cotti, in May 1998. The Israeli prime minister at
the time, Benjamin Netanyahu, had been due to come to Switzerland
in November, but canceled the trip at the last minute, citing
urgent internal matters.
</P>
<P>
Relations had also been soured earlier that year by a failed
attempt by the Israeli secret service to spy on a suspected
Islamic militant living in Switzerland. Several Mossad agents were
arrested and one of them, who was released on bail, is due to go
on trial in Switzerland this year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Punish Violators of UN Sanctions on Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government is investigating 10 suspects for supplying material to
Angolan rebels in violation of UN sanctions, Deputy Foreign
Minister Aziz Pahad said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Those South Africans who had violated the sanctions would be
brought to justice to ensure the enforcement of the U.N.
sanctions, Pahad told reporters upon his return from a meeting of
the Organization of African Unity in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
 A UN report claimed that some African countries and some
South African companies were illegally helping arm and finance
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Three South African businessmen were allegedly fuelling
UNITA's 25-year- old war against the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations banned sales of arms, military equipment
and fuel to UNITA in 1993, after rebel leader Jonas Savimbi
refused to accept his defeat by Angola's President Jose dos Santos
in elections the previous year .

<HEADLINE> Yang Yang (A) Wins Women's Overall Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEFFIELD, March 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese women's top skater Yang
Yang (A) retained the overall gold medal at the world short track
speed skating championships which ended here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the 24-year-old girl from Heilongjiang
province in Northeast China became the first one in the history of
ISU world championships to take the crown four times in a row.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (A) collected 89 points from four individual events.
She was followed by South Korean An Sang-mi at 52 and Yang Yang (S)
of China at 47.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (A), who had her bid fainted yesterday when she
failed to make the finals in the 500m distance, regained the hope
after arch-rival Bulgarian Evgenia Radanova crashed in the 1,000m
event today.
</P>
<P>
Radanova finished fourth overall at 45 points.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 1,000m distance, Yang Yang (A) was clocked one
minute and 40.363 seconds to finish first. Yang Yang (S) was
second at 1:40.683 and Joo Min-jin of South Korea third at 1:40.
742.
</P>
<P>
Going into the 3000 meters final event, Yang Yang (A) was
strongly challenged by Radanova and An Sang-mi. At the outcome of
this very difficult and tactical final race, any one of the three
could have become world overall champion. However, once again,
Yang Yang (A) showed her mental and physical abilities by
confirming the title.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team coach Xin Qingshan gave an explain:"At that moment,
our aim is to win the overall title. Yang Yang (A) must avoid to
make mistakes in that distance."
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (A) also helped her teammates to win the women's 3,
000m relay.
</P>
<P>
The men's over-all gold medal went to South Korean Min Ryong,
who had 68 points. Strong contender Canadian Eric Bedard, who led
the rankings before the final event of the men's 3,000 meters,
could only manage to finish second at 63 points.
</P>
<P>
Bedard finished fourth in the final race in which he only
collected eight points.
</P>
<P>
Chinese quartet, composed of Li Jiajun, An Yulong, Feng Kai and
Yuan Ye, won the men's 5000m relay by a slight advantage over
South Korean rivals.
