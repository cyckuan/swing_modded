PEREZ'S DELIVERY FLAWED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers enter a critical three-game series
against the Arizona Diamondbacks tonight using left-hander Carlos
Perez, who hasn't won since May 29, a stretch of seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is out there because the Dodgers don't have a choice.
Although clubs are interested in the Dodgers' other starters,
Perez's poor season and hefty contract make him untradeable.
</P>
<P>
   So manager Davey Johnson and pitching coach Claude Osteen have
twice watched Perez work between starts and have suggested a few
mechanical changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things for a pitcher is not letting
the hitter see the ball during the windup,'' Osteen said. ``Carlos'
front shoulder has been flying open. Not only does it hurt his
velocity and control, it allows the hitter to pick up the ball
right away. He understands this and is working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteen wouldn't comment on Perez's work ethic, which has been
questioned all season, especially after he blew off the team's post
All-Star Game workout. The club signed Perez to a three-year, $15
million contract with hopes he would be one of the leaders on the
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Osteen said Perez's fastball, clocked around 81 most of the
season, has been around 88-89 the past three starts after making
his delivery more compact.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he threw for us, he went out to right field and worked
on it by himself,'' Osteen said. ``I don't know about the other
stuff, but my sense is he wants to turn this around and he'll work
to do it. He's a proud man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley sits: Before the game, Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley
learned the National League accepted his plea to drop his appeal
and begin serving his three-game suspension. It left the Dodgers
with just one catcher, Angel Pena, who homered in the first game.
But a doubleheader allowed Hundley to get two of the three games
out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   He also will not play tonight in the series opener at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something that was worked out between the player, the
union and the league office,'' said Dodgers general manager Kevin
Malone. ``I was in touch with (NL president) Leonard Coleman to
make sure getting two days in one was following procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was pleased that Hundley could cut a day out of his
suspension, but they could have used him in the first game, a 4-1
loss. Rockies left-hander Bobby Jones lasted just 51/3 innings. But
three relievers, all right-handers, held the Dodgers without a hit
in the final 32/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Losing Hundley didn't hurt the Dodgers behind the
plate. In the first game, Pena threw out Darryl Hamilton trying to
steal second in the sixth inning. Pena now has thrown out 10 of 31
baserunners trying to steal, a respectable 32 percent success rate.
. . . When the Dodgers made two errors in the first inning of the
second game, it ended a season-high streak of nine consecutive
errorless games. . . . Todd Hollandsworth, who had started 13 of
the Dodgers' previous 24 games and had three homers in his last
four games, did not start either game of the doubleheader.

UNUSUAL COALITION STOPS SHIPMENT OF WASTE FROM TAIWAN TO TACOMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An unusual coalition of Tacoma dockworkers,
environmentalists and a federal agency has stopped the first in a
series of shipments of potentially hazardous waste bound from
Taiwan through Tacoma to an Idaho landfill.
</P>
<P>
   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union No. 23 in Tacoma
said this week its workers might refuse to unload the material once
it arrived at the Port of Tacoma because they were uneasy about the
material's potential toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   The incident highlights a U.S. policy allowing the importation
of foreign waste that is drawing criticism from environmental
groups as the U.S. Congress prepares to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The waste in question this week was illegally dumped last year
in Cambodia, where its presence eventually ignited a panic that
killed several people. Shipped back to Taiwan, the waste has
languished for months at the Port of Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, a small portion of it was loaded aboard the
vessel Astoria Bridge. Environmentalists, alerted by a Taiwanese
reporter that the waste was aboard, turned to the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union for help.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials contacted a stevedore company, which went to the
local agents for the shipping company. The shipping company,
K-Lines America, ordered the material taken off the ship, said
Scott Mason, business agent for the union. Thursday, the ship
sailed for Puget Sound and the Port of Tacoma _ without the waste.
</P>
<P>
   Mason said the union implied that, in a worst-case situation,
the dock workers might have refused to unload the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have had a garbage-barge situation here,'' Mason
said, referring to the ship load of trash that was transported up
and down the East Coast in the late 1980s, while its owners
searched for a place to dump the load.
</P>
<P>
   The regional office of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
in Seattle also had requested that the shipment be stopped. The
agency's requests went to Envirosafe Services of Idaho Inc., based
in Grand View, Idaho, near Boise, which operates a hazardous-waste
landfill and treatment facility, where some of the waste was
destined.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the foreign waste illustrates how U.S.
policy allows importation of hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA acknowledges that it has no power to stop toxic material
coming over the borders, so long as it meets requirements that U.S.
companies have to satisfy for safe transportation and disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's from Tukwila, Toledo or Taiwan, the
company is on the hook for proving they are capable of handling the
waste,'' EPA spokesman Bill Dunbar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that prevents U.S. (waste) companies from
importing waste that is consistent with (U.S. law) ... since there
is no difference between foreign waste and domestic waste,'' Dunbar
said. ``The EPA's concern, as well as the environmentalists'
concern, has been, `what is in this waste?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some trouble getting to the bottom of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Envirosafe told the EPA that the only material in this first
shipment would be a load of triple-rinsed, 55-gallon drums that
briefly housed the waste after it was illegally dumped in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would not even qualify as hazardous waste
under U.S. law, said Mike Bussell, director of the EPA's office of
waste and chemicals management in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that kind of a reach,'' said Mason, of the longshore
workers union. ``If there is nothing wrong with those containers,
why do they have to go to a hazardous waste landfill in Idaho?''
</P>
<P>
   The trail of the waste begins at a Taiwanese plant, Formosa
Plastics Corporation, an international petrochemical company that
manufactures polyvinyl chloride pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the antiquated process the company uses to produce
chlorine, an ingredient in PVC, it ended up with thousands of tons
of a white, chalky, cakelike substance that contains mercury and
other toxic wastes, said Bussell of the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we know this far, there is nothing in there that
would present any imminent danger to human health or the
environment,'' Bussell said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Formosa Plastics hired another company to dispose of
the waste.
</P>
<P>
   It ended up dumped in an open field near the Cambodian port of
Sihanoukville.
</P>
<P>
   A dockworker who handled the material died after suffering
convulsions, according to unconfirmed reports. A young man who
rooted through the wastes showed similar symptoms, but doctors did
not conclusively trace his illness to the waste, said Jim Puckett
of the Basel Action Network, a group that monitors international
trade in hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   News reports of what followed show that riots broke out when
people in Sihanoukville learned of the dumping, storming the
offices of local officials they blamed for allowing the waste in
the country. One person was killed in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when heavy rains started, more than 10,000 Sihanoukville
residents panicked and made a mad dash out of town in an exodus
that killed four more people in traffic accidents, news agencies
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened and under severe diplomatic pressure from Cambodia,
Formosa Plastics agreed to take the material back.
</P>
<P>
   And there it sits near the docks of Kaohsiung, 357 containers of
the white, chalky waste, along with crushed drums and other
materials scooped up from the dump site in southern Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Puckett, of the Basel Action Network, is angry that local EPA
officials did not inform environmentalists and the longshore
workers about the supposedly non-hazardous waste on the way to
Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Bussell, of the EPA, said he also was surprised to learn
Envirosafe was going ahead with the importation of the crushed
drums that Envirosafe considers non-hazardous, given the
sensitivity of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue is whether the EPA will allow the far larger
portion of the waste load, which is almost certainly toxic, into
the country. Normally the EPA does not have to make such decisions.
But in this case, Taiwanese officials, smarting from the Cambodia
debacle, are refusing to allow shipment without preapproval by U.S.
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Envirosafe of Idaho, two other companies are
vying for the contract to handle the waste: Nevada-based U.S.
Ecology and Texas-based Waste Control Specialists. The transporter
was to be Onyx Environmental Services, a British company with 49
percent ownership by Waste Management Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Congress is expected to reconsider U.S.
waste-importation regulations as it ratifies the Basel Convention,
a 10-year-old international treaty on hazardous-waste transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be importing toxic waste,'' said Puckett of the
Basel Action Network.

FOR SALE: OUTFIELD WALL, USED, BUT STILL IN GOOD SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SNEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Old outfield walls never die. They just become
treehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Offered at auction after Safeco Field's opening, the Kingdome's
famed right-field wall fetched $215. The padded outfield fence went
for $8,501. And the rubberized, brick-red warning track fattened
King County's coffers by $5,014.
</P>
<P>
   The giant concrete mushroom doesn't get blown to bits until
March, but county workers are already ripping out its baseball
legacy to make a few bucks. King County, glad to be getting out of
the dome-owning business, collected $47,000 in a sealed-bid auction
this week.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the earnings came courtesy of the University of
Washington, which spent $25,000 for the Astroturf baseball field,
the pitcher's mound, two bullpen mounds and 50 cubic yards of
official major league baseball dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The UW will use the 52 rolls of turf, complete with a
five-eighths-inch-thick pad, for batting cages, an obstacle course
and training areas at the old Sand Point Naval Base hangars, said
Jim Daves, athletic department media relations director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good deal,'' Daves said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Curt Olosky thought when he bought the 28
22-foot-tall blue plywood panels that make up the Kingdome's
right-field wall for a mere $215. The general contractor from Kent
said the wood would be worth $3,000 to $4,000 new.
</P>
<P>
   Olosky said he would use some of the plywood to make a treehouse
for his 10-year-old daughter, Karlee. The wood that once was target
practice for Ken Griffey Jr.'s swings may also come in handy for
his general contracting work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I use it, I'll think of the Kingdome.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Olosky may just sell pieces as souvenirs _ ``I'll make some
money, but I won't make a killing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The panels come with four custom-made trailers used to haul them
around the dome. They'll be scrapped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mariners finishing their inaugural eight-game homestand
in Safeco Field on Thursday, county workers will help the proud new
owners of Kingdome paraphernalia load up their baseball goods as
early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That includes an item the county offered as ``this outfield
fence has major league experience. It bears numerous scars from
outfielder's cleats.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Bennett of Seattle on Friday is supposed to pick up his 88
plywood panels that made up the outfield fence. He won with a bid
of $8,501, said Russ Johnson, King County personal property
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdome workers Thursday painted over the fence's commercial
signs, but the new owner got permission from the Mariners to keep
the team logo and Jackie Robinson tribute unblemished as long as he
doesn't try to resell the M's logo, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The UW wasn't the only college to make a successful run at
Kingdome wares. Tacoma Community College won three bids: $1,005 for
a batting cage, $255 for a dozen light-blue vinyl pads and $255 for
4,000 square-feet of heavy-duty, dark-blue tarp.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the items sold, Johnson said he'll miss the dugouts most.
Christopher Ragen's $3,500 bid got him a pair of portable,
65-foot-long dugouts, including contoured benches of maple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sit on the ground, and can be moved with a forklift,''
the county's sale list said of the dugouts.
</P>
<P>
   Auction proceeds will go to the county's ball-fields-for-youths
program, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The next auction will come when the NFL Seattle Seahawks finish
their final season at the Kingdome in December or January. That's
when the stadium's seats and aluminum benches will be up for grabs.
The county has to move out of the Kingdome within two weeks of the
end of the Seahawks' season.

<P>
   DEL MAR _ They neglected to play Bing Crosby's recording of
``Where the Turf Meets the Surf'' on the loudspeakers before Del
Mar's season-opening race Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Think that raised a few hackles?

   And the good news is, that was as wrong as things would go on
the first of 42 days of action at the seaside stop on the Southern
California thoroughbred circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Management worried about its resurfaced main track, which drew
criticism from trainers and riders on the eve of the opener, and
feared a repeat of last summer's first week, which produced a rash
of horse fatalities and bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to hold your breath for nine races,'' said Del Mar
president, CEO and general manager Joe Harper.
</P>
<P>
   But for at least one afternoon, Harper need not have worried.
</P>
<P>
   The racing was dominated by jockey Chris McCarron, who won two
of the afternoon's three stakes, the $87,800 first leg of the
Oceanside with the appropriately named Domination and the $71,300
Fantastic Girl with Snowberg. Alex Solis and Mula Gula romped in
the $86,800 second leg of the Oceanside.
</P>
<P>
   The horse ambulance was called out once, to carry High Gun Ryder
off the track when the 5-year-old claiming gelding was pulled to a
stop by Chris Antley after finishing third in the fourth race.
</P>
<P>
   But the injury was reported to be non-life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   Track officials said High Gun Ryder reinjured a bowed tendon in
his left foreleg. Trainer Vladimir Cerin said the injury occurred
when the horse kicked himself during the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with the racetrack,'' Cerin said. ``I
think the track is excellent right now. It's the same as Santa
Anita, but it has a little more cushion. It absorbs a little more
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 season began with six fatal breakdowns in a brutal span
of six racing days, although the season total of 12 turned out to
be less than the recent average.
</P>
<P>
   The resurfacing, at a cost of $600,000, shored up the base with
limestone and softened the top layer with fine sand.
</P>
<P>
   Softened too much, according to one trainer and a few riders
quoted in the Daily Racing Form.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's first race made the track look bad. A field of nine
maiden claimers was strung out from the finish line to midstretch.
That could indicate most horses weren't handling the new surface.
Or it could indicate it was just a bad bunch of horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the soil) is a little loose,'' Antley said after the first
race. ``But it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell the truth,'' trainer Bob Baffert said. ``It's dry and
it's loose. When you add a lot of sand, it's going to be dry and
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, who began defense of his '98 Del Mar training title by
saddling third-race winner Captain Steve, said he thinks the track
will tighten up as the week goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes (track superintendent Steve Wood) about a week to
figure it out,'' Baffert said. ``Steve's good. He's just a little
slow.''
</P>
<P>
   The track seemed to tighten up as the afternoon went on and
displayed no obvious bias.
</P>
<P>
   Winners came from on and off the pace and from inside and
outside post positions. If anything, more winners took a path near
the rail, with only favored Snowberg ($6) and McCarron rallying
wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to form an opinion whether it's good, bad or
indifferent,'' McCarron said of the track. ``It felt fine to me.''
</P>
<P>
   On the thick turf course, McCarron and favored Domination
($6.80) led the entire mile to beat a field of non-stakes-winning
3-year-olds in 1:35.24, and Solis and Mula Gula ($7.40) took a
stalking trip to victory in 1:35.57. McCarron's shot at a stakes
sweep vanished when Perusing reared at the start.
</P>
<P>
   As with McCarron, Del Mar had a good day overall.
</P>
<P>
   The usual opening-day glitches were minor _ a balky turf-club
elevator, an ATM outage and some misprinted programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same thing that's happened every year I've been here,'' Harper
said of the elevator. ``It's the ghost of Bing Crosby.''

PILOT OF JAPANESE AIRLINER DIES AFTER SUBDUING HIJACKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The pilot of a jumbo jet with 517 people aboard seized
and disarmed a hijacker on Friday, but he was fatally stabbed in
the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacker, a Japanese man carrying a knife, entered the
cockpit shortly after the packed plane took off from Tokyo's Haneda
Airport, bound for the northern island of Hokkaido. The hijacker
forced the co-pilot out of the cockpit into the passenger cabin
and, by some accounts, demanded to be flown to Yokota Air Base, a
major American base on the outskirts of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese, including Tokyo's new governor, have called for
the United States to return Yokota to the Japanese authorities, but
it is not clear whether the hijacker was trying to draw attention
to the issue or particularly targeting the American military. The
authorities did not release any information about the hijacker, who
apparently was not injured in the struggle with the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   At some point after the hijacker entered the cockpit, the
captain, Naoyuki Nagashima, 51, apparently lunged at him and
disarmed him. Passengers on the plane then held the hijacker down,
but Nagashima had already been severely injured.
</P>
<P>
   The co-pilot returned to the cockpit and turned the plane back
to Haneda Airport, as a doctor who was a passenger worked
frantically to try to save Nagashima's life. Ambulances were
waiting on the ground as the plane landed, but just before the
plane touched the ground Nagashima died.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first fatality in 19 hijackings reported in Japan in
the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the reports about the American air base, there was no
immediate word on what the hijacker's demands had been, or why
Nagashima decided to subdue him. Normally, Japanese pilots and crew
are under orders to adhere to requests of hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   The airplane was a jumbo jet configured, like many Japanese
planes, to carry as many passengers as possible. It was full of
passengers bound for summer vacations.

KC OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NEW APPROACH TO HOUSING IN CENTRAL CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN HORSLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City's program to build affordable
houses in the central city in recent years has not been much more
productive than Habitat for Humanity's, which uses volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   A city status report shows that from January 1992 through
February 1999 the city and 12 nonprofit community development
corporations completed and sold 154 homes through the government's
affordable-homes program, with 41 more homes unfinished or unsold.
</P>
<P>
   Production averaged slightly better than 25 homes a year.
Habitat for Humanity averages 15 homes a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some homes on the city's status report compiled by construction
consultant Craig Wolfe took between 500 and 900 days to complete.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Jim Rowland was concerned when he saw those
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's occurred has not benefited that many low- and
moderate-income people,'' Rowland said. ``If the intent is to build
homes, we need to find someone who will build homes.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, city officials will present the first homes in a
development they hope heralds a new trend, improving what they
acknowledge has been a sluggish and inefficient program.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``The Olive Housing Experiment,'' the development at 20th
and Olive streets is a rare blend of professional builders working
with private banks and the city to promote home ownership and
neighborhood redevelopment in the urban core.
</P>
<P>
   Five homes are now open in a neighborhood that eventually will
have 25 to 50. They'll sell for about $90,000, but a favorable
financing package keeps payments about $500 a month with low down
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Vaughn, director of the Housing and Community Development
Department, said the consultant's statistics on earlier projects
tell only part of the story. Vaughn points to the Olive Street
experiment as proof that the city is on a more productive path.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes include developing homes in a concentrated area,
rather than scattered throughout the city, and using financing
strategies that help entice banks and professional builders to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues raised are valid,'' Vaughn said of the status
report. ``It takes a long time (to build the homes), and is this a
good use of public funds? We feel rebuilding home ownership in
Kansas City is a worthy expenditure of public dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said the City Council made a conscious policy change in
1992 away from multifamily rental units toward single-family home
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time, Vaughn said, no private developer of
single-family homes would work in the central city.
</P>
<P>
   The city then turned to community development corporations,
which are neighborhood-based nonprofits. They received construction
loans through a public lending entity, the Housing and Economic
Development Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn noted, however, that the community organizations had a
hard time finding reliable builders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Construction financing with federal funds is clumsy at best,''
he said. ``There's so much documentation before we can release the
funds. The builders need cash on hand. It was not a good match.''
</P>
<P>
   The community groups ended up working with small contractors,
who often lost out to large builders on workers and materials. ``So
timeliness and cost-effectiveness wasn't something we could
accomplish with that system,'' Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous contractors got overextended. Some walked off the job
or were fired because of delays. Builders also struggled with
vandalism and theft.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual site conditions also posed problems; contractors would
find buried houses or cisterns on sites that appeared vacant, or
they would deal with sewer lines 20 feet underground that weren't
contemplated in the bid.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, Vaughn said, the city began getting out of
the construction lending business. It began encouraging the
corporations to put together larger-scale development plans
involving multiple parcels.
</P>
<P>
   The city and the Housing and Economic Development Financial
Corp. also made a commitment that, once a home received its
certificate of occupancy, they would pay the interest on the
construction loan until the home sold. That provides some security
to the contractor and the lender, giving larger builders, with
their own private bank financing, some incentive to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're getting contractors with their own lines of
credit,'' said Karl Arterbery, president of the Housing and
Economic Development Financial Corp. ``The lenders are in it for
just a short time. It changes the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, the city has a goal of completing 43 homes
this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three are substantially complete, including the five on
Olive Street, and 13 have sales contracts, Arterbery said. The
community development corporations also have reduced the status
report list of 41 unfinished projects to 14, which should be
finished and sold within two months.

AUTHORITIES RAID SUSPECTED METH LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ State and federal agents went to arrest two
persons on drug charges early Thursday in eastern Jackson County
and found what they suspected was a methamphetamine lab.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities arrested four adults and removed two children from
the house at 5048 Glenside Court in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Jeff Seever of the Jackson County Drug Task Force said
officers from his agency, deputy U.S. marshals and Secret Service
agents raided the house to arrest a man and a woman indicted
Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Miller, 38, and Rhonda L. Major, 42, were arrested and
charged with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute
methamphetamine. Seever said Thursday afternoon that he could not
release the names of the other two adults arrested.
</P>
<P>
   He said that one of children, an 8- or 9-year-old girl, was the
daughter of one of those arrested and had been found at a meth lab
the task force raided in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Both children were taken to a hospital for an examination and
released to their families, Seever said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also seized computer equipment and chemicals used to
manufacture methamphetamine, Seever said.

AFTER DELAYS, SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF WITH FIRST FEMALE COMMANDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BETH DICKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ After a year of technical delays and two
frustrating waits on the launching pad, the space shuttle Columbia
blasted off from Cape Canaveral early Friday morning carrying the
$1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory, and vaulting its commander,
Col. Eileen M. Collins of the Air Force into the ranks of aviation
pioneers like Amelia Earhart and the Soviet cosmonaut Valentina
Tereshkova, the first woman in space.
</P>
<P>
   As NASA's first woman in 95 missions to command a space shuttle,
Colonel Collins was expected to face her greatest challenge less
than eight hours after liftoff when she and four other astronauts
aboard Columbia would try to place the X-ray telescope in Earth
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until 1978 that NASA hired the first woman
astronaut, so it's been a very gradual process,'' Colonel Collins,
41, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``Whether you are a man or a woman doesn't really
matter when it comes to getting the mission done.'' Colonel Collins
had logged 419 hours in space while piloting shuttle missions in
1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after a last-second engine cutoff halted its first
attempt, the 100-ton Columbia trudged off its seaside launching pad
at 12:31 a.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, launching controllers alarmed by an apparent
hydrogen fuel leak stopped the countdown just half a second before
the shuttle's engines ignited. The controllers later determined
they were fooled by false readings from a hazardous gas detector at
the launching pad; there was no dangerous leak. Columbia was
grounded again early Thursday when a sudden electrical storm
created risky flying conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A thinning crowd of VIP's assembled to watch Columbia take
flight. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her daughter,
Chelsea, on hand for the first two scrubs, did not return. Colonel
Collins' husband, Pat Youngs, an airline pilot, and their
3-year-old daughter, Bridget Marie, watched from the roof of the
NASA launching control center about four miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of 7,000 pounds of its own equipment to make room for
the most massive payload ever carried in a shuttle, the Columbia
was in orbit just nine minutes after setting the sky ablaze for the
26th time in 18 years. The Chandra X-Ray Observatory and its
attached booster together weigh 50,162 pounds. Lt. Col. Catherine
G. Coleman of the Air Force, 38, was to eject the spring-loaded
stack from the open cargo bay, 175 miles high on Columbia's sixth
circuit of Earth. An hour later, the attached booster was to ignite
and propel the telescope tens of thousands of miles toward its
permanent orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts would have two chances to deploy the telescope on
Friday at 7:48 a.m. and a few more opportunities on the second and
third days of the five-day mission if technical problems prevented
an on-time release.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandra X-ray Observatory is the newest in NASA's Great
Observatory spacecraft series. Chandra supplements the Compton
Gamma Ray Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with Chandra's software and hardware prevented its
launching as planned last summer. Chandra is to spend at least five
years in a highly elliptical orbit that will carry it one-third of
the way to the moon. From a control center at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., scientists will use
Chandra to observe otherwise invisible and often violent realms of
the cosmos.

EMMY NOMINATORS LOVE CABLE, KELLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After three years on the air, ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'' got its first Emmy nominations, pocketing six. But three
other things were clear from the primetime Emmy nominations
announced by the Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences: Everybody
loves ``The Sopranos,'' everybody loves David E. Kelley, and
everybody loves cable.
</P>
<P>
   The continued success of both basic and pay cable outlets is
reflected in the nominations for the 51st annual Primetime Emmy
Awards, announced by Camryn Maneheim (``The Practice'') and David
Hyde Pierce (``Frasier''), both past winners of Emmies for acting.
</P>
<P>
   Although the major networks haven't lost ground in sheer number
of nominations over the past couple of years _ NBC easily had the
most nods (82) this year, as it did last year _ cable outlets such
as HBO (74), A&AMP;E (20) and Showtime (11) got disproportionately big
shares of honors. HBO again was second to NBC in overall
nominations, as it was last year.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's freshman drama ``The Sopranos'' garnered the most
nominations of any program, 16, and became the first cable show
nominated in the dramatic series category. Other top vote-getters
included Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' ABC's ``The Practice'' and the CBS
miniseries ``Joan of Arc,'' all with 13 nominations each. Next came
an HBO movie, ``The Rat Pack,'' with 11 nominations, and NBC's
``Frasier,'' with 10.
</P>
<P>
   Cable channels dominated the categories of best television movie
and best actor or actress in a miniseries or movie for the period
of June 1998 through May 1999. Award winners will be announced
Sept. 12 during a ceremony that Fox will broadcast from Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This year's biggest gainer was cable's A&AMP;E, which pulled in 20
nominations, double the number it got last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled by the recognition,'' said Michael Cascio,
A&AMP;E's senior vice president of programming. The nominations cover a
variety of programming, including the miniseries ``Horatio
Hornblower'' and the movie ``Dash and Lilly.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominations illustrate ``how far we've come and how far
basic cable has come,'' Cascio said. ``This is just another sign in
the dilemma the broadcast networks find themselves in. They've been
hearing for years that their audience is decreasing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ratings as well as the nominations show highbrow
fare can attract viewers. ``People say you have to appeal to the
lowest common denominator to get good ratings. We don't think
that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer of some cable shows that got multiple nominations
said the networks, operating under different restrictions and
expectations, could not use similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show, as it is, could only be done on pay cable,'' said
David Chase, creator and executive producer of ``The Sopranos.''
Does he expect networks to try to emulate the style? ``No; I think
they'll continue to try to do what they do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Jodie Foster's Egg Pictures received four nominations
for its first TV project, ``The Baby Dance,'' which appeared on
Showtime. ``We're thrilled. Overwhelmed,'' said Meg LeFauve, the
movie's producer and president of Egg Pictures. She said the
company may produce more TV projects, but probably only for pay
cable. ``Showtime wasn't afraid to take a risk. ... It was a great
experience,'' LeFauve said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some creators seem to have the magic touch on network
television. Kelley's three shows now on the air received a whopping
29 nominations: 13 each for Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' and ABC's ``The
Practice'' and three for CBS's ``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the networks, CBS was the biggest gainer in the number of
nominations. The network, which also made a dramatic comeback in
the ratings this year, got 46 nominations, 28 percent more than its
36 last year.
</P>
<P>
   One of CBS's biggest nomination successes was ``Everybody Loves
Raymond.'' The blue-collar comedy raked in five, including one for
best comedy series, after three years on the air with none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond's'' co-creator and executive producer, Phil Rosenthal,
described the mood at the show's production office as ``very
festive, but a little disorienting; we're not used to happiness
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said he thinks the universality of the show is a key
to its success. ``Were you listening outside my window last
night?'' he said people often ask him. ``From the beginning, we've
steered away from social issues and hot topics,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Roberts, who plays Raymond's mother, thanked CBS
Television President Les Moonves for giving the show time to build
an audience. This was a fifth Emmy nomination for Roberts, who won
an Emmy for a role as a bag lady on ``St. Elsewhere,'' but she said
she was delighted by her first as a comedy actress.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Romano, who plays the lead in the show, said he wished only
that he could have shared the excitement with his acting coach,
Richard Marion, who died last week. ``Every week we'd go over the
script together. I'd worked with him since I got the show'' after
doing stand-up comedy.
</P>
<P>
   While thrilling, getting multiple nominations can crank up the
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does put a tremendous amount of pressure on you,''
acknowledged Chase of ``The Sopranos.'' ``I've had lower-back pain
for two years. Now I have lower back, shoulder and neck pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Those accustomed to nominations and awards may feel freer just
to savor the honor. ``It always feels good,'' said ``NYPD Blue''
star Dennis Franz, nominated for the sixth time.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill may wear off for well-wishers, however. ``The first
year I was nominated, I must've gotten 50 congratulatory calls,''
Franz said. ``The second year, it was maybe 30. Today, I've gotten
one call. But I have had several strangers stop me on the street
this morning to congratulate me.''

<P>
   The continued success of both basic and pay cable outlets is
reflected in the nominations for the 51st annual Primetime Emmy
Awards, announced by Camryn Maneheim (``The Practice'') and David
Hyde Pierce (``Frasier''), both past winners of Emmies for acting.
</P>
<P>
   Although the major networks haven't lost ground in sheer number
of nominations over the past couple of years _ NBC easily had the
most nods (82) this year, as it did last year _ cable outlets such
as HBO (74), A&AMP;E (20) and Showtime (11) got disproportionately big
shares of honors. HBO again was second to NBC in overall
nominations, as it was last year.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's freshman drama ``The Sopranos'' garnered the most
nominations of any program, 16, and became the first cable show
nominated in the dramatic series category. Other top vote-getters
included Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' ABC's ``The Practice'' and the CBS
miniseries ``Joan of Arc,'' all with 13 nominations each. Next came
an HBO movie, ``The Rat Pack,'' with 11 nominations, and NBC's
``Frasier,'' with 10.
</P>
<P>
   Cable channels dominated the categories of best television movie
and best actor or actress in a miniseries or movie for the period
of June 1998 through May 1999. Award winners will be announced
Sept. 12 during a ceremony that Fox will broadcast from Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This year's biggest gainer was cable's A&AMP;E, which pulled in 20
nominations, double the number it got last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled by the recognition,'' said Michael Cascio,
A&AMP;E's senior vice president of programming. The nominations cover a
variety of programming, including the miniseries ``Horatio
Hornblower'' and the movie ``Dash and Lilly.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominations illustrate ``how far we've come and how far
basic cable has come,'' Cascio said. ``This is just another sign in
the dilemma the broadcast networks find themselves in. They've been
hearing for years that their audience is decreasing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ratings as well as the nominations show highbrow
fare can attract viewers. ``People say you have to appeal to the
lowest common denominator to get good ratings. We don't think
that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer of some cable shows that got multiple nominations
said the networks, operating under different restrictions and
expectations, could not use similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show, as it is, could only be done on pay cable,'' said
David Chase, creator and executive producer of ``The Sopranos.''
Does he expect networks to try to emulate the style? ``No; I think
they'll continue to try to do what they do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Jodie Foster's Egg Pictures received four nominations
for its first TV project, ``The Baby Dance,'' which appeared on
Showtime. ``We're thrilled. Overwhelmed,'' said Meg LeFauve, the
movie's producer and president of Egg Pictures. She said the
company may produce more TV projects, but probably only for pay
cable. ``Showtime wasn't afraid to take a risk. ... It was a great
experience,'' LeFauve said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some creators seem to have the magic touch on network
television. Kelley's three shows now on the air received a whopping
29 nominations: 13 each for Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' and ABC's ``The
Practice'' and three for CBS's ``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the networks, CBS was the biggest gainer in the number of
nominations. The network, which also made a dramatic comeback in
the ratings this year, got 46 nominations, 28 percent more than its
36 last year.
</P>
<P>
   One of CBS's biggest nomination successes was ``Everybody Loves
Raymond.'' The blue-collar comedy raked in five, including one for
best comedy series, after three years on the air with none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raymond's'' co-creator and executive producer, Phil Rosenthal,
described the mood at the show's production office as ``very
festive, but a little disorienting; we're not used to happiness
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said he thinks the universality of the show is a key
to its success. ``Were you listening outside my window last
night?'' he said people often ask him. ``From the beginning, we've
steered away from social issues and hot topics,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Roberts, who plays Raymond's mother, thanked CBS
Television President Les Moonves for giving the show time to build
an audience. This was a fifth Emmy nomination for Roberts, who won
an Emmy for a role as a bag lady on ``St. Elsewhere,'' but she said
she was delighted by her first as a comedy actress.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Romano, who plays the lead in the show, said he wished only
that he could have shared the excitement with his acting coach,
Richard Marion, who died last week. ``Every week we'd go over the
script together. I'd worked with him since I got the show'' after
doing stand-up comedy.
</P>
<P>
   While thrilling, getting multiple nominations can crank up the
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does put a tremendous amount of pressure on you,''
acknowledged Chase of ``The Sopranos.'' ``I've had lower-back pain
for two years. Now I have lower back, shoulder and neck pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Those accustomed to nominations and awards may feel freer just
to savor the honor. ``It always feels good,'' said ``NYPD Blue''
star Dennis Franz, nominated for the sixth time.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill may wear off for well-wishers, however. ``The first
year I was nominated, I must've gotten 50 congratulatory calls,''
Franz said. ``The second year, it was maybe 30. Today, I've gotten
one call. But I have had several strangers stop me on the street
this morning to congratulate me.''

KXTA IS A GAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest foul exhaust coming from sports talk radio station
KXTA (1150 am) was just that.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon's show hosted by Newy Scruggs and Dave Denholm
was punctuated all day by tapes of flatulence, apropos of
absolutely nothing. Based on the hosts reaction and extensive play,
everyone involved apparently found it absolutely hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everyone.
</P>
<P>
   KXTA, after all, is the Dodgers' flagship station. Despite
having morphed from the family-friendly O'Malleys to the more
liberal Fox, a sense of propriety remains, and the Dodgers
acknowledged this week they have received complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The gasfest was hardly the first incident. In the last few
months, or since Mike Thompson was hired as program director, KXTA
hosts have made references to porno, gone off on women callers and
aired racially insensitive spoofs. One host, Denholm, has even
mocked some of the Dodgers' tradition.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for a comment, Dodgers vice president of
communications Tommy Hawkins responded with a statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers organization does not condone any racial
references, use of vulgarity or other indecent expressions,'' said
Hawkins. ``We have shared our concerns with 1150 and we hope
they're being sensitive to the outcry from the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the Dodgers organization in no way controls the
programming of 1150 other than Dodgers game-related programming.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to KXTA, many radio stations are stretching the
usual limits trying to find an audience in an increasingly
fragmented landscape. The youth demographic in particular is being
aggressively pursued, especially by AM stations that lost them to
FM music years ago. As a result, sports talk has become one of the
most prevalent AM formats.
</P>
<P>
   But when a station aims this low, it risks alienating those who
think bathroom humor should be kept in the bathroom. The Dodgers
want to attract younger and newer fans, but not at the expense of
their typical fan. And that fan is male and 34 to 54 years old.
</P>
<P>
   As one veteran industry source noted on background, the youth
market may be everyone's aim, but the fastest growing demo in
America is men 50 and over. Yesterday's baby boomers are today's
middle-aged men, and a majority of them will live into their late
70s.
</P>
<P>
   Low-brow humor has its place; Howard Stern has made a career of
it. A few years ago, the ``Sports Gods'' show (Dave Smith and Joey
Haim) made a sincere, if flawed, attempt at raw sports talk at
failed sports talker KMAX (107.1 fm). Station management at least
had the sense to air the gods late at night, when there are fewer
people to offend.
</P>
<P>
   That's why context is critical. The new ``South Park'' movie is
stuffed with crude, off-color and gaseous elements, but within its
own niche, it's hilarious. But you can't just drop the same
elements into sports talk and think people will find it funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little juvenile,'' KXTA's Thompson said of Monday's
show. ``That's the downside of the format. You want to encourage
extemporaneous bits and give your hosts some elbow room. This
format requires a lot of patience and some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he hasn't talked at anyone with the Dodgers
lately. ``There might be some things said that might catch their
eye,'' he said, ``but I don't think it's an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some irony in looking at what KXTA does and what KXTA
sells. The format may encourage potty talk, but Thompson said the
demographic the station sells most is men 35-44. And while the
station is the Dodgers' flagship, where some loyalty is inherent,
the hosts are told to talk to the average fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could become more of a hardcore sports talk station,''
Thompson said, ``but the truth is that you rarely see them stick
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Will KXTA stick around? Thompson said the station's Arbitron
ratings for the spring book (April-May-June) are up to a 1.5 in the
afternoon drive period. But other industry sources said KXTA is at
only a 1.2 for men 25-54 in drive time, and there's no way to
distinguish how many listeners tuned in just for Dodgers games.
</P>
<P>
   That weak rating alone would be enough for Dodgers' management
to consider a cure, especially since the team routinely earned
Arbitrons in the 3.0-to-4.5 range when it was on KABC (790 AM).
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have three years left on their contract with KXTA,
but one assumes there might be an escape clause or perhaps an
exhaust clause.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' day game Thursday was televised by Charter cable,
but don't get excited. It apparently was a technical malfunction.
The negotiations between Charter and Fox Sports West 2 continues
without a contract that would put Dodgers games back on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Fox yanked them July 6 because Charter had yet to agree on a
surcharged for the increase in the number of telecasts. Both sides
have been saying they're close to a deal, but nothing has
transpired yet, and it's starting to cut into usual viewing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Five Dodgers games have been lost this week, and another five
will be lost next week (July 25-29) if no deal is struck.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, said Fox spokesman Steve Webster, is that
these talks aren't just between Charter (in Long Beach) and Fox
Sports West 2. The negotiations relate to Charter outlets in other
cities and other Fox cable stations.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers to register your concerns are (562) 528-3401 for
Charter and (310) 286-3800 for Fox Sports West 2.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW THE NEWS:
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Hall of Game coverage includes an ``Outside the Lines: 60
Years of Cooperstown Debates'' special tonight (4:30 p.m.) and live
coverage of the induction ceremonies Sunday (10 a.m.). ESPN Classic
on Saturday airs a special on Latin ballplayers (noon), a replay of
Nolan Ryan's fifth no-hitter (against the Dodgers), and replays
inductions from 1993 (Reggie Jackson), 1994 and 1997 (Tommy
Lasorda).

L.A. STUDENTS' SCORES RISE IN STATEWIDE TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Students throughout Los Angeles and California
scored higher on Stanford 9 tests than they did last year, with
fluent English speakers and those still learning the language
posting modest gains in results issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the closely watched scores capped three weeks of
delay caused by mistakes made by the test's publisher, Harcourt
Educational Measurement. Even as they announced the results, state
officials said other problems with the results could still appear.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the scores on the tests, which are central to
California's educational reforms, show improvement in most grade
levels and academic skills.
</P>
<P>
   California students still ranked below the national average in
almost all subjects and grades tested, and Los Angeles students
lagged even farther behind. But scores for California children with
limited English skills rose in most grade levels. And composite
scores for fluent English speakers topped the national average in
all elementary and middle school grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``California students are doing better,'' said State
Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine Eastin. ``It's nice to
have something to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad, modest gains were reflected within the Los Angeles
Unified School District, where most grades tested topped last
year's scores and none posted a decline.
</P>
<P>
   But Los Angeles students continued to score well below state and
national levels. Local eighth-grade students, for example, achieved
the district's highest average for reading, reaching just the 30th
national percentile. The statewide average was 46.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to try to bring every kid up to at least the 50th
percentile,'' said school board member Valerie Fields. ``Reading is
the most important score we can look at, because if youngsters
can't read adequately, they won't do well in other subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Math scores showed the greatest improvement in Los Angeles,
increasing between one and five percentile points in second through
11th grades.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no scores drew more attention, however, than test
results for children still learning English. In June, individual
districts throughout the state began reporting enormous gains in
those students' scores. Backers of Proposition 227, the ballot
measure that all but ended bilingual education in California,
immediately seized the results as vindication.
</P>
<P>
   But those results had been inflated, state officials said
Thursday, by mistakes the test's publisher made in counting those
children, one of several glitches that delayed the full release of
test scores. Instead, scores for children with limited English
skills rose at roughly the same rate as the rest of California's
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly think it's hard to glean any conclusions about
Prop. 227 from these scores,'' Eastin said. ``It's really too early
to either celebrate or throw stones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Unz, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who wrote the
initiative, saw the results differently. His own analysis showed
scores for students still learning English rose 21 percent in math
and spelling, 18 percent in reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unheard-of for an educational reform,'' he said. ``Just
to give you an example, class-size reduction just improved scores 6
(percent) or 7 percent after three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Prop. 227 foes and state officials, however, noted that many of
those dramatic increases came because the scores for English
learners were very low to begin with, meaning that any increase
would look like a large percentage increase. Theresa Fay-Bustillos
of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund said
that while she was pleased to see improvement in the scores of kids
with limited English skills, the rise seemed to be part of the
increase for all kids, especially in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it really shows is there is something going on in
California at the lower grades, and it's premature and
opportunistic for Ron Unz to take credit for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just what caused those increases remains open to interpretation.
Eastin credited many of the education reforms enacted in California
during the last two years. Los Angeles school officials wondered if
reading intervention programs helped boost scores, although those
programs were started shortly before the tests were given, board
member Julie Korenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the increase may also come from students and teachers
adjusting to the test, which has now been offered statewide for two
years. Scores on a test typically increase during the first few
years it is offered, said Gerry Shelton, an administrator in the
state's testing program.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles school officials are still examining the scores and
hope to have a more in-depth analysis within the next three weeks,
said Liliam Castillo, the district's deputy superintendent of
curriculum and instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that school scores went up because they did a
tremendous job of instruction,'' she said. ``Or maybe they went up
because they had a different bunch of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials said on Thursday they could not guarantee that
the test scores would prove error-free, even though the glitches
found in the last three weeks have been corrected for most school
districts. Eastin pointed to a drop throughout California in
reading test scores between eighth and ninth grades, and said that
since other states have noticed the same decline, there may be a
problem built into the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the problem could be something to do with their
research, if every state is seeing a precipitous drop between
eighth and ninth grades and there's nothing to account for it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those problems, she said, the state should continue to
use the Stanford 9 test and pressure Harcourt Educational
Measurement to correct its errors. The company receives $22 million
for administering the test for 1,055 public school districts in
California. The test, she said, is too important to the state's
education reform efforts to ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have started down this path,'' she said. ``For now we must
have year to year results. ... I honestly believe Harcourt is going
to get its act together. This is the biggest state in the union,
and I don't think they want to lose this contract.''

SPARKS ARE RED-HOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life couldn't be better in Inglewood, where the Sparks are
playing like a championship caliber team.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of nine of their last 11 games, there are many reasons
for their recent surge and promising future.
</P>
<P>
   An inspired Lisa Leslie
</P>
<P>
   , who has been playing with purpose and poise since winning the
most valuable player award at the inaugural WNBA All-Star Game last
week; DeLisha Milton
</P>
<P>
   , who has been taking her shots and making them, plus playing
strong defense; Mabika Mwadi
</P>
<P>
   , the most athletic player on the team if not the league who
steadily contributes; and Gordana Grubin
</P>
<P>
   , the Yugoslavian native who is becoming more comfortable with
her teammates and taking advantage of her offensive capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the fundamentally sound La'Keshia Frett
</P>
<P>
   , who strongly prefers that you drop the La' when addressing
her.
</P>
<P>
   Frett, a fourth-round draft pick and former member of the ABL's
Philadelphia Rage, was awarded a starting role four games ago, not
that she cares. Frankly, it doesn't matter to the egoless forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care that we win the game and whatever I can do to help us
get that victory, that's all that matters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the promotion has improved her confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that it hasn't, because when you're sitting over
there and you're watching other people play it's important to keep
that confidence and it's hard to do it at that time. So to be out
here, to be able to play, it's just, what can I say, it reinforces
things. It gets you going again,'' said Frett, who replaced Tamecka
Dixon
</P>
<P>
   in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With her 6-foot-2 frame, Frett gives the Sparks an imposing
front court with Leslie at 6-5 and Milton at 6-1. She plays the
small forward, but is versatile enough to play the power forward, a
position she played exclusively in her first season with the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   Frett was slowed early in the season after suffering from
tendinitis in her left knee during training camp. She still gets
stiff after games, but it hasn't limited her effectiveness these
days. She got the coaching staff's attention after coming off the
bench to score 13 points and grab eight rebounds in 25 minutes in
the Sparks first win against Phoenix two weeks ago. Two games later
she was in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   She creates many defensive mismatches with her size, plus she is
agile, a good dribbler, great passer, doesn't make many mistakes,
and has a nice mid-range jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in my career I'm out there trying to do what I
can for my team. I care about doing a good job out there, not
necessarily (scoring) points, because there's more things that you
can do out there like play defense, passing the ball. I try to be
as fundamental as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the Sparks like her.
</P>
<P>
   For any girl, who dreams of playing in the WNBA, Tamecka Dixon
</P>
<P>
   can relate.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, dreamed of playing professional basketball, but her
dream was to play in the NBA. The WNBA wasn't even a forethought
when she was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   She understands the emotional strain and challenges young girls
experience, which was her inspiration for co-writing her first
book, ``You Can Be A Woman Basketball Player,'' (Cascade) with
educational author Judith Cohen
</P>
<P>
   .
</P>
<P>
   The book, targeted for young girls, chronicles Dixon's own rise
from youth basketball to becoming a professional.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said her aim was ``basically just try to boost their
confidence and let them know it's okay to be an athlete, there's no
knock on that.''
</P>
<P>
   As a girl, growing up in Linden, New Jersey, she often played on
boys teams. In fact, they chooseher because she was so athletic and
skilled. She was often called a ``tomboy,'' but she wouldn't let it
deter her. Her father, Russell ``Boo'' Bowers
</P>
<P>
   , among the nation's leading scorers at American University who
played briefly with the Cleveland Cavaliers and overseas, was her
inspiration and kept her forging ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was always to be the first woman to play in the NBA.
But then I found out there were opportunities (for women) to go
overseas to play professionally. I had the opportunity to travel
with USA Basketball and travel abroad and see some of the things
they were doing over there. That became my goal,'' Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA was born at the perfect time for Dixon, a Kodak
All-American at Kansas in 1997, who was selected in the second
round of the inaugural draft by the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to thank my mom and dad for having me at the right
time. It's all timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dixon is proof that little girls' dreams do come true
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   She'll be doing a reading from her book Sunday, 3:30 to 4:30
p.m. at the Borders Bookstore, 6515 Canoga Ave., in Canoga Park;
and Aug, 3, 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. at the Borders in Torrance, 3700
Torrance Blvd.

AUTO CLUB DEVELOPS SAFE DRIVING TIPS FOR MOTORISTS OVER 80
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A driver 80 and older is more likely to be in a
fatal collision than one of any other age group except the teens,
but they may need the independence they get from cars more than the
young do.
</P>
<P>
   So the Automobile Club of Southern California announced Thursday
it is trying to find a middle path through the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potentially, there's a really big problem out there, and we're
doing something to head off the problem,'' said Arline Dillman,
traffic safety manager for agency.
</P>
<P>
   She said senior citizens generally realize that driving skills
can diminish with age, ``but the seniors themselves didn't
recognize any problems with their own driving.''
</P>
<P>
   During a seminar Thursday at California State University, Los
Angeles, Dillman outlined the Auto Club's plan to survey older
drivers and use the information to create an education program to
help seniors drive more safely.
</P>
<P>
   For many, she said, driving is crucial to independence because
they don't have other options. Stores and doctors' offices are
beyond walking distance from their homes. There are no buses or
trains to get them where they need to go. Taxis are too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not driving or walking, they're stuck at home and
they're isolated,'' Dillman said. ``It's really critical for them
to be able to live independent, full lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we don't want unsafe seniors out there driving.''
</P>
<P>
   John Crnkovich, 75, said he drives from several hours each day
and he annually drives to Pittsburgh to see relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the younger drivers are more careless than the older
drivers. They're speeding, weaving in and out of traffic,''
Crnkovich said. He gestured to his Geo Prizm. ``I've got 145,000
miles on this car, and it's a '94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gotten a ticket in the last 20 years ... but my son
seems to think I'm a bad driver,'' he said. ``He's in his late 40s,
so he's no young chick, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Hip-replacement surgery last year temporarily sidelined Mimi
Traynor, 78.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughters did the shopping for me, took me to the doctor.
But this year I do it myself,'' she said. ``I've been driving all
my life. I'd rather be independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Simon, 78, not only drives his 1985 Mercedes regularly,
but for the past six years he's driven a van for the Wilkinson
Senior Citizen Center, shuttling people who can't drive themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are over 80,'' he said. ``They have problems with
their eyes or coordinating their feet, so they can't drive any
longer. I'm waiting for my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   A bill proposed by state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, would
require drivers 75 and older to pass driving tests to renew their
licenses. And as drivers age, their renewal periods would become
more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Now the renewal period for drivers is five years, but those 70
and older must renew in person at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden's bill has passed the Senate, and the Assembly's
Transportation Committee is scheduled to vote on it Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Marchesano, 75, said she considers herself ``a pretty
good driver'' but agrees that older drivers should be tested
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   She said a 10-years-older acquaintance with a
vision-degeneration disorder drove until he was nearly blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them are afraid to drive at night. They're afraid to
drive in the rain,'' she said. ``A lot of them live alone. Even if
they know they shouldn't be driving, they have no alternative.''

SPOTLIGHT ON BUFORD AFTER GLARING MISPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BUFORD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Damon Buford probably would have preferred being locked
out of the house. Perhaps it would have been better discovering he
had left his wallet at home while in the checkout line at the
market. If he had to have been struck Thursday with a twist of
fate, better it had come earlier in the day. That way, he would
absorb the embarrassment alone.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, fate visited the Sox center fielder in the sixth inning
of Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's game against the Orioles with the score tied,
0-0, and Sox starting pitcher Jin Ho Cho throwing exceptionally
well.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Brady Anderson hit a deep fly ball Buford's way.
But as the outfielder followed its path, the glare of the lights
hindered his vision. He planted himself in a spot he figured the
ball would land, extended his glove _ then all but shrugged his
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The ball sailed over his head and caromed off the lower part of
the wall. Left fielder Troy O'Leary almost ran it down, but by then
Anderson had passed second base. He didn't stop until he slid in to
third with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   Ever been driving along the Mass. Pike on a hot day when you see
someone on the shoulder, leaning against his or her car, the hood
raised, the engine smoking? The thought that probably entered your
mind at that time undoubtedly was echoed by players on both teams
when Buford lost the ball in the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Could happen to anyone. Glad it wasn't me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just try to go to the spot where you think it's going to
come down,'' said Buford. ``By the time I saw it come down, it was
all the way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson scored on a single by Mike Bordick, and after a B.J.
Surhoff single, Albert Belle followed up with a three-run home run,
part of a five-run, six-hit inning from which the Red Sox could not
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the time of night, I know he lost it because it was hit
so high,'' said Red Sox manager Jimy Williams. ``He didn't hit it
into the lights, but it was hit above the lights or close to above
the lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't see it. O'Leary, he saw it, you saw him run to go
back there to catch it. (Buford) moved to an area where he saw it
come off the bat. Then he didn't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The mishap spoiled what had been a solid performance by Cho (5
1/3 innings pitched, 7 hits, 5 earned runs, 2 strikeouts).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of lonely right now,'' said Buford, seated in his
chair before his locker with his back to reporters. ``I just kind
of waited for it to go down. That's the way it is. We're just
getting bad breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's tough, because Orioles starter Scott Erickson (8 innings,
8 hits, 2 runs, 5 strikeouts) pitched well enough to keep the Red
Sox at bay. His worst pitch led to a solo home run by O'Leary in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a reaction thing,'' O'Leary said about Buford's
play. ``That type of play happens. There's nothing you can do about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Buford had much support from his teammates,
particularly outfielders who have been in his situation, knowing
how difficult it is when fate calls upon you at an inopportune
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough ball, I had a ball there hit in that spot the
other night,'' said Trot Nixon. ``You just try to put yourself in
position where you think it might land, somewhere where you can
pick it up.''

ORIOLES GIVE RED SOX THE SLIP 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ORIOLES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There's no sense denying it any longer. The Red Sox
won't be waltzing to a wild-card berth in the American League
playoffs. They'll have to scratch and claw their way to a playoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear Thursday &UR;  &LR; night after a 5-2 loss to the
Baltimore Orioles before 33,605 at Fenway Park. After losing for
the second time in as many nights, the Sox now find themselves in a
virtual tie for the bonus slot with Toronto, which beat Cleveland,
4-3. Boston (52-44) has one fewer loss than Toronto (53-45). On
July 2, the Blue Jays trailed the Sox by 7 1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Boston has fallen from its lofty perch at home.
The Sox finished the homestand with a 3-5 record and now trail the
Yankees by six games in the East.
</P>
<P>
   With Pedro Martinez (sore shoulder) ailing, the Sox already had
to insert Japanese born-rookie Tomokazu Ohka into Friday night's
starting slot against Detroit. Saturday's starter is uncertain, but
if possible, it will be Mark Portugal, who has a sore back. The
loss Thursday &UR;  &LR; night went to Jin Ho Cho, who held the Orioles
scoreless for five innings, only to see Baltimore break the game
open with a five-run sixth. The Orioles did all their damage after
Damon Buford lost a fly ball to center off the bat of Brady
Anderson in the lights. Cho never had a chance after that.
</P>
<P>
   After three games in Detroit, the Sox visit the Blue Jays, who
have won six in a row. Oakland is two back in the wild-card race.
The Red Sox say they're not worried, but they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see what they're doing,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``But
we have to take care of our own games first, go out and win
baseball games. If you start worrying, you dig yourself a deep
hole. So you go play your schedule. I know (Cho) got the loss. But
for me, that's the best start that he's had since he's been at this
level. He really competed out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho did compete for 5 1/3 innings. He should have escaped the
sixth with one or no runs, but Anderson was credited with a triple
when Buford lost sight of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it off the bat,'' said Buford. ``But I lost it when it
hit the sky. There's nothing you can do in that situation. You go
to where you think it's going to come down, take an angle, and
wait. The ball landed behind me. Troy (O'Leary) had a good view of
it and knew I was in trouble. But he was just too far away.''
</P>
<P>
   The misplay was followed by singles by Mike Bordick and B.J.
Surhoff. Then Albert Belle really gave his Fenway critics something
to boo about. He lined a three-run homer, his 21st, just over the
left-field wall for a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore didn't stop there, picking up a fifth run on a
bases-loaded single by Jerry Hairston.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's offense only managed eight hits off Baltimore starter
Scott Erickson. They loaded the bases in the sixth and seventh
innings, but could only score once.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary hit a solo home run in the eighth, his 18th, but it was
too little, too late. Reliever Mike Timlin finished up to record
his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple chances,'' said Williams. ``We had the right
people up in the right situations and got only one run out of it.
We hit some balls good. But an `L' is an `L'. The ball goes up and
you can't catch what you can't see. Damon was in the general area.
But he couldn't pick up the ball. They got some more hits after
that. Even though he lost, I thought the kid pitched good.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his best English, Cho offered no alibi on his pitch
to Belle. ``Slider over the plate,'' he said. ``Can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   So bring on the next young pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it this way,'' said pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``He
was breezing along and a ball gets lost in the twilight. They
score. Otherwise he's got two outs and nobody on. Our young
pitchers have to learn how to pitch over those four outs in an
inning. Regroup and put it behind them and go get them.''

US FINDS NO MATCH FOR TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
 RICO-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ You know the saying: be careful what you wish for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will play them harder than they've ever been played,''
Carmelo Travieso predicted prior to Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's game against
the United States. ``We know how good they are, but basketball is
basketball. But we're in Puerto Rico and we'll defend what we've
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico got the United States, which is what they, and their
fans, thought they wanted. But the hosts ended up like every other
China and Angola that has had the misfortune to play the US when
the NBA players showed up: humbled and crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Final score, US 115, Puerto Rico 76.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready yesterday to play this team,'' said Tim
Hardaway, one of seven US players in double figures. He had 17.
``If you're going to talk trash, you gotta back it up. They didn't
back it up. We know how to back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The boisterous sellout crowd was hoping for what would have been
an historic upset. Tim Duncan (16 points, 14 rebounds) &AMP; Co. would
not let that happen. The victory improved the United States's
record to 8-0 as the tournament moves to the medal round. A victory
Saturday against Argentina will officially end the Yanks' mission
by securing a berth in the 2000 Olympics. A final, gold-medal game
is scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere inside Coliseo Roberto Clemente Thursday &UR;  &LR; night
was electric, unlike anything in the previous eight days. Every
seat was filled, most of them by flag-waving, horn-blowing,
basketball-crazed Puerto Ricans. The Finlandia City Dancers came
onto the floor waving a huge Puerto Rican flag prior to the
introductions of the home team.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a political edge to the proceedings. Many in
attendance wore white ribbons, a symbol of sympathy for the island
of Vieques off the eastern coast. The island is mostly owned by the
United States and the Navy uses it for maneuvers with live
ammunition. Last spring, an islander was killed during one such
maneuver, prompting the show of support Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. (The game
was shown on television in the United States on TNT.)
</P>
<P>
   The US team, which had been playing in front of friends and
relatives the past three days, finally got its first taste of real
international basketball. Since adding NBA players, a United States
team hasn't quite played the role of ugly visitor as it did
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night. (The players were booed when they came out for
warmups.) Only once has a US team with NBA players even played a
team on its native sod; the unstoppable, and lovable, 1992 team
pounded Spain in the Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking forward to this game from Day 1 because of
the crowd and their team,'' Hardaway said. ``We knew everything was
going to be against us.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was a concern that it might actually be a competitive
game. Or worse. Puerto Rico had the same record as the United
States and was coming off a huge victory over Canada. Their players
were pumped. US coach Larry Brown was worried about all the
distractions, ranging from late starts (three straight 10 p.m.
games this week) to long bus rides (45 minutes with a police
escort) to unchecked physical play. He also knew his team had
looked bored and tired, was playing its eighth game in eight days,
and was coming off uninspired wins over Brazil and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he got on the bus for the long ride to the coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all told me not to worry, but I have to,'' said Brown.
``That's a coach's prerogative. But I wanted people to see us play
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   How well did they play? They shot 56 percent and held Puerto
Rico to 37 percent. They forced 18 turnovers, blocked 8 shots
(Duncan had 4), and dominated the boards (53-31). And no one played
more than 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan started with a dunk off the tip and then hit a short
turnaround. Kevin Garnett (11 points, 8 rebounds, 3 blocks) added
an alley-oop and the Americans took a 10-0 lead before the game was
90 seconds old. The US converted on its first 11 possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come out and send a message, and I thought we
did,'' said Steve Smith, who led the US with 19 points. ``We had
been kind of sluggish and dragging the last couple games. This one
was big.''
</P>
<P>
   The only moment of angst came when Puerto Rico pulled within
36-30 with 6:54 left in the first half. Three minutes later, the
lead was back to 16. The US led by 18 at the half (53-25) and then
applied the coup de grace in the second half, using an 18-0 run
capped by a Hardaway trey to make it 81-49 with 11:46 to play. How
do you say ``garbage time'' in Spanish?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play together, come out with a lot of energy, the sky's
the limit, man,'' Garnett said. ``We had heard something about them
saying that we couldn't run on their court. You have to understand,
man, talking is for the birds. We just came out to play and to
smash all that talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And that they did. In so doing, a night of so much hope and
promise for the hosts fizzled as the United States, once again,
showed that at least in basketball, it still has the very, very
best.

ROCKIES SWEEP DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This wasn't a doubleheader, it was an indictment
of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Two games, two crowds, more money, less fun at Dodger Stadium.
And the best, or worst, thing about it all was that after getting
swept 4-1 and 12-11 by the Colorado Rockies on Thursday, the
Dodgers dropped into last place, yet barely lost lost any ground in
the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The division-leading San Francisco Giants have lost seven of
nine, including an 8-7 setback Thursday to the San Diego Padres.
Now the Dodgers move on to Arizona for three games with the
Diamondbacks, who are just a half-game behind the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that is reason for optimism,'' general manager Kevin
Malone said. ``We have hit a little wall, but the Giants are
struggling and we have shown in the past two weeks that we will be
heard from.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to remember that the Dodgers had won eight of 10
heading into this series with the last-place Rockies. They were
averaging almost eight runs a game, but were roughed up by a team
with a 6.11 team ERA.
</P>
<P>
   A more lasting memory might be the two home runs hit in the
second game by Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros. It gave him 22
for the season and 199 for his career. Rockies catcher Henry
Blanco, the former Dodgers farmhand, also hit two homers in the
second game.
</P>
<P>
   The only cheers of the day came in the second game when funnyman
Adam Sandler was introduced to the crowd and when Rockies first
baseman Todd Helton was brushed back in the seventh by Alan Mills
after going 3 for 3 with a double, homer and three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, played before 34,231, the Dodgers offense
died in the sixth inning when trailing by a run. Raul Mondesi
popped out on a 3-1 pitch with runners at first and second. The
Dodgers were never heard from again, failing to get a hit over the
final 31/3 innings after Rockies starter Bobby Jones (5-8) left the
game.
</P>
<P>
   It wasted a solid effort by an improving Chan Ho Park (6-8), who
struck out a season-high nine batters in his third straight strong
outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares?'' said Park, who allowed six hits and three runs in
62/3 innings. ``We lost. We need to be winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield, who was stranded at second when Mondesi and
Adrian Beltre popped out to end the sixth, was even more to the
point. He said this watered-down division race has made the team
listless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop taking these games for granted and start
playing with more aggressiveness,'' said Sheffield, who grounded
out with runners at first and third to end the second game. ``There
is no sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   The first game should have been a cause for celebration. Angel
Pena hit a home run and a single after taking over for Todd
Hundley, who decided to get two games of his three-game suspension
out of the way Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 23, he can catch two,'' manager Davey Johnson said of
Pena.
</P>
<P>
   In between games, they had elephants entertaining out in the
parking lot. The white elephants remained in the clubhouse for the
four-hour wait between games.
</P>
<P>
   The second game, played in front of 30,907, had plenty of
offense, but also five errors. The Rockies committed three but
always hit their way out of trouble. It marked the 10th time this
season the Rockies and their opponents each have scored 10 runs.
</P>
<P>
   After emergency starter Jamie Arnold allowed four runs in the
top of the first, the Dodgers came back with five in the bottom of
the inning against struggling former teammate Brian Bohanon, who
hadn't won since June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon didn't win this time, either. He was gone after three
innings after giving up seven runs, including a two-run homer by
Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek scored four runs in the second game, one short
of the club record last set by Steve Garvey on Aug. 28, 1977.

DODGERS: DOUBLE THE DISPLEASURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an historic day in the history of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, the first day-night doubleheader staged at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And I doubt those brave souls who chose to attend the games
Thursday or at least those rich enough to waste their money ever
will forget the unique opportunity to see the Dodgers and Colorado
Rockies duke it out for bragging rights for N.L. West Division
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   At least they won't forget the experience until, oh, the next
Dodger loss, which can come at as quickly as you can say Mike
Piazza, Pedro Martinez, Hideo Nomo, Henry Rodriguez and John
Wetteland. Or at least as quickly as you can say Kevin Malone and
Bob Graziano. Or Chase Carey and Peter Chernin. Or, well, you get
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers arrived back at Chavez Ravine from a road trip
rarity they actually won more games than they lost and they
supposedly were brimming with new-found confidence.
</P>
<P>
   I say supposedly because they went out and lost all three games
of the series to the dreaded Rockies including both Thursday in
reverting to prime season form.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped being aggressive and were lackadaisical out
there,'' said Gary Sheffield after the Dodgers went down in a 4-1
whimper in the opener. ``We didn't play with any sense of urgency.
Here we came home from that big road trip, and felt so good about
ourselves. But now we've taken a step backward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This game humbles you even when you're going as good as we've
been going since the All-Star game,'' said Trenidad Hubbard. ``It's
a very strange game, but you just have to keep fighting.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the one Dodger employee who has displayed a ferocious
fighting spirit this season, Rick Dempsey, isn't happy about the
17-day suspension he was dealt by National League president Leonard
Coleman for his part in the recent brawl with the Seattle Mariners.

   ``I don't like it one bit and I think it's unfair,'' said
Dempsey, the Dodgers' bullpen coach who watched both games from the
stands. ``I think they just tried to make an example out of me, and
it's just not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree.
</P>
<P>
   It's simply not fair that the baseball fans of America are
deprived of seeing Rick Dempsey work his artistry in the Dodger
bullpen. ...
</P>
<P>
   Will someone please explain to me why Davey Johnson is turning
his slugging first baseman, Eric Karros, into a platoon player?
Shhh, let's keep this from Davey, but Karros has been hitting
right-handed pitchers well throughout his career. ...
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park looked better than usual Thursday which means he
wasn't terrible. He struck out a season-high nine, gave up three
runs and yielded six hits in his 6 fr 2/3 innings, but one of the
runs came when second baseman Eric Young lost a popup in the sun in
the third inning. I can't figure out how a guy with Park's
commanding stuff can have an ERA over six for the season and
neither can anyone else. ...
</P>
<P>
   What, Me Worry? Seen dozing comfortably between games was Kevin
Brown, lying on the floor in front of his locker, legs propped up
on a chair and headphones covering his ears. He was a picture of
contentment, a state one reaches when one earns $1.2 million every
two weeks for six months of the year. ...
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield was walking around the Dodger clubhouse Thursday
with a Pete Rose tee-shirt, and thinks baseball's all-time hit
leader should be in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous a player who accomplished what he did isn't in
Cooperstown,'' he said. ``The guy might have made a mistake with
the gambling, but everyone makes a mistake. Peter should just
apologize, and baseball should get him in the Hall of Fame. He
belongs there.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. ...
</P>
<P>
   My ex pal, Tom Lasorda, is giving his name to a new cardiology
unit that soon will be built at Centinela Hospital. I hope I never
wind up in the Tommy Lasorda Heart Institute. ...
</P>
<P>
   I spoke to a high-ranking member of the major league
commissioner's office and he told me that Bud Selig will accept the
umpires' Sept.2 resignations without regret and with a smile. The
ol' umps are displaying the same erratic judgment they do so often
on balls and strikes. They are being led over the cliff by their
sheep-herding chief, Richie Phillips. ...
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if the Dodgers now regret giving up on Hideo Nomo, who's
9-2 with the Milwaukee Brewers and pitched a shutout Thursday
against the Philadelphia Phillies? ...
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad says the Angels are a house divided. Doesn't
surprise me. I've never known a lousy athletic team whose members
are perfectly content. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Ripken of restaurateurs, Mr. Phil Trani, actually took a
break last Saturday night when he shut down his North Long Beach
eatery. Of course, there was a reason for such temporary insanity.
He hosted a well-attended wedding reception for his oldest
daughter, Shannon, who exchanged vows with Todd Zalkins. ...
</P>
<P>
   What I find so unusual about all these Laker trade rumors
concerning Scottie Pippen and Penny Hardaway is that the team's top
administrator, Jerry West, isn't an advocate of either of them.
West privately thinks Pippen is too washed up and Hardaway is too
timid. I'd say the chances of the Lakers acquiring either guy isn't
too promising. ...
</P>
<P>
   There also has been strong speculation the Lakers will wind up
with Charles Oakley, the veteran Toronto Raptors free agent. They
might, but Oakley apparently would be giving up millions if he
comes to Los Angeles. The Raptors reportedly have offered him a
three-year contract in excess of $12 million, while the most the
salary cap-stressed Lakers would be able to pay Oakley next season
is $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no cinch that we'll wind up with Oakley,'' says Mitch
Kupchak, the Lakers' general manager. ...
</P>
<P>
   I notice two common qualities among the worst-conditioned people
at workout gyms they haul around water bottles and they gab too
much. ...
</P>
<P>
   Brian Golden, the Antelope Valley Press sage, informs me that
Cal Ripken Jr. (8), Tony Gwynn (19) and Chuck Finley (31) are the
only three players in the major leagues wearing the same uniforms
today that they did on May 25, 1986, the day Finley was promoted by
the Angels from Quad Cities. Only the trivia-conscious Golden would
know such an arcane stat. ...

   Nicholas LoCasale, actor-director son of long-time Oakland
Raider executive Al LoCasale, is staging a premiere screening of

CONCESSIONS CORRECTIONS A PRIORITY FOR NEW BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dedicated fans who have attended all or most of the
first homestand at the Guilty Pleasure can be grateful that the
Mariners have surmounted complaints about the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   What the club has done is make the stadium concessions a bigger
target for the public vent.
</P>
<P>
   It's a novel strategy, and cheaper than paying for a situational
lefty.
</P>
<P>
   Closed kiosks, missing food items, long lines and confused
service workers, not to mention 24 violations spotted by the health
department on opening night, were the major distractions keeping
thousands of fans from shaking their fists at the relievers.
</P>
<P>
   Makes for a colorful scene _ blue skies, green grass, purple
faces and red criticals, as the health inspectors call the food
funkiness.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints were numerous enough that Thursday the Mariners
announced multiple attempts for the next homestand to improve food
service, which verged on disaster during opening night partly
because of a computer crash that disabled many cash registers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the headaches are attributable to inevitable glitches
that accompany the opening of any major public facility. And part
of problem was the Mariners were overwhelmed by operating a stadium
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Groused one employee: ``It's not like they didn't know when they
were opening this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent that the pedal-to-metal rush to complete the
project left the concessionaire, Volume Services of America, with
little time to find and train employees and work out building
problems.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious clue was visible during Mariners telecasts in the
first half of the season. Every broadcast, right into July, carried
the help-wanted ad for the ballpark's hundreds of low-paying jobs
that would last for only 40-plus shifts over three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they ask us to promote (the job openings), they obviously
needed more help,'' said Randy Adamack, the club's vice president
of communications. ``The same thing was an issue at the Kingdome.
And people who know these things better than me tell me that the
economy is doing so well that these kinds of jobs have been hard to
fill in a lot of areas.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kingdome could offer more than 150 event dates annually,
and the King County facility paid vendors by commission, a more
lucrative policy than the Mariner decision to pay a flat, low
salary.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the county, the Mariners aren't particularly
answerable about policy to anyone except themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Facilities District built and owns the yard, but the
tenants insisted that they run the show, taking all risks and
rewards in exchange for a modest $700,000 annual rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PFD is in charge of seeing that the building and its
facilities are operated and maintained properly,'' said executive
director Ken Johnsen. ``There is no oversight in terms of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have forwarded the complaints to the Mariners, and they
have assured us they will get on top of it. It's a little like the
concession lines _ it's going to take a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnsen wouldn't comment on word that PFD members were hot about
the chaos that compromised an otherwise celebratory mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the Mariners' self-interest to fix these things,'' he
said. Then again, that's what folks have been saying for years
about the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Adamack insisted that the club didn't underestimate the enormity
of the new operation. ``Did we have problems? Yeah. Are we
disappointed? Sure,'' he said. ``A lot of things come together at
the end of a ballpark start-up, and I've been told that at other
places, concessions are always the last piece of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish it had gone perfectly. But we are dedicated to fixing
it. We care a heck of a lot about people's experience here. It's a
great place to watch a ballgame, but we also want it to be a great
place to eat, drink and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner staff and ballpark operations people are genuinely
eager to make the best of what they are handed in their splendid
new digs. But the confusion is yet another legacy of the compressed
construction schedule that created the cost-overrun embarrassments
and subsequent extortion attempt for more public subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   While concessions seem a small item in the grand scheme of the
park and baseball, food service is also the point of greatest
contact between the franchise and most of its public.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how the insignificant little hot dog looms so large in
baseball's iconography. The game and the link seem perpetually
linked, but the connection was hard to make in the first homestand
from the back of a 50-customer line.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the club bosses recently exhausted their public
goodwill, much can be bought back embarrassingly cheaply if they
provide an all-around good time.
</P>
<P>
   They would be well served to avoid promises they proved they
won't keep, and instead just figure out how to get a kid a dog and
a soda before he grows old enough standing in line to pitch for Lou
Piniella.

RASHARD LEWIS' VALUABLE LESSONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With every cold-blooded rejection, every ruthless jumper, every
acrobatic drive, every territorial rebound and every
gravity-compromising slam he registers in the Summer Pro League,
Rashard Lewis retreats from the unsolicited role of spokesmodel for
the NCAA's Don't Skip School campaign.
</P>
<P>
   According to his coach, the 19-year-old is ``just scratching the
surface'' in the excavation of a talent level that may require a
backhoe. With many similar evaluations in his portfolio, Lewis now
looms as proof that career-enhancing education is not the private
province of a college campus.
</P>
<P>
   But when your major is professional basketball, the course
requirement can be brutal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that the NBA is strictly business,'' said Lewis
after another promising performance for the Seattle SuperSonics in
their version of summer school at the Pyramid. ``Sure, I've thought
about what might have happened if I had gone to college, but I
stand by my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lewis prepares to stand and deliver, we'll offer a quick
history lesson:
</P>
<P>
   After being chosen as Parade Magazine's national high school
player of the year for 1998, the 6-foot-10, 215-pound forward from
Elsik High in the Houston suburb of Alief turned down a scholarship
offer from mighty Kansas and put his future at the mercy of the NBA
Draft.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-draft, individual-workout tour yielded evidence that
Lewis may be a star in the embryonic stage. It was hypothesized the
hometown Houston Rockets - who had three of the first 18 selections
- wouldn't let him slip out of Round 1.
</P>
<P>
   But on draft night, Lewis who has more potential than a vacation
without the kids didn't merely slip. No, he plummeted all the way
to Seattle in Round 2, the 32nd overall pick. The judge-and-jury
journalists who tut-tutted about Lewis' decision to leave high
school for pro sports (as baseball players have done for years
without criticism) wagged a collective finger in we-told-you-so
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The only people who seem happy about this ending are employed by
the Sonics, who passed on Lewis with the 27th pick they used to
select Vladimir Stepania. Coach Paul Westphal, for one, thinks
Lewis whose skills are signature enough to qualify for small
forward at 6-10 can be a great player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason why not,'' said Westphal, before
watching Lewis put 20 points, 7 rebounds and 2 blocks on
Cleveland's SPL team. ``He's so gifted and he will work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was willing to put in the on-court study time before his
rookie season, but the lockout prevented him from SPL-style prep
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the toughest thing for him was not having this,''
Westphal said of Lewis and the SPL. ``He just had two weeks of
training camp before we started playing. It was pretty much a lost
year for him, but I think he did fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the stats. Lewis played sparingly (an average of 7.2
minutes in 20 games, seven of those as a starter) and his numbers
(2.4 points, 1.3 rebounds) were meager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say he was overwhelmed,'' Westphal said. ``He was
just hesitant, which is natural.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis, the learned lessons of a rookie included a crash
course on pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I did better than I thought I would,'' he said.
``It was an adjustment for me, but I learned that you have to come
to play every night in the NBA. You can't show up one night and
play slow.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the mental application. The physical lab for Lewis will
conclude tonight at 5:15 when the Sonics take on a collection of
CBA campers in the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very important for me,'' Lewis said of the SPL. ``It's
my time to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we've seen the disproportionate blessing of size, quickness
and vertical capacity. But we've also witnessed seven turnovers of
Lewis' making vs. Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do need to improve my ballhandling,'' Lewis admits, ``and my
ability to take guys off the dribble.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal, whose obvious patience is supported by progressive,
long-term thinking, said it's difficult to gauge how much impact
Lewis will have in the NBA equivalent of his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say because our roster isn't complete yet,''
Westphal pointed out. ``But we expect him to pull his own weight;
last year was like a redshirt year.''
</P>
<P>
   And, by all indications, Rashard Lewis handled it with class.

DIFFERENT FEELING FOR GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Paul Caligiuri remembers the runaway train known as
the Galaxy last season. The team sprinted to a fast start, scoring
goals in record numbers while building an insurmountable lead in
Major League Soccer's Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   By the All-Star break, the Galaxy had virtually locked up
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, being the team with the best offense, defense
and record at the end of the regular season meant little. The
Galaxy was swept in the Western Conference finals by the Chicago
Fire, the eventual MLS champion.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri puts all that in perspective as the Galaxy prepares to
begin the second half of the season Sunday afternoon against the
Kansas City Wizards at the Rose Bowl. Game time is 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt much different at this stage last year,'' Caligiuri
said. ``We had such a big lead on everyone, every game didn't feel
as important. It was easy to relax, easy to feel comfortable with
the situation. That's certainly not the case this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization has gone through numerous changes since the end
of last season.
</P>
<P>
   First, Denver-based billionaire Philip F. Anschutz bought the
team for $26 million last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Martin Machon and Wellington Sanchez, and the
holdout of Mauricio Cienfuegos, hurt the Galaxy's attendance in the
early going this season.
</P>
<P>
   The team also started slowly (2-3), prompting the firing of
coach Octavio Zambrano and the hiring of former UCLA coach Sigi
Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Galaxy continued to struggle under Schmid. The
team that was once a scoring machine is on pace to score the fewest
goals ever in an MLS season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning of the season was definitely a disappointment to
everyone involved in the organization,'' said goalkeeper Kevin
Hartman. ``Last year we kind of put everyone out of reach and this
season we have struggled to keep pace.''
</P>
<P>
   As Schmid tinkered with the lineup, he sought foreign
acquisitions Elliott (New Zealand) and Roy Myers (Costa Rica). Some
questioned those selections, but Elliott and Myers have solidified
the Galaxy's struggling midfield. And now that they have had time
to adjust, the Galaxy is showing new signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will all start to work out now,'' said assistant
coach Ralph Perez. ``Seventy-five percent or more of our games are
against teams in the West. And when you're talking head-to-head,
you're talking six-point swings.''
</P>
<P>
   And lately, the Galaxy has solved its offensive problems. After
scoring only eight goals in its first 12 games, the Galaxy has gone
on a tear, scoring 14 goals in its last five games. The team has
also won five of its last six matches, including a 5-2 victory over
New England before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri said he saw the improvements coming and he knew it was
only a matter of time before the team started responding to Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Octavio took over the team (in 1997, replacing Lothar
Osiander) we went on a binge right away and completely turned
everything around,'' said Caligiuri. ``This time it took time to
make adjustments, time for Sigi to get to know the players and how
they play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets to know you individually so he's able to find a
balance and bring out the best in each player. He's made subtle
changes, bringing in Simon and Roy. And our training sessions have
been shorter in time but more intense. I think all of the players
have responded, both physically and mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the season, Schmid and the Galaxy can
focus on catching the Western Conference leaders. Colorado (12-4,
32 points), Chicago (10-7, 28 points) and Dallas (10-9, 28 points)
are all within striking distance of Los Angeles (10-7, 24 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt all along that we wanted to be within striking distance
at this point and here we are,'' said Schmid. ``We have eight games
against teams that are ahead of us and we need to take care of
those to control our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   When Schmid first arrived, his first order of business was
getting to know the players. He said it would take at least 10
games for the team to get comfortable with his system -- and it
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial goal was to establish a team camaraderie and have
confidence in each other,'' said Schmid. ``I think we've done that
fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for me to give a grade to this team since I've been
here such a short time, but we have made good strides forward.
We're far from an A (grade) but we're improving all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the midfield, where Elliott and Myers have
settled comfortably alongside Cienfuegos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two have had a big influence, but I think as a team
we've shown an ability to be more direct than when I first came
in,'' said Schmid. ``We're also defending better as a team in
higher parts of the field and we've improved our compactness, both
offensively and defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is plenty to work on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Schmid. ``We can defend better and improve
the quality of our crosses. I mean, there are a number of ways to
continue improving your team.''

M'S WIN IN 10TH, BREAK EVEN IN FIRST SAFECO HOMESTAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Like any new resident, they bumped into walls and
couldn't find the light switch at times. They tripped over unopened
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, the Mariners officially put out the welcome mat
and fastened their name to the mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   They ended their first eight days at glistening Safeco Field
with a 5-4 victory over the Oakland A's in 10 innings, giving them
a 4-4 split on their initial homestand. By finishing a frenzied
week on an upbeat note, they were able to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, it felt like we were playing on the road all
the time,'' designated hitter Edgar Martinez said of Safeco.
``We're getting used to it. It feels like home.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a sellout crowd of 44,311, the club's third full house,
David Segui's one-out bloop single to left field brought in the
game-winner and raised the comfort level.
</P>
<P>
   Now as a reward, the Mariners get to spend three days in a
Minnesota dome to open a six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up with that?'' reliever Paul Abbott joked. ``Can't we
go to Fenway or Yankee Stadium?''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott should expect plush accomodations. He finished out three
of the Mariners' four Safeco victories, throwing hitless ball over
22/3 innings Thursday in support of another engaging Freddy Garcia
starting effort. Abbott provides hope for a bullpen otherwise in
great distress.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mariners get more moved in, Woody Woodward, vice
president of baseball operations, cautioned against everyone
setting deep roots. The Mariners executive said he had talked with
a half-dozen teams about possible trades.
</P>
<P>
   Discussed were three types of deals: those involving left-handed
relievers, starting pitchers and every-day players for the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days from the trade deadline, Woodward said one-time top
prospect Ryan Anderson wasn't actively being shopped, but he didn't
say he wouldn't part with the young pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   He said a major shakeup, or a blockbuster transaction, wasn't
likely for the Mariners. He wouldn't rule it out either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you're going to see that in this particular
trade deadline, but if it came up, we'd listen,'' Woodward said.
``I'll tell you the asking price around baseball is pretty steep.
Closer to the deadline, that may change. We'd like to make
something happen to create more interest. The ballpark has already
done a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Safeco demands a different team than the Mariners built for the
Kingdome, which seems to necessitate change. In eight games across
the street, the home club was outscored 41-35, outhit their
opponents just 74-72 and were tied in home runs at 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell and Alex Rodriguez seemed to thrive the most during
the first run through the new surroundings, hitting .364 and .353.
Rodriguez had three homers at Safeco, including one Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Slow to find his niche was Ken Griffey Jr. In eight Safeco
outings, he hit .267 with just one homer and three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't play a Kingdome style of baseball anymore,''
Rodriguez said. ``We won't win games the way we won at the
Kingdome. We'll have to win games doing the little things: stealing
bases, playing good defense and bunting guys over. Those are things
we've never done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Rodriguez took it upon himself to show the way.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the 10th inning with a sharp single to left off
reliever Doug Jones. After a pitching change, the Mariners
shortstop moved to second on Griffey's check-swing chopper to
first. After Martinez walked, Rodriguez and Martinez completed a
double steal. After yet another pitching change, Jay Buhner walked,
setting the stage for Segui.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners first baseman lofted a ball toward Oakland left
fielder Ben Grieve that appeared catchable. But it fell from the
sky sharply and the duel was over.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and fellow rookie Tim Hudson of the A's had challenged
each other into the sixth, followed by relievers Jones and Abbott
trading great pitches into the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco Field held 676,346 paying customers for its first eight
games. They saw two extra-inning wins for the Mariners and two
defeats served up by former Mariners. They seemed to enjoy
themselves. How long they can put up with the club's frequent and
disturbing pitching lapses is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella says he will leave that in Woodward's
hands. The pictures weren't up on the wall in his office, but his
feet were comfortably situated on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't feel like home, I don't know what does,'' the
manager whistled.

FIJI RETURNS SATURDAY AT DEL MAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR -- Fiji, last year's top female grass specialist, makes
her return Saturday at Del Mar in the $100,000-added Osunita
Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   The Neil Drysdale-trained daughter of Rainbow Quest will face
nine othe distaffers in the 1 1/16-mile event over the turf course.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, who will carry high-weight of 124 pounds and be ridden by
Chris McCarron, won six of seven races last year and finished her
Eclipse Award-winning campaign with a victory in the Yellow Ribbon
Stakes at Oak Tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early spring she hurt a muscle behind, but it's fine
now,''` Drysdale said. ``This was the plan all along (to start the
year at Del Mar).''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well Saturday, Fiji will be pointed to the $400,000
Ramona Handicap here at Del Mar. The Ramona is being held later
this meeting (Sept. 4) so other top fillies and mares can use the
race as a springboard to the Yellow Ribbon and/or Breeders' Cup
Turf for Fillies and Mares.
</P>
<P>
   Racing fans whose lucky number is five should have liked the way
the meeting started.
</P>
<P>
   The first four races were won by number five, including 16-1
longshot Red Chili in the opener. Red Chili, ridden by Felipe
Valdez, breezed to victory and returned $34.40.
</P>
<P>
   The featured Oceanside Stakes was split into two divisions for
the 11th consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Domination's victory in the first division was worth $51,490 to
owner Stephen B. Weissman, and owner Steven J. Gula collected a
check for $50,890 thanks to Mula Gula's win in the second division.
</P>
<P>
   The Oceanside is a major steppingstone to the Del Mar Derby, set
for Monday, Sept. 6. The Derby is run at 1 1/8 miles over Del Mar's
Jimmy Durante Turf Course.
</P>
<P>
   Big Jag will go for his fourth consecutive victory Saturday when
he runs in the $200,000-added Grade II Bing Crosby Breeders' Cup
Handicap at six furlongs on the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Big Jag, who will be ridden by Jose Valdivia, Jr., has won eight
of his past nine races. The lone loss came in the El Conejo Stakes
at Santa Anita in January when Kona Gold registered the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold's trainer, Bruce Headley, is expected to saddle two
horses in the Bing Crosby -- Son of a Pistol and Lakota Brave.
</P>
<P>
   Laffit Pincay, Jr. blanked on five mounts Thursday and remains
68 victories shy of Bill Shoemaker's all-time win total of 8,833.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Noble Threewitt, 88, started his 60th Del Mar season
Thursday, but fans won't have an opportunity to see the star of his
barn this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Threewitt reports that Old Topper, winner of last year's Pat
O'Brien Handicap at Del Mar, is getting some time off and won't
return to training until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Jockeys Emile Ramsammy and Martin Pedroza will be gone this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsammy, fifth in the jockey standings at the Hollywood Park
meeting, has the mount on Bobby Frankel's Euchre in Saturday's
Prince of Wales Stakes at Fort Erie Race Track in Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Pedroza will ride Key to Success for trainer D. Wayne Lukas on
Saturday in the Ohio Derby at Thistledown Race Track.

M'S CLEAR MOYER TO START SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After experiencing shoulder stiffness and missing a
start, Jamie Moyer will return to the mound Sunday against the
Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer threw on the side Thursday without pain, and was given
clearance to resume his spot in the rotation, pitting him against
Twins ace Brad Radke in the series-ender at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing _ so far,'' Moyer said cautiously Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Observed pitching coach Stan Williams, ``He had a nice warmup.
He felt fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the pain reappears, Moyer will be replaced again by
Frankie Rodriguez, who spent parts of four seasons in Minnesota and
was claimed off waivers from the Twins in late May.
</P>
<P>
   A Moyer-Radke pairing will be intriguing, but Moyer missed a
classic matchup against former teammate Randy Johnson on Tuesday.
He was scratched from that one when he couldn't shake minor
discomfort after throwing eight innings in the Safeco Field opener
the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Both Moyer and the training staff figure Moyer's heavy workload
_ 138 innings, second in the American League to Baltimore's Mike
Mussina (144) _ caused the brief interruption in his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Considered the hardest-working man in a Mariners uniform, Moyer
has been durable since coming to the club in a trade with Boston in
1996. It's not hard to see why.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours before game time Thursday, the 37-year-old Moyer was
the only player on the field, for either team. He was running wind
sprints on the outfield warning track in the hot sun.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, Moyer was running pregame laps around the field
_ and other players who were doing less strenuous activity _ when
someone remarked to Moyer that he was working too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to,'' the pitcher replied.
</P>
<P>
   ARMS RACE: The Mariners picked up another pitcher Thursday, but
not someone who will provide immediate help. Trading
minor-leaguers, Seattle dealt outfielder Kerry Robinson to the
Cincinnati Reds' organization for reliever Todd Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Williams, 28, is currently playing with Team
USA in the Pan-American Games and won't return until early August,
when he is expected to join Class AAA Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   A closer by trade, the 6-foot-3, 210-pound New York native has
accumulated 83 saves in the past three seasons in the minors,
including 24 this season with Class AAA Indianapolis. He has had
two brief forays in the big leagues, appearing in 16 games with the
Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995 and six with the Reds in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a sidearmer,'' said Mariners outfielder Ozzie Timmons,
who has teamed with and played against Williams in the minors. ``He
throws pretty decent from down there, a sinker and a slider. ...
He's got good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   FASSERO REVISITED: He lacks confidence and location, that much
is obvious. But Mariners lefty Jeff Fassero still has considerable
movement on his pitches and the experience to turn himself around,
say A's players who knocked Fassero out of Wednesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero lasted just three innings, giving up five runs in a 13-3
defeat, including his 29th and 30th home runs of the season to
Ramon Hernandez and John Jaha. That dropped his record to 4-11 and
ballooned his earned run average to 6.86.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the game, neither Oakland player was aware that
Fassero led the majors in homers permitted. But once in the
batter's box, they saw a pitcher who couldn't throw a strike when
he wanted, and that meant opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get behind most of the time to the hitters, especially
in the big leagues, you're going to get hit,'' said Hernandez.
``But he has really good stuff and his ball really moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jaha, who hit a two-run blast, ``I knew we had to get him
early, so he didn't get his confidence. You could tell his
confidence and location weren't as good as it's been in the past.
But he's already proven himself. At any time, he can start throwing
good again. I wouldn't count him out.''
</P>
<P>
   WIZARD OF OZ: Thursday, the Mariners finally unleashed Timmons,
who hadn't played after being brought up from Tacoma seven days
earlier. He started in left field.
</P>
<P>
   In spring training, the 6-2, 220-pound slugger hit .579,
collected three long homers and could have easily made the club.
But because of an overabundance of outfielders, Timmons was sent to
Tacoma, where he launched 21 more homers.
</P>
<P>
   Timmons didn't circle the bases Thursday, going 0-for-2 but he
cranked one of the longest balls hit at Safeco Field, sending one
foul into the upper deck in left before walking his first time up.

ROCKIES SWEEP DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't a doubleheader. It was an indictment of
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Two games, two crowds, more money, less fun. And the best, or
worst, thing about it all was that after getting swept 4-1 and
12-11 by the Colorado Rockies on Thursday, the Dodgers dropped into
last place, but lost just a half game in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   Division-leading San Francisco has lost seven of nine, including
8-7 to the San Diego Padres on Thursday. Now the Dodgers, 8{ back
of the Giants, move on to Arizona for three games with the
Diamondbacks, who are just a half-game back of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky we're still in a position to get back in this
thing,'' said Gary Sheffield, who was retired in the seventh and
ninth innings with the go-ahead runs on base in the second game.
``It's frustrating, but we had been playing better and we showed in
the second game we're not giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to remember that the Dodgers had won eight of 10
heading into this series with the then-last-place Rockies. They
were averaging almost eight runs a game, but were swept by a team
with a 6.11 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   A more lasting memory might have been the two home runs hit in
the second game by Eric Karros, who now has 22 this season and 199
for his career. Mark Grudzielanek also had five hits and four runs,
both career highs. But Rockies catcher Henry Blanco, the former
Dodgers farmhand, hit two homers of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Until Karros' second homer, the only cheers at Dodger Stadium
came in the second game, when funnyman Adam Sandler was introduced
to the crowd and when Rockies first baseman Todd Helton was brushed
back in the seventh by Alan Mills after going 3 for 3 with a
double, homer and three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, played before 34,231, the Dodgers offense
died in the sixth inning when trailing by a run. Raul Mondesi
popped out on a 3-1 pitch with runners at first and second. The
Dodgers were never heard from again, failing to get a hit over the
final 31/3 innings after Rockies starter Bobby Jones (5-8) left the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was doing better, that the whole team was doing
better,'' said Mondesi, who was 0 for 7 in the doubleheader. ``We
have to put this behind us. We have keep moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The first game wasted a solid effort by an improving Chan Ho
Park (6-8), who struck out a season-high nine batters in his third
straight strong outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares?'' said Park, who allowed six hits and three runs in
62/3 innings. ``We lost. We need to be winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who was stranded at second when Mondesi and Adrian
Beltre popped out to end the sixth, was even more to the point. He
said this watered-down division race has made the team listless.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop taking these games for granted and start
playing with more aggressiveness,'' he said. ``There is no sense of
urgency,''
</P>
<P>
   The first game should have been a cause for celebration. Angel
Pena hit a home run and a single after taking over for Todd
Hundley, who decided to get two games of his three-game suspension
out of the way Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 23, he can catch two,'' manager Davey Johnson said of
Pena.
</P>
<P>
   In between games, the Dodgers had elephants entertaining out in
the parking lot. The white elephants remained in the clubhouse for
the four-hour wait between games.
</P>
<P>
   The second game, played before 30,907, had plenty of offense,
but also five errors. The Rockies committed three but always hit
their way out of trouble. It marked the 10th time this season the
Rockies and their opponents each have scored 10 runs.
</P>
<P>
   After emergency starter Jamie Arnold allowed four runs in the
top of the first, the Dodgers came back with five in the bottom of
the inning against struggling former teammate Brian Bohanon, who
hadn't won since June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon didn't win this time, either. He was gone after three
innings after giving up seven runs, including a two-run homer by
Karros.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Dave Veras, who saved all three games of the
series, allowed singles to Todd Hollandsworth and Grudzielanek, but
got Sheffield on a fielder's choice to end the game. David Lee, the
second of five Rockies pitchers, earned his first major-league
victory. Onan Masaoka (0-1), who replaced Arnold after three, took
the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be up in those spots,'' Sheffield said. ``It just
didn't happen.''

 BRADLEY'S PLAN TO FIGHT `SOFT MONEY'  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley
pledged Thursday to forgo millions of dollars in party campaign
money if he wins his party's nomination _ as long as his Republican
counterpart agrees to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Decrying what he called the corrosive influence of money in
politics, Bradley made his offer as he outlined a sweeping set of
campaign reforms that go far beyond the proposals currently before
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing breaks down trust in democracy as powerfully and
surely as money,'' Bradley said in an address before the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who is engaged in what is certain to be the most
expensive presidential contest in history, chastised front-runners
Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush for advocating
restrictions on the unlimited, unrestricted donations to parties
known as ``soft money,'' while at the same time directing their
fund-raisers to begin soliciting such cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the money machines start humming, let's pause and think
about a better way,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley left Washington in 1997 after serving 18 years in the
Senate, declaring at the time that ``politics is broken.'' He joins
Arizona Senator John McCain, a candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination, in making campaign-finance reform a top
priority of his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   For both candidates, it is a calculated risk. Although polls
show that voters are disgusted by the influence of money in
politics, they also suggest that the issue is far less likely to
sway votes than matters like education and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Bradley's fund-raising prowess that gave
credibility to his longshot presidential campaign in the eyes of
the political establishment. Bradley raised $11.7 million in the
first six months of 1999 as compared with $19.6 million by Gore,
according to reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission.
Bush has raised a record $37.3 million, while McCain has raised
$6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the Senate will debate legislation co-sponsored by
McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., that would limit campaign
cash. McCain praised Bradley's proposal, saying he welcomes
``another voice to the fight to take our government back from the
special interests and big-dollar contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's proposal would go much further than McCain's. Beyond
banning soft money _ donations to the national parties that,
theoretically, cannot be used to promote individual candidates _
Bradley would provide public financing for congressional campaigns,
require TV stations to provide free air time for candidates for
federal offices and ban corporate, union and political action
committee contributions in House and Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   Such measures would face an uphill battle in Congress, where
members have been predisposed against changing the rules under
which they won election. Bradley said, however, that if he wins the
Democratic nomination, ``the first thing I will do is to invite the
Republican nominee to join me in a compact: We will each direct our
parties not to raise or spend soft money in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan also includes measures aimed at increasing voter
turnout through instant registration, vote-by-mail programs and a
provision requiring employers to give workers at least two hours
off every election day.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drew a tepid response from the Gore campaign. Gore
campaign chairman Tony Coelho said Bradley ``would leave every
Democratic candidate, from school board to U.S. senator, to fend
for themselves while George W. Bush and the Republican money
machine try to buy the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson called
Bradley a hypocrite, describing him as a senator who ``never set a
reformist example (and) always milked the system for all he could
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the Texas governor
supports a ban on soft money contributions from corporations and
labor unions.

WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO FUN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ What's next for Stanlee Gatti?  &UR; From &LR;  Stanlee
Gatti?
<P>
   The question will send chills down spines of those who don't
share Gatti's vision of a brave new San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Ye of chilled spine should be warned: Gatti's still out there _
plotting, lurking, moping, hoping, dreaming, joking, smoking.
</P>
<P>
   There he is, behind the wheel of his black Ford Explorer
batmobile, a strange and mysterious figure on a never-ending
crusade to defeat the vision-impaired forces of mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Stanlee is stopped at a red light and he's got Ricky Martin
blasting from the stereo. ``Developing my superficial side.'' And
he sees something out of the corner of his eye.
</P>
<P>
   In the next car are two women, one of them holding up a neatly
lettered sign: ``Please stop smoking!''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti reaches for his note pad, prints a three-word invitation,
the middle word being ``my,'' and holds it up to his side window.
</P>
<P>
   The women speed away in horror. Stanlee has that effect on some
people.
</P>
<P>
   Last seen, Gatti was being shot in The Foot. He is San
Francisco's Art Commission president, and a proposed sculpture of a
foot, approved by the commission for installation on the
Embarcadero, was denied funding by the Board of Supervisors &AMP;
Amateur Art Critics.
</P>
<P>
   People came to call it Stanlee's Foot, even though the piece was
commissioned long before he became the city's art czar. The veto
was a big, big setback for Gatti.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; el,6 i  &LR;  T hat was three months ago, and he's still bummed.
Still laughs scornfully at Supervisor Mabel Teng's saying, ``If
only it was a
 &UR; hand. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   He says the rejection brought public art acquisition to a
standstill. The Art Commission was deflated, and many rich people
who were ready to help buy public art backed off, fearing public
ridicule like that heaped on the foot and its backers.
</P>
<P>
   I tell Gatti that this sounds wimpy. Shouldn't art patrons show
the same courage in the face of persecution that they expect from
artists?
</P>
<P>
   And doesn't the Art Commission have an obligation to keep
swinging for the fences, or resign?
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he gave up, Gatti says. It's more that he's
cautious, and very concerned.
</P>
<P>
   This is the city of his dreams, literally. He moved here 20
years ago, the day after dreaming of a city he interpreted to be
San Francisco. He made himself rich and famous here. But now he
thinks the city he loves is in a cultural death spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone just asked me, `What has happened to the  &UR; fun &LR; 
here?''' Gatti says. ``Everyone takes themselves way too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Result: The creative pipes of the city are clogged with the rust
of timidness and ignorance and laurel-resting.
</P>
<P>
   Stanlee is the Roto-Rooter man.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco, he says, is standing still while other cities _
Chicago, Cincinnati, you name it _ forge ahead with bold artistic
courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the major pieces (of proposed public art in S.F.) over the
last 10 years have gone down in flames,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He lights a cigarette and sighs. ``We don't think big here
anymore. We used to think big.''
</P>
<P>
   You can dismiss Gatti as a snobbish art bully, a guy who rose to
power by becoming the flower arranger to the city's overprivileged
and pal to Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But he has a point. San Francisco has always been a fearless
leader. The gold-seekers, the beatniks, the hippies, the gays, the
artistic and financial innovators _ they didn't sit around hoping
for unanimous approval from the man on the street before leaping
into stuff that was daring and that shook the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti's critics see him as an elitist scoffing at the rabble for
not understanding his quirky art tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be the person who enables the artists and
creative people within this town to live here and create here,'' he
says. ``If we can get visual arts into the public arena, everyone
can view it and contemplate it and question it and talk about it.
It encourages dialogue and thought, so people are stimulated to a
higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that Gatti has become, to some, associated with
giant spiders and mammoth feet and colossal peace signs. Cartoon
art posing as deep stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his office at Stanlee R. Gatti Designs on Howard Street is
tasteful and artistically appointed. Sure, there are some  &LR; quirky
touches. He likes green, so he collects books about San Francisco
that have green covers. There are a couple dozen identical green
cigarette lighters lined up like soldiers on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd hardly imagine this as the office of the man who would
turn San Francisco into Stanlee's House of Kitschy Art Horrors.
</P>
<P>
   I see him as a guy with a message. Wake up. Have fun. Be
different. Take chances. Be San Francisco again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into something with wild abandon,'' he says, ``it's
amazing, the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Just thought you should know: Stanlee hasn't gone away. He's
still here, still smokin'.

 &HT;    Spurn celebrity if you must, Neil Armstrong, but please write
memoirs
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ We watched the moon landing next door, at the
Bertrands' house, supposedly because they had a color TV. When I
look back on it now, I know that wasn't the real reason. We did it
because it was too good a story not to share with a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe it, we saw that first moon walk on television,
and heard the conversation of the two astronauts,'' I wrote in my
diary, filled with page after page about the Apollo 11 flight.
</P>
<P>
   Strange, when you think how large Neil Armstrong loomed in our
consciousness at that time, how little he is part of this
community's consciousness, even though he has lived among us, a
neighbor, for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Armstrong has lived in Lebanon since 1972, raising his two
sons there. (It's hard to pin down anything about the man's private
life, but recent reports have it that he now maintains a home in
Indian Hill, an affluent Cincinnati suburb, as well as a farmhouse
and office in Lebanon.)
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the most famous men in the world. Yet if you were
to take a survey, asking people to name Miami Valley's most famous
residents, Armstrong might slip the minds of many. He has kept a
presence, in short, that would make Howard Hughes seem
high-profile.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, the way he wanted it. In his shyness and
modesty, in his steadfast avoidance of the press, he reminds us of
that other world famous pilot/recluse, Charles Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   In this celebrity-besotted age, you can't help admiring a man
who spurns the spotlight. But there's a way Armstrong could emulate
Lindbergh with minimal impact on the privacy he cherishes: He could
write his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh, who had more than a bit of the poet/philosopher in
him, seemed compelled to write. His widow, Anne Morrow Lindbergh,
gave biographer A. Scott Berg unrestricted access to 2,000 boxes of
Lindbergh's personal papers.
</P>
<P>
   Berg's Pulitzer Prize-winning Lindbergh is so compelling you
find yourself on the edge of your seat during his account of the
transatlantic flight, wondering how it will all turn out. That kind
of writing would not have been possible without Lindbergh's
voluminous written record of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, a Life magazine editor asked Lindbergh to write about
the astronauts' moon mission in the context of history's other
great adventures. He wrote a refusal letter so compelling it was
published in the July 4, 1969, issue of Life. ``Forty-two years
ago,'' he wrote, ``bucking a headwind on a flight in my monoplane
between New York and St. Louis, I tried to look into the future
beyond man's conquest of the air. As the wheel had opened land to
modern travel, and the hull the sea, wings had opened the
relatively universal sky. Only space lay beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks in Lebanon, ever protective of Armstrong, are irritated by
naysayers who suggest the first man on the moon should hone his PR
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the nerves of steel and intelligence,'' said Jack
Hedges, a Lebanon attorney and former mayor. ``Part of what enabled
him to do what he did is that he was a private person.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the people of Lebanon don't need parade rides and
speeches to know that Armstrong is one of them. ``Neil Armstrong is
Neil Armstrong and has everyone's admiration and respect for the
person he is,'' Hedges said. ``He is truly a man of destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   After arguing forcefully that Armstrong has earned his privacy,
Hedges concedes he would love to read the astronaut's memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   So go ahead, Mr. Armstrong, avoid if you must the parades and
the speeches (and, yes, even the press). But, for heaven's sake,
Neil, write the book.
</P>
<P>
   It's too good a story not to share with a neighbor.

 &HT;    Comtemporaries turning aging process upside down
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ If my failing memory is correct, John
Glenn, at age 41, was the oldest of the original astronauts when he
made his first space trip. I remember Gene Patterson's column in
The Atlanta Constitution the next morning. Having just hit the big
Four-Oh himself, editor Patterson, instead of bragging about
catching up with the Russians, waxed eloquently about what Glenn's
feat had done to boost the egos of aging American men.
</P>
<P>
   I could hardly imagine anyone that old being up to a space ride.
Now we know better. In 1962, John Glenn was barely out of diapers.
We had no idea he'd be back up there nearly 40 years later, except
as a member of the dearly departed.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm a bit past 40 myself, I have a greater appreciation
for old folks who are an example for other old folks. The phone
rang while we were eating breakfast. Pepper Rodgers, the once
Georgia Tech football coach, was calling from Memphis, Tenn. I
don't know exactly how old Pepper is, but a couple of years ago he
asked me if I had both Part A and Part B on my Medicare card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pepper,'' I said. ``It's 6 o'clock in Memphis. Why are you
calling so early?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm running for mayor,'' he announced. ``I need
advice. What should I put on my campaign posters? Coach Rodgers,
Pepper Rodgers or just plain Pepper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you decide to run?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday,'' he said. ``All I had to do was pay a $100 fee and
get 25 signatures. I got 50 in less than a half hour. When I went
to City Hall to pay the $100, people were just coming in to work. I
promised them if they'd help me get elected mayor I'd fire their
bosses and give them the jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't too surprised to learn Pepper had tossed his cap into
the political arena. Being a football coach is close to being a
politician, and Pepper has politics in his genes. Old-timers will
recall that his father ran for something every year Atlanta had an
election, just for the fun of it. Once Franklin surprised
everybody, including himself, by being elected to the school board.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper had made me feel several years younger before I got a
call from Gene Asher, another free spirit who has been brightening
the Atlanta scene for more than a half century. When I told Gene
about Pepper running for mayor in Memphis he reminded me that his
brother in Florida is running for his third term as mayor of
Daytona. ``How old is Buddy?'' I asked. Gene said 74.
</P>
<P>
   Gene was calling to remind me it was time for us to have lunch
with Noah Langdale. Having obtained diplomas from the University of
Georgia only through the generosity of friendly professors, Gene
and I can't recall exactly how we became lunch companions with the
erudite scholar. Noah's lengthy resume includes Phi Beta Kappa
Alabama, Harvard Law, Rose Bowl tackle, university president
(Georgia State).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Langdale has an ancient Fayetteville connection that
possibly enables him to overlook my intellectual Sahara. He was
making a ladies' night speech to the Kiwanis club when the Masonic
Hall sprang a gas leak and everybody had to be hauled to Grady
Hospital for emergency treatment. That was before we had local
hospitals and medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   Gene said to come to his place, then we'd pick up Noah. When I
got there, Gene said we we'd ride in his car, which turned out to
be a new Chrysler convertible. ``We'll put the top down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered a South Georgia ole boy's summation of his good
life: ``I've kissed a pretty girl at the junior-senior prom, sailed
under the Golden Gate Bridge coming home from the war, caught a
bass big enough to hang over the fireplace, drunk cold beer out of
long-neck bottles and rode in a convertible with the top down.''
</P>
<P>
   So there we were, in the middle of Atlanta's nightlife district,
in Gene's shiny new convertible, with the top down. People didn't
really begin to stare until Gene popped in a CD and turned up the
volume. From what I can tell, both Gene and Noah are a little hard
of hearing.
</P>
<P>
   They love college fight songs. They sing along. They were fight,
fight, fighting for old Notre Dame at boombox level when we paused
for a stoplight. Gene stood up behind the wheel, struck a
quarterback's picture-day pose, and shouted: ``Angelo Bertelli!''
Who else in the Buckhead lunch crowd remembers a 1940s vintage
quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the Fish Market, they were belting out ``On
Wisconsin,'' two white-haired frat boys in a convertible with the
top down. Nobody would have believed they're teetotalers. Several
smartly dressed whippersnappers waiting at valet parking could
hardly stifle snickers when we drove up and began making our way
inside on arthritic knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weren't you embarrassed?'' my wife wanted to know when I
described the scene that night at supper.
</P>
<P>
   Of course I wasn't embarrassed. I was inspired.

 &HT;    A puzzling salute
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ John Fitzgerald Kennedy was my commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women in uniform are supposed to respect their
commander-in-chief. With President Kennedy, however, everyone I
knew in uniform respected the man as much as they did the position
he held.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was a military man himself. He served during World War
II. He was a battle veteran. Severely wounded in action, he
conducted himself above and beyond the call of duty.
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy put us on full alert during the Cuban missile
crisis, it helped to know that the person calling the shots had
been there and done it heroically.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Kennedy was assassinated, most Americans, if not
most people worldwide, felt the loss of a proven leader who had the
potential to make the world better.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had proven himself as a scholar, a prize-winning writer,
a war hero, a bold leader and a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   The outpouring of sorrow at the news of Kennedy's death in
Dallas in 1963 was understandable even to his enemies. Kennedy was
a tested leader in the midst of a red-hot cold war. He was a man of
considerable personal accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the outpouring of sorrow at the news of the untimely
death of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. is less understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it is a tragedy that JFK Jr., his wife and his
sister-in-law lost their lives in a plane crash off Martha's
Vineyard in Massachusetts. Premature deaths always are tragic.
Young people should have the opportunity to experience all of
life's seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect I have with the grief-stricken reactions of
average Americans at the news of Kennedy's plane crash is similar
to the difficulty I had understanding the emotional suffering
Americans showed upon learning that Princess Diana had been killed
in a car crash in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, President Kennedy had proven potential
to accomplish a great deal more. President Kennedy was a man of
celebrated accomplishments. John Jr. and Princess Di were
accomplished celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   The young Kennedy's greatest apparent accomplishment was his
attempt to parlay celebrity and politics into George, his glossy
low-circulation magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making a career based on glamour in politics may
eventually prove to be a stroke of genius. Maybe, maybe not. We do
know that after flunking the bar exam twice, the handsome young man
admitted, ``I'm clearly not a major legal genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people who have expressed heartfelt anguish over the news of
Kennedy's plane crash knew much about the young man. Like Princess
Di, Kennedy spent most of his life sheltered from public view.
</P>
<P>
   Americans old enough to remember his father's assassination,
also remember John John _ a term of endearment _ it turns out, that
was made up by mistake by a reporter and was never used by family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Americans of a certain age remember the boy in short pants
saluting his father's passing coffin. They remember the photograph
of the boy playing under his father's desk in the Oval Office. And
they remember all the other photos of the boy and his family
released to the press. After that, the tabloids and the celebrity
press carried occasional photos or tidbits about the young man
until he blossomed into a celebrity hunk after college.
</P>
<P>
   I have this lingering feeling that the worldwide outpouring of
grief over the loss of Princess Diana and John F. Kennedy Jr. was
motivated in the main by good looks and glamour, attributes that
should not be confused with hard-won personal accomplishments.

 &HT;    Modern life may be causing rise in number with asthma
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, July 25.)
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Why some people get asthma and others do not _
especially family members of the same household _ remains one of
the biggest mysteries of the chronic respiratory disease. ``We know
it's an interaction between genetics and how your immune system
responds to the world,'' said Dr. Gerald Teague, head of Emory's
Asthma Clinic. ``But why there's more of it, and why it's worse
than ever, is the big question.''
</P>
<P>
   In asthma patients, the airways of the lungs are overly reactive
and inflamed; during an asthma episode, they become temporarily
narrowed by tissue swelling or blocked by excess mucus, leaving
patients gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   The triggers that worsen asthma have been identified: dustmites,
cockroaches, mold, tobacco smoke, air pollution, and some chemicals
and foods. Heat, humidity and pollen also add up to miserable days
for people prone to allergies and asthma.
</P>
<P>
   While many are quick to blame smog and the urban ozone created
by too many cars, air pollution is just one of the culprits,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors have converged with smog to bring about the asthma
epidemic, such as home design, a sedentary lifestyle and a diet
loaded with fat and preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   People stay inside homes breathing in allergens their
grandparents did not. Carpets cover wooden floors, endless
compositions of artificial fabric and chemicals wrap around
furniture, drapes and insulation. And air conditioning and high
crime have made opening a window seem primitive or dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of steady, accessible health care, and substandard homes
that may be laden with asthma triggers are probably the main
reasons asthma rates are four times higher among urban, poor
African-Americans than among whites, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   The increase of smoking by women probably contributes to why
females recorded the biggest spike of asthma prevalence among any
group in the United States _ an increase of 81 percent from 1982 to
1994, twice the rate of males. More definitive answers are expected
from a five-year American Lung Association asthma project under way
in 19 research centers, including Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies will look at causes and effects of different asthma
medicine as well as include basic cell-level research on how lungs
respond,'' said Charles White of Georgia's American Lung
Association. ``It's designed to really explore causes and cures.

 &HT;    Programs teach families how to attack asthma
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, July 25.)
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First, they ripped out the carpeting. Then they moved
the rugs out of their children's bedrooms and switched from
curtains to blinds.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Danielle and Vencent Geddis declared war on dust, clutter
and piles of anything and everything _ clothes, papers, toys. Even
indoor plants and outdoor puppies were rearranged on doctor's
orders.
</P>
<P>
   The Geddis family is combating asthma by confronting its common
household triggers, such as pet dander, mold, cockroaches and the
chemical allergens and dust that may lurk in bedding, carpets and
drapes. They are also learning to better manage the chronic
condition that regularly sent their oldest son, Ti-Mel Cameron, 12,
to the emergency room gasping for air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were constantly back and forth to hospitals,'' his mother,
Danielle, said. ``In 1998, he was admitted seven times, just that
year alone, to Scottish Rite (Children's Hospital), and he'd stay a
week or so. It got to the point where he'd ask, `Am I going to be
in the same room?'''
</P>
<P>
   Like an increasing number of parents in the Atlanta area, the
Geddises dreaded the ringing phone, fearing it was a call from
Ti-Mel's school reporting another asthma attack. Cases of the
respiratory disease have more than doubled in the past two decades,
to 17.3 million, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. About 5 million are children, with African-American and
inner-city kids hardest hit. For reasons not yet fully understood,
African-American children suffer from asthma at three to four times
the rate of white children, and die from it four times as often.
</P>
<P>
   To put a dent in such statistics, numerous Georgia programs are
knocking on patients' doors, attempting to lessen frantic emergency
room trips, reduce in-patient hospital costs and improve quality of
life. Families are learning that the home _ not the hospital _ is
the place to manage the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Ti-Mel's mother and father said they did not hesitate to rip out
the beige carpeting they had just installed in their modest
three-bedroom home. It probably was adding to Ti-Mel's wheezing and
coughing, said Robin Hyman, a Scottish Rite respiratory therapist
who identified potential asthma triggers last October. Hyman makes
house calls through the Scottish Rite ACE Asthma program, which has
assisted some 3,000 children to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put linoleum all through the house, changed out air
filters, got him a special mattress and pillow covers for his bed
and changed to no-perfume laundry detergent,'' Ti-Mel's mother
said. ``I think it has really helped. His symptoms aren't as bad.
And he's learned to be more consistent with his medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Because rain always worsens Ti-Mel's symptoms, recent deluges
have left his chest tight and caused his usual symptoms: headache,
puffy eyes, wheezing. But overall, says the shy, polite adolescent:
``I'm feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Geddis and her husband both run businesses from their home but
qualify for Medicaid to pay medical bills for Ti-Mel and their four
other children, ages 2 to 14. While she said not all families can
afford home improvements, some of them cost nothing. ``Just
learning to be more conscious of dust and keeping rooms free of
clutter has helped,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That lesson is the core of another Atlanta program, Zap Asthma
Inc., aimed at low-income, inner-city children. Last year, it
trained a dozen community residents to become asthma prevention
outreach health workers in the city's Empowerment Zone. This
cluster of downtown neighborhoods is a federally designated area
eligible for millions of dollars in aid to boost businesses, homes
and other needs; 90 percent of its 50,000 residents are black, some
20,000 live in public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Zap Asthma is run by a 16-member collaboration of HMOs,
government agencies, universities and community groups, with a $2.5
million budget, including in-kind contributions such as CDC staff
and equipment. It is funded with grants from pharmaceutical
companies, Atlanta's six major HMOs and the Empowerment Zone.
</P>
<P>
   It works by linking medical and academic experts with plain old
everyday people who know what's what on their own blocks. And by
getting the bucks from investors with bottom-line concerns. Enter
the much-maligned HMO bean counters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to build a template model for how managed care
companies could better improve the health of a community,'' said
George Atkins of the American Association of Health Plans, the
nation's largest trade group for managed care companies. ``Zap
Asthma is an experiment, and Atlanta is our test tube to reach out
to a larger group of partners than we normally do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people served under Zap are not members of the health
care organizations underwriting the program, said Evonne Yancey of
Kaiser Permanente, Georgia Region. ``All the HMOs had pediatric
asthma programs that were effective, and we thought we could apply
that with this initiative. . . . It may sound like pie in the sky,
but our incentive is to improve lives.'' Kaiser's Asthma Management
Plan reduced asthma hospital admission rates of children in its
Georgia coverage area by 66 percent in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Zap Asthma came together in 1996, when the health plan
association was looking for a significant health problem to battle
in an underserved urban area. When the poorest neighborhoods in
Atlanta were asked to name their biggest health concern, kids'
asthma beat out teen pregnancy, drugs and gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, the CDC wanted to identify a health need
in Atlanta's new Empowerment Zone. Bringing the two together was
the work of Dr. Joyce Essien, a longtime CDC employee who is now
the first director at the Center for Public Health Practice at the
Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC's role in Zap Asthma is to study whether the outreach
and home intervention approach works through a comparison study as
well as loaning out several experts. Hughes Spalding Children's
Hospital of Grady Health Systems provides Zap's medical care. Its
staff hopes the program will ease the burden on the pediatric
asthma emergency room, one of the busiest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's jampacked here 24 hours a day during asthma season, from
fall to April,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Linzer, associate medical
director, as he strolled past beds, breathing apparatus and
cabinets full of steroids, inhalers and the many other devices
needed to ease inflamed lungs.
</P>
<P>
   About 14,000 pediatric asthma-related emergencies come through
Hughes Spalding annually; many are repeat patients who don't
understand preventive care, Linzer said.
</P>
<P>
   It's like breathing through a straw. An elephant sitting on your
chest.
</P>
<P>
   When something as basic as air won't come through his own lungs,
it's no wonder a child's asthma panic triggers a ripple effect
throughout the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't breathe,'' says 13-year-old Carrie Cloud of
Atlanta's Lakewood neighborhood. ``If I have a real bad attack,
I'll be scared and I know I'll have to go to Hughes Spalding
again.'' Carrie figures she's ended up at Hughes Spalding
Children's Hospital some 30 times in the past decade. She was
hospitalized three times last year, one time for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older she's getting, the worse it seems to be for her,''
said mother Janice Cloud. ``I know she hates going down there, so I
know she means it when she tells me, `I got to go.' But it means I
have to miss work because I have to be there for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie enrolled in the Zap Asthma program in 1997. It's designed
for children ages 5 to 12, with a goal of getting 250 to 300
families to participate; about 150 are enrolled so far. ACE and Zap
Asthma use similar approaches to improve the health and daily life
of children and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining ACE Asthma in 1998, Ti-Mel missed so much school
``he was at the hospital more than he was at school,'' his mother
said. ``But his teachers would visit him and he kept up with his
studies. Plus, he's smart,'' she added, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Ti-Mel begins seventh grade at Crawford Long Middle
School. His last semester's report card reflected far fewer
absences than the previous semester. ACE, short for Partnership to
Asthma Center for Education, began two years ago at Scottish Rite
as a way to reduce emergency room visits by educating patients,
parents and their doctors, said Mary Jane Richman, Scottish Rite
pulmonary disease manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time the hospital had looked beyond its own
bricks and mortar here to develop new standards of care in the
community,'' she said. ``We learned doctors were very hungry for
help with asthma education.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital staff taught doctors a new way to reach young asthma
patients and their parents, using an easy-to-understand, hand-size
chart.
</P>
<P>
   The chart lists symptoms, medications, what to do and responses
using colors of green (good response), yellow (fair response) and
red (poor response) and a go-directly-to-the-nearest-emergency-room
signal.
</P>
<P>
   Children learn to think of the warning signs of an impending
asthma episode in these traffic-signal colors. They also use a
baseball-team analogy to relate to medical staff as coaches. A
sample survey of 32 asthma patients enrolled in ACE showed an 85
percent reduction in ER visits and 78 percent decline in hospital
admissions after the first year, Richman said.
</P>
<P>
   Zap Asthma teaches similar disease management strategies and
includes home visits. So far, community outreach worker Thelma
Malone has assessed the Cloud home for possible asthma triggers and
collected a dust sample for the CDC study and a blood sample from
Carrie to see if she has been exposed to secondhand smoke. Malone
has returned for several follow-up visits after hooking Carrie up
with the Hughes Spalding outpatient asthma clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families take control,'' Malone says. ``This is not
designed so I do a lot of hand-holding. They have to learn ways to
better manage it.''
</P>
<P>
   But management often takes a back seat to more pressing needs of
the moment. On average, 50 percent of patients do not show up for
appointments at the asthma clinic, said Dr. Kelvin Holloway,
medical director of Hughes Spalding. ``If their child is not having
an acute flare-up with wheezing and coughing, and something else
comes up, like financial problems, transportation issues or other
sick kids, their child's asthma may not be the priority of the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations of Zap Asthma, such as getting family
members to stop smoking, may sound good in theory, but Empowerment
neighborhoods don't have smoking cessation classes. Zap workers
admit the program is just a beginning, not the final answer. They
can't, for example, give away vacuums or cure the ills of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, mattresses are so deplorable and falling to
pieces that there's no sense in putting (allergy) encasements on
them,'' said Marcia Clark, Zap program director who is on loan from
the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the cramped Zap Asthma offices full of secondhand
file cabinets and well-worn chairs, Malone says she learned about
the power and punch of the disease in just one day at Hughes
Spalding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you are watching a very sick child who just can't
breathe. And you hold your own breath hoping that they make it.
It's one of the experiences you will never forget.

you say? Would you say it's ``healthy''? Would you say you're
getting the right amount of nutrients? If you're not sure, then
take a look at the new Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) coming out
from the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of
Sciences. Some DRIs came out in 1997, some are being published this
year, and some will be available in the future. They should be
complete by 2003. (Kennedy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH

SITE SANTA FE EXHIBITION FEATURES WORKS THAT EMBRACE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE THORSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The activist bent of the third international
Site Santa Fe biennial is apparent the moment one steps through the
doors of this nonprofit art space, housed in a former beer
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Heading up a sprawling multimedia exhibition of 30 artists from
more than 20 countries is a billboard-scale photograph of
Greenpeace activists confronting the nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier, USS Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   At the show's July 8 press conference, the biennial's guest
curator, Rosa Martinez from Barcelona, Spain, didn't mince words
about her criteria for inclusion, asserting: ``Art today has to
interact with the real problems in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has worked on nearly a dozen international
exhibits and projects in the last decade, believes that a biennial
has a different role to play than the standard museum exhibition of
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biennials have to challenge the present, reflect on issues
important to the present day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Looking for a Place,'' the exhibit Martinez has put
together does this, with works that reflect on global
manifestations of racism, sexism, environmental despoliation, and
the physical and psychological displacements effected by
governments and industry.
</P>
<P>
   She also sought pieces that would respond to cultural issues
endemic to Santa Fe. American Indian artist Charlene Teters of the
Spokane Nation created an updated adobe version of the city's Plaza
obelisk, a nineteenth-century monument dedicated to ``the heroes
who died in various battles with savage Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez understands the world and its inhabitants to be
fragile, an idea shared by London-based Palestinian artist Mona
Hatoum.
</P>
<P>
   Spread across the cement floor of one of Site Santa Fe's large
galleries is a world map Hatoum created from clear glass marbles.
The piece is vulnerable to the vibrations and careless feet of
gallery visitors, offering a metaphor for the precariousness of
international relations and a comment on global ecological
interconnectedness.
</P>
<P>
   Determining where one artwork ends and another begins can take
awhile, and the show's very layout expresses Martinez's belief that
we must ``live and negotiate our space with the space of the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   All four walls in the gallery containing Hatoum's map are hung
with artworks, including Miwa Yanagi's surreal color photographs of
trim Japanese elevator girls clad in brightly colored uniforms, and
South African Zwelethu Mthethwa's images of Capetown's ``sacred
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   These are room-sized churches, that the city's poorer residents
have established in their houses and creatively decorated with
newspapers and other materials on hand. Mthethwa extended this idea
into the gallery by covering the wall with sheets of newspaper that
he coated with a thin layer of paint.
</P>
<P>
   On the facing wall are additional Greenpeace photographs,
including the chilling landscape image, ``Blood on the ice from
seal cull, Newfoundland, Canada'' (1981).
</P>
<P>
   Many late-19th-century women (themselves subjected to the
butchery of early gynecology) championed the anti-vivisection
movement. The animal rights component of Greenpeace's actions
continues this tradition of standing up for the powerless, and it
is not so surprising that a woman curator would choose to recognize
these actions as art and also to be drawn to works employing
animals as metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of animal slaughter is reiterated in Cuban Tania
Bruguera's harrowing video, ``Burden of Guilt,'' in which the
artist appears with a slaughtered lamb draped over her body, and in
a series of color photographic images by Bulent Sangar from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Sangar's ``Feast of Sacrifice'' (1997-99) features 10
photographs portraying the slaughter of a lamb in the hills just
outside a big city. High-rises loom in the background; a crowded
highway curves nearby. The contemporary urban setting lends a
surreal cast to this killing in the hills, which the artist staged
to dramatize the displacement caused by urban migration.
</P>
<P>
   Lights, cameras
</P>
<P>
   This past spring, Site Santa Fe presented ``Postmark: An
Abstract Effect,'' an international exhibition of works by 22
abstract artists.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 biennial, in contrast, concentrates on artists who use
images. The preferred media are photography and video;
``sculpture,'' when it appears, is usually incorporated into
installation and site-specific pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most inventive examples of the latter are a series of
up-in-the rafters installations by Francisco Ruiz de Infante of
Spain. Ladders, rising from the gallery floor, indicate their
locations. Viewers must sign a release before ascending to these
hidden gallery aeries, which incorporate air, water, sound, light
and a video projection.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has devoted an entire room to the interactive objects
of the late Brazilian artist Lygia Clark (1920-88). Displayed on
long waist-high tables, rather like a church rummage sale, the more
than two dozen pieces offer quite a good sampling of Clark's
revolutionary output. Selections range from garment works like her
hooded fabric masks incorporating fragrance elements to simple
toylike inventions: an elastic Mobius strip called ``Hand
Dialogue''; a plastic bag filled with water titled ``Draw With Your
Finger.''
</P>
<P>
   A high point of the exhibition is the video installation
``Rapture,'' by Iranian-born artist Shirin Neshat. Last seen
earlier this year at the Art Institute of Chicago, ``Rapture''
continues Neshat's exploration of the repression of Iranian women.
</P>
<P>
   Like her previous video, ``Turbulent,'' the piece employs two
facing projections, one depicting the activities of a group of men,
the other showing women. The work begins with the men tramping
about an old fortress, while the women, clad all in black, gather
in the desert. The ``story'' develops from there, with moments of
great drama and poignance.
</P>
<P>
   Like all big contemporary shows that include works with sound
components, there is a certain amount of din to contend with at
this biennial. Offering a welcome respite from the general level of
visual and aural demands is Brazilian artist Rivane
Neuenschwander's quiet floor piece comprising two pristinely
delineated rectangles created from talcum powder, accented within
by small piles of talc swept into place by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   Room for humor
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's idea of engaged art by no means excludes works of
beauty, humor and whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   All three are present in Danish artist Simone Aaberg Kaern's
video, ``Royal Greenland,'' which shows the tiny, silhouetted
figure of the artist, arms flapping and legs kicking, ``flying''
through the air above the dog-sled teams and ice fishermen of
Greenland's frozen landscape. The infectious rhythms of a
percussive soundtrack heighten the humorous effect.
</P>
<P>
   The very title of Monica Bonvicini's book project, ``What does
your wife//girlfriend think of your rough and dry hands?'' provokes
a smile, for its obvious gender inversion.
</P>
<P>
   The question is one of about a dozen attitude-revealing
inquiries that the Italian artist compiled into a printed
questionnaire, which she then circulated to construction workers in
Germany, Italy and the United States. The completed questionnaires,
with accompanying photographs, make up the book she produced,
copies of which are displayed in the gallery in stacks and cartons.

 &HT;    Providing solutions to problems posed on Net
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not long ago, a gentleman e-mailed me asking where he
could buy a metal detector to inspect his lumber before sawing or
planing it.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt my reply was much help, but I noticed a recent exchange
on the Internet on the matter, and a fellow suggested a ``Security
Wand'' from Radio Shack. He said it is more sensitive to metal than
anything else he tried.
</P>
<P>
   Other short ends and cutoffs from the Net:
</P>
<P>
   A fellow reports that he is, ``working with red oak on my table
saw and I am having a problem when I am straightening the edges (I
don't have a jointer). The wood is burning as I pass it through the
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those questions that doesn't supply complete
information. How is he ``passing it through the saw?'' Is he simply
ripping it or is he, as he should if he's actually jointing on the
table saw, clamping the wood to a sled which runs against the rip
fence or in the miter gauge slot?
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of that information, one can only fall back on
standard advice. There are several things that can cause a saw to
burn the stock, regardless of the type of wood: A dull blade;
feeding too slowly; and pinching caused by misalignment between the
blade and the fence.
</P>
<P>
   To correct this, check the manual for your saw. Generally
speaking, you check first for correct alignment between the blade
and the miter gauge slot. If this is off, it will be necessary to
unbolt the table and adjust it, which isn't as hairy as it sounds,
at least on a good saw. Then you align the fence to the miter
gauge.
</P>
<P>
   Another fellow relates how he went to a friend's house and was
asked if he'd like to see the friend's new woodshop. In it he found
what appeared to him to be substandard equipment, but the friend's
finished work was superb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was dumfounded _ really couldn't believe it,'' he wrote.
``For me, this was one of those profound moments in my life when I
finally understand what I have been told, but didn't fully
appreciate. As much as good tools are important, it is the
craftsman and not the tools.''
</P>
<P>
   I generally cringe when I see this old axiom. It tends to make
newcomers think they can go out and buy worthless tools and still
do good work. Very few, if any, people can learn the craft of
woodworking with bad tools. Those who do have two qualities: they
are infinitely patient, and they are mechanically skilled. They
have the understanding to see what is wrong with the tools they
have, and the knowledge and patience to fix the problems.
</P>
<P>
   I knew an outstanding woodworker who had a Craftsman radial arm
saw. He had spent a lot of time on it, curing a lot of its
problems. But he still had a $1,200 bandsaw to clean up the
mistakes and inadequacies of the radial arm saw.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, don't assume that because a major power tool is
very old and has no fancy fittings that it is inferior. Relatively
inexpensive tools made 35 years ago were far better than their
price equivalents today.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ PARIS _ Jazz is alive and as well as can be

from home for American jazz. Now it's more of a no-man's land.
(Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SATURDAY.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ The outpouring of sorrow at the
news of John Kennedy's death in Dallas in 1963 was understandable
even to his enemies. Kennedy was a tested leader in the midst of a
red-hot cold war. He was a man of considerable personal
accomplishments. For me, the outpouring of sorrow at the news of
the untimely death of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. is less
understandable. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ I caught myself making up
Beanie-Baby names for the people waiting outside the line at the
Rainforest Cafe. This wasn't a great deal of fun, but I had already
lost all my change trying to toss it inside the mechanical
crocodile's mouth. I had to do something. (Latham, Marshall News
Messenger) FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ When we arrived at the
restaurant, my friends were belting out ``On Wisconsin,'' two
white-haired frat boys in a convertible with the top down. Nobody
would have believed they're teetotalers. Several smartly dressed
whippersnappers waiting at valet parking could hardly stifle
snickers when we drove up and began making our way inside on
arthritic knees. ``Weren't you embarrassed?'' my wife wanted to
know when I described the scene that night at supper. Of course I
wasn't embarrassed. I was inspired. (Jim Minter is a former editor
of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ Strange, when you think how large Neil
Armstrong loomed in our consciousness at that time, how little he
is part of this community's consciousness, even though he has lived
among us, a neighbor, for 27 years. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)
MOVED FOR SATURDAY.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-TERMS _ ATLANTA _ For the descendants of American slaves,
a name was always more than just a name. The skin-deep aspects of
their racial identity can be traced like tree rings to the terms
used to describe them. The n-word was supposed to be an insult,
first used like a lash to demean and defeat. Colored, seemed like
an upgrade until it was replaced by ``Afro-American''. To be black
in the late 1960's and 70's was not only beautiful, but
revolutionary as well. Then in 1988 the Rev. Jesse Jackson publicly
urged blacks to stop playing the name game, and to once and for all
declare themselves African-Americans. Some dismissed Jackson's
suggestion as a linguistic fad. Not anymore. (Harris, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Like Little Nell lashed to the railroad tracks
in a silent movie, public television lives a life of constant
danger and narrow escapes. The latest freight train sent rumbling
toward the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was fired up by a
gaffe by several PBS stations. Or was it a gaffe? (Tom Teepen is
national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR
SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ That's the way it goes in the world of
medicine and disease. One well-meaning medical group will make a
pronouncement regarding health and another will shoot holes in it.
So why pay attention? (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News
Service.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Did relentless press coverage arouse
the remarkable wave of interest in the accidental death at an early
age of John F. Kennedy Jr.? Or were the guardians of the media
gates bowing to the popular will by simulating on a summer weekend
the national catharsis that followed his father's assassination on
a warm November day in Dallas 36 years ago? (Andy Glass is a
columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED
THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ PARIS _ Jazz is alive and as well as can be
expected these days. Never mind that Paris was once the home away
from home for American jazz. Now it's more of a no-man's land.
(Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SATURDAY.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ The outpouring of sorrow at the
news of John Kennedy's death in Dallas in 1963 was understandable
even to his enemies. Kennedy was a tested leader in the midst of a
red-hot cold war. He was a man of considerable personal
accomplishments. For me, the outpouring of sorrow at the news of
the untimely death of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. is less
understandable. (Rowland Nethaway is senior editor of the Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ I caught myself making up
Beanie-Baby names for the people waiting outside the line at the
Rainforest Cafe. This wasn't a great deal of fun, but I had already
lost all my change trying to toss it inside the mechanical
crocodile's mouth. I had to do something. (Latham, Marshall News
Messenger) FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ When we arrived at the
restaurant, my friends were belting out ``On Wisconsin,'' two
white-haired frat boys in a convertible with the top down. Nobody
would have believed they're teetotalers. Several smartly dressed
whippersnappers waiting at valet parking could hardly stifle
snickers when we drove up and began making our way inside on
arthritic knees. ``Weren't you embarrassed?'' my wife wanted to
know when I described the scene that night at supper. Of course I
wasn't embarrassed. I was inspired. (Jim Minter is a former editor
of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED FOR SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ Strange, when you think how large Neil
Armstrong loomed in our consciousness at that time, how little he
is part of this community's consciousness, even though he has lived
among us, a neighbor, for 27 years. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)
MOVED FOR SATURDAY.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-TERMS _ ATLANTA _ For the descendants of American slaves,
a name was always more than just a name. The skin-deep aspects of
their racial identity can be traced like tree rings to the terms
used to describe them. The n-word was supposed to be an insult,
first used like a lash to demean and defeat. Colored, seemed like
an upgrade until it was replaced by ``Afro-American''. To be black
in the late 1960's and 70's was not only beautiful, but
revolutionary as well. Then in 1988 the Rev. Jesse Jackson publicly
urged blacks to stop playing the name game, and to once and for all
declare themselves African-Americans. Some dismissed Jackson's
suggestion as a linguistic fad. Not anymore. (Harris, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) FOR SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Like Little Nell lashed to the railroad tracks
in a silent movie, public television lives a life of constant
danger and narrow escapes. The latest freight train sent rumbling
toward the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was fired up by a
gaffe by several PBS stations. Or was it a gaffe? (Tom Teepen is
national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR
SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ That's the way it goes in the world of
medicine and disease. One well-meaning medical group will make a
pronouncement regarding health and another will shoot holes in it.
So why pay attention? (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News
Service.) MOVED THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Did relentless press coverage arouse
the remarkable wave of interest in the accidental death at an early
age of John F. Kennedy Jr.? Or were the guardians of the media
gates bowing to the popular will by simulating on a summer weekend
the national catharsis that followed his father's assassination on
a warm November day in Dallas 36 years ago? (Andy Glass is a
columnist for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED
THURSDAY FOR SUNDAY.

SITE SANTA FE EXHIBITIONFEATURES WORKS THAT EMBRACE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE THORSON  
 c. 199 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (she produced, copies of which are displayed in the gallery in
stacks and cartons.)
</P>
<P>
   Reports of cultural identity crises in the wake of the Soviet
Union's collapse have been greatly under-exaggerated, if one is to
judge from the black-and-white photographs of Arsen Savadov and
Georgy Senchenko.
</P>
<P>
   The Ukrainian duo here shows a series of bizarre, hilarious
images of filthy coal miners in the company of coal-dirtied male
actors attired in frilly but grayed ballet tutus.
</P>
<P>
   For the biennial, the two also created a text installation in
the bathrooms. Cryptic phrases _``for impossibility of actions,''
``for desexualization of production'' and so forth _ appear on the
lavatory mirror, the sinks, the doors of the stalls, even the
toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Savadov and Senchenko also put out an edition of 20,000
postcards featuring photographs of mostly naked men wearing bunny
ears in a lovely sylvan setting. Short texts overlay the images.
</P>
<P>
   The biennial continues outdoors in the form of a lighthouse
created from refuse by Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang that sits atop
the gallery's roof. Sited throughout the grounds are the signs and
wood benches _ cut in half and positioned so that the resulting two
seats face in opposite directions _ of Egyptian artist Ghada Amer.
</P>
<P>
   This is a biennial that doesn't stop _ more artworks are
featured at offsite locations, including the Los Alamos Airport and
San Ildefonso Pueblo, a municipal parking garage and the New Mexico
State Capitol Building.
</P>
<P>
   The American artist team of Diller \P Scofidio have rented Room
120 of the Santa Fe Budget Inn for the exhibit's duration. Inside
they have mounted a series of video cameras _ one aims at a ceiling
stain, another appears in the toilet tank, another tracks a drip of
water at the edge of the bathtub _ whose findings are relayed on
the television at the end of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   From this tacky hotel room to the Ukranian postcards, from
images of slaughtered beasts to the potentially dangerous rooms in
the rafters, this is one ambitious and thought-provoking global
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   If you're ``looking for a place'' where art surprises and ideas
thrive, this show will satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   On exhibit
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``Looking for a Place,'' the third international Site
Santa Fe biennial.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Site Santa Fe, 1606 Paseo de Peralta, Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   When: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays,
Sundays; 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fridays. Closed Mondays and Tuesdays.
The Biennial continues through Dec. 31.
</P>

   How much: $5 for adults; $2.50 for students and seniors. Free on
Fridays.

</P>
<P>
   How do they do it? Money and moxie
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe, N.M., population 50,000, is not a place one would
expect to find a big international exhibition of contemporary art.
But since its founding in 1994, the nonprofit art space Site Santa
Fe has presented three international biennials and more than 20
additional exhibitions highlighting major contemporary art trends
and talents.
</P>
<P>
   The biennials alone have exposed the Santa Fe community to an
astounding number of leading contemporary artists, including Marina
Abramovic, Janine Antoni, Ann Hamilton, Gary Hume, William
Kentridge, Tracey Moffatt, Shirin Neshat, Pipilotti Rist and Sam
Taylor-Wood.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent telephone interview, director Louis Grachos observed
with some pride that ``there are very few international biennials.
The biennial we set up is unique to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Featuring about 30 artists from more than 20 countries and
encompassing roughly a dozen off-site venues, ``Looking for a
Place,'' Site Santa Fe's third biennial, is its biggest so far.
With a price tag of $650,000 _ out of a total fiscal 1999 budget of
$1.9 million _ this third biennial is also the most costly.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors from other, larger cities _ say, Kansas City (where the
art institutions and exhibition spaces all but ignore the existence
of cutting-edge international contemporary art) _ might well
wonder: How does Site Santa Fe do it?
</P>
<P>
   Funding, of course, is key and is derived primarily from private
foundations, board members and a small group of individuals
associated with the founding of Site Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   These include board member John L. Marion, former chairman and
chief auctioneer at Sotheby's (now honorary chairman), and his
wife, Anne, a leading cultural philanthropist from Fort Worth who
also spearheaded the creation of Santa Fe's Georgia O'Keeffe
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Joining and encouraging them were Joann and Gifford Phillips,
part-time New Yorkers who are still active on the boards of the
Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Phillips Collection
(founded by Gifford Phillips' uncle, Duncan Phillips) in
Washington, D.C. Other prime movers and funders include art
collectors Emily Fisher Landau and Bobbie Foshay-Miller, the
current president of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Former Santa Fe art dealer Laura Carpenter generally is credited
as coming up with the idea for Site Santa Fe _ a European
kunsthalle-style forum for international contemporary art that
would focus on exhibitions and not maintain a permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original idea,'' according to Joann Phillips, who just
stepped down as chairman of Site Santa Fe's board after holding the
post for four years, ``was to stick with presenting a major
international show every two years.''
</P>
<P>
   But late in 1995, several months after Site Santa Fe opened in
the former Coors-Maloof beer warehouse, which was renovated into an
art space by Richard Gluckman Architects, the decision was made to
offer year-round programming, with the biennials serving as a major
focus.
</P>
<P>
   Besides exhibitions, roughly 75 percent of which are organized
by Site Santa Fe, the space sponsors lectures and gallery talks,
artist workshops and residencies. It also presents a literary
series, titled ``readings &AMP; conversations,'' sponsored by the
Lannan Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't have the burden of a collection, exhibitions
and programs get the energy,'' Grachos observed. ``We're still very
much an artist-centric organization. Most of our budget gets funn

NO SPECIAL EFFECTS NEEDED FOR THIS SUMMER'S SHOESTRING SCAREFEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an era of bloated, big-budget, high-tech movies, ``The Blair
Witch Project'' is an anomaly _ a homemade scarefest that, says
co-writer and co-director Eduardo Sanchez, ``cost about as much as
a loaded Ford Taurus.''
</P>
<P>
   No big-name stars. No special effects. No gore.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   The little ``Ford Taurus'' made by Sanchez and partner Daniel
Myrick is poised to become a roaring Mack truck. Positive buzz has
been building since it first set hairs on end at the Sundance Film
Festival in January, and a wildly innovative marketing campaign
keeps the anticipation mounting.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ``The Blair Witch Project'' (which opens Friday
at the Tivoli Manor Square) is so simple one wonders why nobody
thought of it before:
</P>
<P>
   Three college film students go into the Maryland woods to make a
documentary about the supernatural happenings that have plagued the
area since colonial times. They never return. A year later their
abandoned equipment is found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' purports to be the film and video
footage shot by the three before they vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``A truly original movie,'' raves the Los Angeles Daily News,
``tapping into primal anxieties while blazing its own unique trail
into the dark and foreboding woods.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Darn scary,'' proclaims the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ``We
leave it feeling strangely unsettled in a way we almost never do
after one of Hollywood's $100 million, special-effects-heavy fright
fests.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason ``Blair Witch'' seems so convincing is that it
appears to be exactly what it says it is: the last testament of
three young people who become lost in the woods and use their
equipment to document their own descent into madness.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the film was shot by the three actors _ Heather
Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard _ who were selected
for their improvisational abilities after nearly a year of casting
by Sanchez and Myrick.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the fascinating part: While they were playing their
roles, the actors were actually living them. Sanchez and Myrick
sent them into the woods unaccompanied and knowing only the basic
outline of the story. There was no rehearsal; the actors were
expected to invent their scenes as they went along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to keep the actors ignorant, so they wouldn't know
any more than their characters did,'' Sanchez said in a recent
telephone conversation. ``They went out there not even knowing how
long they'd be in the woods. We'd leave written instructions marked
with orange flags, giving them just enough information to get
through that day's scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get natural reactions, so we set up surprises.
For the stick-man scene'' _ in which the lost students come across
a clearing in which weird life-size human effigies dangle from the
trees _ ``we gave them the longitude and latitude and told them to
get there by 6 o'clock and look up into the trees. Those were the
only directions they got, and their reactions are genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good acting is tapping into your own fears and emotions,''
added Myrick, who met Sanchez when both were film students at
Florida Central University. ``Our goal was to set a stage that
allowed our cast to tap in a bit deeper than a normal set
environment would allow.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the directors guided the players around the woods via
global positioning technology. A handheld monitor _ the same
equipment commonly used by hunters and campers _ allowed the actors
to easily find their next ``location'' through data supplied by a
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sun went down things got really creepy, with the
directors scrambling around the actors' campsites and playing tapes
of eerie noises (children's voices, screams of pain, the crunches
and crashes of mysterious movements through the brush). The
filmmakers also left ``presents'' _ like the odd pile of stones the
appears overnight at the entrance of the hikers' tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary to be running around the woods at 2 in the
morning, making noises and hauling a backpack full of rocks,''
Myrick recalled. ``There definitely were elements of actual fear
and tension and hunger on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actors were playing people who were sure they were being
watched _ and they were being watched. I was in the woods watching
them in camouflage fatigues.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the `acting'
</P>
<P>
   Each night the actors would drop off their film and video at a
prearranged checkpoint. Sanchez and Myrick would watch the video,
write up directing notes and deposit those under the orange flag to
be picked up by the cast in the morning. The actors weren't allowed
to see one another's notes, so that they would be genuinely
surprised by the other characters' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the eight days they were in the woods filming, the actors
never saw us,'' Sanchez said. ``We had an element of control, sure.
But it was much more flexible for the actors than your conventional
movie set would have been. I think that's why it seems so real.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of filming Sanchez and Myrick had 20 hours of footage
to whittle down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job was to get rid of anything that screamed out `Not
real!''' Myrick said. ``That's why we wanted the actors to handle
the cameras, so there were no clever camera angles. So it would
really look like a student film. We cut out anything that actually
looked like acting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing is that Dan and I aren't even big horror film
fans,'' Sanchez said. ``Basically, this was the best idea we could
come up with for an inexpensive film. We realized early on that we
were taking every weakness of independent film and turning it to
our advantage. Crude camera work is OK in this movie because that's
what you expect from student filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going in, though, we had no idea if it would work. It was a
theory, an experiment. We hoped at the end we'd have some
realistic-looking stuff. It wasn't until well into the shoot that
we started seeing footage and said to each other, `We might have
something here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Though made on a shoestring, ``The Blair Witch Project'' caused
such a sensation at Sundance that Artisan Entertainment bought it
for more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   And, taking a cue from the Sundance audience members who didn't
realize the film was make-believe (some even approached the
filmmakers to demand that the Maryland police reopen the case),
Artisan and the co-directors launched a tongue-in-cheek marketing
campaign that goes along with the joke.
</P>
<P>
   The film's official Web site at www.blairwitch.com traces the
history of the Blair Witch over 200 years (including Death Row
photos of the forest-dwelling hermit who in the 1940s murdered
several children after receiving orders from a mysterious voice).
There's even ``news'' coverage of the police search for the missing
students.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is it stated that the film is fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The deception continued with ``Curse of the Blair Witch,'' which
aired recently on cable's Sci-Fi Channel. Like the film, it
purports to be a documentary featuring interviews with the missing
students' families, friends and teachers, and with Maryland
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Blair Witch' kind of let us go out there and become
filmmakers even though we didn't have many resources,'' Sanchez
said. ``It was the perfect first film because not only was it
inexpensive, it's a one-of-a-kind project that nobody expects us to
repeat. `Blair' just wipes the slate clean and allows us to
reinvent ourselves.''

   Welcome to makeupmania.com, a Web site operated by a group of
Hollywood makeup artists out of Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Move on to eve.com and pick up tips on wearing pink even if you
hate it or choose from among Tony and Tina lipsticks with herbal
ingredients including the mood-lifting St. John's wort. Buy such
brands as Erno Lazlo, Calvin Klein and Urban Decay glitter.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes in the world of cyberspace beauty.
</P>
<P>
   With a few mouse clicks you can bounce around well over a dozen
Web sites offering everything from feel-good soaps and candles to
makeup brushes, vitamin serums and perfume. Some will ship products
within a few days. Others do little more than advertise a product
and retail locations. In either case, it's far more than a product
lineup. At www.lancome.com, for example, you get ``10 tricks for
the perfect makeup'' but no opportunity to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Online beauty is an infant-level marketing industry expected to
grow explosively in the next few months. Several major sites are on
the slate for early fall. And Internet trackers such as the
Boston-based Forrester Research are urging companies to move online
and prepare for the surge.
</P>
<P>
   Online cosmetics are still a very small part _ about 1 percent _
of beauty industry sales. Some estimates put numbers for last year
at $10 million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unknown quantity. ``Everyone is just waiting and
watching to see what happens in September,'' says Dorene Kaplan, an
executive with Beauty Fashion and Cosmetics World magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Katt, a vice president of Estee Lauder Online divisions,
says the two selling sites for Bobbie Brown and Clinique have
reached new customers. But in general, the ``jury is still out as
to what the market holds.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mottus, a veteran New York-based beauty industry
consultant, says the buzz is based on ``big money waved at people''
from venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of money is unbelievable,'' he said. ``I don't know
if the reward at the end of it will be there. But women do have
emotional enjoyment purchasing beauty products.''
</P>
<P>
   Mottus predicts that ``this time next year there will be 50 or
60 sites out there as compared with about 20'' now.
</P>
<P>
   The perfume industry is also ``looking at it,'' says Annette
Green, the president of the New York-based Fragrance Foundation.
``It's just beginning but it's very important,'' she says. Current
best sellers are in the category of ``aromacology'' scents created
to affect your mood (lavender, say, or rosemary).
</P>
<P>
   Convenience is a major draw to online shopping. Ease onto the
Internet at 11 p.m., after a long day at the office, and order
Clinique moisturizer or Bobbie Brown's orange lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is especially enticing if you can't pop over to the
mall on your way home. Katt says a large number of
bobbibrowncosmetics.com customers are people who live at least 20
miles outside a city where Brown is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Go into drugstore.com and get glam-rock glitter powder
reminiscent of ``Velvet Goldmine'' delivered in time for Saturday
night. You can also get the latest hype about new developments in
skin-care treatments and entertain yourself for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Post-Holmes, a facialist at Ghianni Day Spa in Kansas
City, says she turned to the Internet for research and ultimately
began ordering some of her oils.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites such as makeupmania.com sell only private-label
products. Brand names such as Calvin Klein, Erno Lazlo, Benefit and
Urban Decay are easily accessible at other sites.
</P>
<P>
   What net retailers also tout, especially for the future, is
personalized service. The next generation of e-commerce sites
probably will have highly sophisticated mechanisms to analyze
consumer data. Such factors as skin tone, eye color, skin type and
purchasing patterns will enable sites to quickly dish up
suggestions and samples keyed to an individual's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hamer, the CEO of www.beautyscene.com, a sprawling new Web
site scheduled for a late-August opening, says 60 percent will be
devoted to personalized services and 40 percent to general product
sales.
</P>
<P>
   At ibeauty.com, scheduled for late-August launch, you will have
a virtual makeover by creating what you think you look like.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature is free samples, which companies see as a way to
hold down returns.
</P>
<P>
   Lonely shoppers?
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, you don't touch, feel or sample products. As
Victoria Moran, a Kansas City-based author says, ``Wouldn't you
miss going into the store and smelling all those smells?''
</P>
<P>
   Mottus sees such shopping as a lonely effort. ``For young women
who work hard, it's a convenience. But don't we spend enough time
by ourselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Technology breakdowns are another challenge. When you need that
lipstick or moisturizer, you may not be able to access the site.
Color displays aren't always clear, and just try to figure out if,
say, Vincent Longo's ``magnolia'' red lip color on eve.com will go
with your new pink blouse.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is daunting Hamer of beautyscene.com, who comes from
a Wall Street financial background. E-commerce, ``having captured
every industry _ no industry has not been affected by it''_ is
certain to have an impact on the beauty business, he says. ``There
is such a potential for growth. ... It's an untapped market.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the first 12 months he expects to make about $20 million
in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Hamer's site cost more than $1 million, and he has targeted $20
million to $40 million for marketing in the next 12 to 18 months.
But the advantage in getting in early makes the campaign a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In three to four years, the costs will be $400 to $500
million. It's going to grow that fast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The target consumer here is the professional woman between about
21 and 34 years old. The younger Y generation, raised with the
computer, also is expected to catch on to the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   But men are also a ripe consumer group for grooming and
fragrance products. They may be more comfortable shopping online
than in traditional department or specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   Other upcoming sites in September include the French-based
Sephora, a chain of trendy, spacious cosmetics stores known for
hands-on sampling for its own line and most other major brands. The
company is owned by the wealthy French company LVMH Louis Vuitton
Moet Hennessey, the parent company of Christian Dior, among others.
The company recently declared the goal is to be the Amazon.com
(booksellers) of cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   As for ibeauty.com, the site has contracted for more than 250
fragrances and 300 beauty products from names such as Jil Sander,
Tommy Hilfiger, Phyto and Elizabeth Arden.
</P>
<P>
   With an editor and executive editor as a magazine would have,
the site is hooking into the New York fashion events and plans to
go backstage during the September runway shows. A contest will
award the winner with a trip to the shows.
</P>
<P>
   The projected revenue is triple the $10 million Internet sales
from last year, says Cary Goretsky, a public relations spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Jasmine.com, which goes up early next month, will market only
upscale fragrances such as Chanel and Hugo Boss. The site features
a museum of perfume bottles and a history of some classic
fragrances. CEO Dale Dewey says he wants it to be the ``Bergdorf
Goodman of the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the bar for online beauty sites is being raised as big
business moves out there. A Web site is no small investment. Prices
can run from $100,000 to more than a $1 million, and once up, it
must be constantly updated, says Rebecca Buntin, director of
marketing and sales for Cephas Multimedia Inc. in Kansas City,
whose clients include high-end apparel sites.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the big-money giants coming onto the playing field,
there are still small cottage-like companies who fall back on the
telephones to help customers work through problems. One is
beautycafe.com, run by two women in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
``We are moms with children and pets,'' says Connie Badzwion. She
joined up with Lisa Slavik, a graphics artist, two years ago
because ``we always loved makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   They have seen the growth go ``beyond the businesswoman sitting
at her desk to the busy mom'' and a surprising number of male
customers, she says. And their overhead is relatively low because
Slavik designed the site and updates it regularly. ``When something
is new we can have it out there within the hour,'' Badzwion says.
</P>
<P>
   The future may be hazy for online beauty but certainly will
pressure traditional retailers to spiff up their appeal. ``The
inefficient retailer or nonpleasurable retailers are going to
lose,'' Mottus says.

WOODSTOCK ORIGINALS CYNICAL ABOUT '99 EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Artist Arlo Guthrie barely remembers it.
Promoter Artie Kornfeld remembers, but gave away all his
remembrances. And Nansi Nevins is merely unremembered.
</P>
<P>
   All were part of a signature moment of a generation during
arguably the nation's most remarkable summer. And 30 years after
the Woodstock nation gathered in Bethel, N.Y., the three were
reunited on a stage and in opposition to the use of the Woodstock
name in anniversary concerts, including this weekend's 30th
anniversary event in another New York town, Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodstock II and III, I sort of cringe,'' Kornfeld said.
Later, he added: ``I resent the way they are using the name
Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   The three gathered for the summer Television Critics Association
press tour last week with another Woodstock icon, upstate New York
hog farmer Wavy Gravy, to promote an upcoming VH1 documentary and
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie said he didn't really recall much from the August 1969
concert until a few years ago: ``My youngest daughter came back
from school one day and said, `Hey, dad, were you really at
Woodstock?' And I said, `Yeah, I think so.'''
</P>
<P>
   He then saw the movie. It helped.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of memory, Guthrie said he refuses to recognize the
later versions of the original show as being part of the Woodstock
franchise. In fact, he refuses to acknowledge Woodstock could be a
franchise, as opposed to a singular, organic moment in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there have been other Woodstocks,'' Guthrie
said. ``I mean, there have been attempts to make other concerts and
call it Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those moments that is rare in the history of the
world, when you have a historic event that is known to be historic
at the same time when you're in the midst of it,'' he continued.
``It doesn't happen very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nevins agreed. Back then she was Nansi Nevins, the lead
singer of Sweetwater, the band that kicked off the concert but was
derailed months later on the way to stardom by an automobile
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Also on board the anti-Woodstock III bandwagon was a singer who
was not at Woodstock, but who did appear at the Monterey Pop
Festival, second only to Bethel in terms of '60s lore: Michelle
Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say arbitrarily you are going to have another
(Woodstock),'' said Phillips, who will play Nevins in an upcoming
VH1 movie titled ``Sweetwater'' (Aug. 15, 9 p.m.). ``You are not
going to be able to re-create it and have the same passion and the
same kind of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Wavy doesn't have a problem with promoter Michael Lang
continuing to use the Woodstock name. The former hog farmer and
emcee is also getting paid to show up at the closed Griffiss Air
Force Base in Rome for the show, which runs through Sunday. He also
doesn't acknowledge the contradiction of using the name of a
gathering that was supposed to represent peace and love for a
concert at a former military base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can irony that out,'' Gravy said. ``If anybody needs peace
and love, it's former or current military installations. These
places need to be neutralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her objections to the use of the name, Nevins had advice
for those planning to go to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it with love,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sunscreen,'' Gravy added.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what you think about Woodstock III, it doesn't hurt to
listen to experience.

 A burial at sea made perfect sense  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Rhonda Chriss Lokeman  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   His old man had spoken often of the sea.
And so to the sea went the young man, ashen and blessed, in the
company of his beautiful young wife and her sister. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scattered to the winds from the deck of a U.S. naval vessel, the
remains of John F. Kennedy Jr. and the sisters Bessette went to
their watery grave. Their grief-stricken families once more were
made by circumstance to meet tragedy with grace, poise and an
unnatural stoicism that has become part of the Kennedy lore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was what young John wanted, it was said: to be wind swept
after death off the shores of Martha's Vineyard, near the
Massachusetts estate bequeathed to him and sister Caroline by their
widowed mother. To be sown over the waves near where he kayaked and
set sail with cousins for competitive boat races near Hyannis
Port. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A burial at sea. Yes, of course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier talk of a possible waiver for burial at Arlington
National Cemetery, the shrine where his president-father's grave is
marked with an eternal flame, was pure speculation on the part of
know-nothings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would he be permitted to join his father at the national shrine
where burial space for those who had served in the armed services,
which young John had not, was in short supply? Would the prominent
Democratic family exercise its clout and call upon the Clinton
administration for a special favor for young John? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long ago John Jr. had made known to his family how he wanted to
be put to rest, it was said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A burial at sea. It made perfect sense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A burial at sea also meant no visitation, no lingering by
well-intended strangers such as those who in the days before the
search-and-rescue mission turned to search-and-recovery, had camped
outside his New York residence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such a burial meant no one would bother him, his wife and her
sister in their final resting place, the majestic Atlantic. Few
could visit a grave that shifted with the tide, that failed to
resist the lunar pull, that, like the waters themselves, seemed to
ebb and flow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was a man who, despite being passed the torch of princely
prominence, guarded his privacy and even more fiercely his wife's.
Even so, the couple was hounded by paparazzi. He once remarked that
he felt more like Princess Di than John Quincy Adams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A burial at sea. Yes, indeed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Young John couldn't have known then, when the lawyer-publisher
made this conscious choice, that he would be returned to the depths
from which his body, and the bodies of his wife and sister-in-law
would be pulled. The first sign of disaster were personal
possessions that washed ashore: Lauren Bessette's calling card. A
prescription medicine bottle said to belong to Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that the single-engine plane John Jr. piloted
veered suddenly and awkwardly to the right, away from his vineyard
destination, and took a merciless nosedive into Neptune's nocturnal
embrace some 116 feet underwater. Mercifully, all died instantly
and on impact, said the coroner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His father was known as the hero of PT-109, the patrol-torpedo
boat that he commanded in the Pacific during World War II. From
this sinking vessel the old man, who later would become America's
35th president, is said to have rescued several crewmen. The old
man knew water's promise and peril. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He had said in 1962 at a dinner in honor of the America's Cup
yacht race: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know why it is that all of us are so committed
to the seaI think it's because we all came from the sea. And it is
an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the
exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the
ocean. And therefore we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in
our tears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We are tied to the ocean and when we go back to the sea _
whether it is to sail or to watch it _ we are going back from
whence we came.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back whence he came, this son of John and Jacqueline. Back
whence he came, this son of the old man who loved the sea and who
in his lifetime became quite fond of it himself. &QL;

HOT SUMMERS PRODUCE MORE BABY BOYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   If the summer brings unusually hot spells, look out for a boom
in baby boys next spring. According to a scientist in Germany, boys
are more likely to be conceived just after a heat wave, while
conception after a cold spell favors girls.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have long suspected that there are seasonal
variations in the ratio of boys to girls born in any population.
Alexander Lerchl of the University of Munster reported last year
that more boys are born in Germany between April and June, and
significantly fewer in October. Experiments with rats and bats had
hinted that environmental temperatures could affect the sex ratio
of offspring. Lerchl hoped to find out whether this is also true
for people.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at average monthly temperatures in Germany between
1946 and 1995, using data sets from the National Climatic Data
Center in Asheville, N.C. He also calculated which months were
unseasonably cold or hot. Then, using German birth records from the
same 50-year period, he looked to see if there were any
correlations between air temperature and the sex ratios of babies
born.
</P>
<P>
   Sex ratio seemed to correlate with temperature about one month
before conception. Hot summers or unseasonably warm patches during
this period yielded more boys, while unusually cold weather favored
girls. Temperature deviations of just a few degrees centigrade had
an impact.
</P>
<P>
   The timing suggests temperature may affect processes within the
testes, Lerchl says (Naturwissenschaften, vol 86, p 340).
Temperature seems to play its part when the father-to-be's sperm
start maturing. Lerchl speculates that hot spells may damage sperm
carrying an X chromosome more than sperm carrying a Y, so more boys
are conceived.
</P>
<P>
   The finding doesn't mean that people from hot climates have a
disproportionate number of sons. While the skin temperature of the
scrotum varies with the season, it doesn't vary greatly between one
place and another because people adapt their clothing to the
climate. ``And the scrotum has the highest density of sweat glands
and the highest capacity to cool,'' says Lerchl.
</P>
<P>
   But the sex bias, although small, could have large-scale
consequences. Lerchl speculates that global warming might further
increase the ratio of males to females, which already favors boys
by a few percent.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also possible that the effect of temperature is
indirect and that balmy weather just makes people have more sex.
Frequent sex increases a woman's chance of conceiving as soon as
she ovulates. This produces more sons, possibly because sperm
carrying a Y chromosome are faster though less robust than
X-carriers, which stand a better chance if they have to wait for
ovulation. &QL;

<P>
   Observing the social niceties of the conference scene can be
difficult enough for human delegates. But this week the people
organizing the annual meeting of the American Association for
Artificial Intelligence in Orlando, Fl., want robots to rise to
this challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In a novel competition, robots are having to overcome the same
hurdles that face anyone who attends the Orlando meeting. They are
dropped outside the conference hotel, and have to ask people for
directions or follow an array of signs to the registration desk.
Having checked in, they are given a map showing the way to a room
in which they have to give a short presentation.
</P>
<P>
   To make the challenge even more realistic, the robots can score
extra points if they spot a distinguished researcher and strike up
a conversation with them. ''The more you can be like a human, the
more points you get,'' says Karen Zita Haigh of the Honeywell
Technology Center in Minneapolis, one of the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Points will also be awarded for successfully negotiating
obstacles including elevators, and ignoring diversions such as
other robots attempting to offer hors d'oeuvres, or conference
officials asking them to ''volunteer'' to help out with a menial
task, such as delivering a note.
</P>
<P>
   Another judge, Alan Schultz of the Naval Research Laboratory in
Washington, D.C., admits that the challenge is ambitious. He
predicts that it could be 10 years before robots attending the
annual meeting have honed their conference schmoozing skills to an
acceptable level.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams were brave enough to take up the challenge this
year _ and they seem to have ignored the spirit of the competition
by making their robots as rude as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Office Boy 2000, entered by the Robotics Institute at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, is a sonar-guided wheelie bin that
throws a tantrum to get people's attention, spinning around and
screaming. It then asks for help, which Good Samaritans are
expected to provide by typing in instructions. Illah Nourbakhsh,
who oversaw the project, says that Office Boy 2000 does not even
attempt to be autonomous: it just keeps asking questions until it

   The other entry comprises four robots from the University of
Southern California's Robotics Research Laboratories. They possess
laser finders to help them avoid hazards in the environment and
take their personas from the notoriously offensive characters in
the cult animated TV series South Park. Kenny, Stan, Cartman and
Kyle push their way through crowds while demanding directions.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz admits this isn't exactly what was intended, but the
robots' brusque approach is within the rules. ''It's just as if a
robot were to persuade a human to pick it up and carry it to the
conference room,'' he says. ''That would be acceptable _ odd, but
acceptable.'' &QL;

   An ingenious device that uses the energy from typing on a
laptop's keyboard to recharge the battery has been patented by
Compaq. The keyboard generator could reduce the size of batteries
or make them last longer.
</P>
<P>
   The generator was invented by Adrian Crisan, who works at
Compaq's Houston headquarters. The shaft of each key has tiny
permanent magnets attached to it, and each shaft is surrounded by
wire coils. Every time a key is depressed, the magnets move through
the coils, inducing a tiny current that is used to charge a
capacitor. When the capacitor has a high enough charge, it
recharges the battery.
</P>
<P>
   The magnets, coils and charging mechanism will add to the cost
and weight of a computer, but Crisan believes time and trends are
on his side: ''Displays, disc drives and other components in
portables keep getting more power-efficient, and consumers are
willing to pay for longer battery life,'' he says. ''We will not
know the economics of this keyboard until it is produced, but it
could mean a 1-kilogram notebook instead of a 1.5-kilogram machine,
or one that would last 10 hours on one charge, as long as you keep
typing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most keyboards have springs to return keys to their original
positions after they're struck. Crisan says that his generator
should not significantly change their feel. ''The magnets weigh a
fraction of a gram each, and the conversion of kinetic to
electrical energy shouldn't add any noticeable resistance compared
to the return springs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Inventing such devices is just a sideline for Crisan. Although
the three Compaq patents that bear his name are for improvements in
hardware, he is actually a software engineer. &QL;

   LSD turns up in a woman's urine sample. If this was one of the
increasingly common workplace drugs tests, she'd probably be out of
job. But the woman is an 82-year-old intensive care patient who had
never taken LSD in her life. The only fun she had was taking
ambroxol, an over-the-counter medicine, which in addition to
clearing mucus from her lungs, caused the bogus test result.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs tests are supposed to be a fast and accurate way for
employers to spot workers who are indulging in illicit thrills. But
mounting evidence suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after ''finding LSD'' in the 82-year-old woman's
urine by serendipity, the same German researchers uncovered 11
other false positives for the drug following urine tests of a kind
widely used in German drugs screening labs.
</P>
<P>
   This is disturbing, since drug testing is a growth industry.
According to Lewis Maltby, director of the American Civil Liberties
Union's workplace rights office, 80 percent of large U.S. companies
now test their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and Europe are catching on. The British government's
Forensic Science Service is coy about the number of British
companies paying for its drug-testing service, but a spokeswoman
said that ''demand is growing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the question marks over reliability, it is unclear
whether companies are harmed by drug use or even whether testing
employees actually helps business.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent survey from the U.S. National Institute on Drug
Abuse (NIDA) estimated that drug misuse by employees cost the
country $142 billion in lost productivity in 1992, and their
employers had to pay twice as much in medical and compensation
claims as for their drug-free colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, researchers from Le Moyne College's Institute of
Industrial Relations in Syracuse, N.Y., examined the productivity
of 63 high-tech firms and found that companies testing workers were
less productive than firms which trusted their staff to be
''clean.'' The reasons are unclear, but testing is time-consuming
and expensive, and can undermine the morale and loyalty of staff.
And some workers may even use drugs to boost their performance, the
researchers say.
 &UR; Private lives &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups are quick to point out that the tests may
identify substances at insignificant doses because of recreational
drug use outside working hours and that such activity has no
bearing on their performance as employees.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Tudor, policy officer of the British Trades Union Congress
says: ''We're very concerned there is a creeping intrusion into
people's private lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fears haven't deterred American society from embracing the
drugs testing culture, and tying itself in some legal knots in the
process. For example, in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that a
Georgia law requiring political candidates to be drug tested
violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable
searches.
</P>
<P>
   But in March last year, the same court upheld the legality of
compulsory random drugs tests for White House employees, presumably
to assure the president is not served by drug-addled interns or
worse, senior advisers under the influence of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to recognize the distinction between tests
applied to public workers and the tests carried out by private
companies, says Marilyn Huestis, acting chief of NIDA's drug
metabolism programs. Federal employees working in sensitive
departments, the military, and those covered by transport
regulations routinely have their urine tested for five key drugs _
marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines _ including ''speed'' _
and PCP, the hallucinogen known as ''angel dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-odd labs certified by the Substance Abuse Mental Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA), which has responsibility for
federal testing standards, perform the tests on samples kept under
strictly controlled conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Samples that come up positive are double checked by a gas
chromatograph mass spectrometer, the ''gold standard'' test that
identifies a substance's exact molecular structure. A doctor then
reviews the findings.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, some private employers work to lower standards.
While some do follow SAMHSA procedures and use federal
laboratories, others use poorly trained staff and commercial drug
testing kits to perform onsite tests that are never confirmed, says
Huestis. ''You go from one extreme to the other,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on the company and the laws of the particular
state.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Howard Taylor, director of laboratory
services at the U.S. National Safety Alliance, a firm which runs
drugs testing programs for over 5000 companies, tested five
commonly used commercial kits for testing urine samples on site.
All the manufacturers claimed their tests were as accurate as any
done in a lab.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what Taylor found. ''The results indicated
discrepancies between claims and performance for all products,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers may regard the SAMHSA cut-off levels to be as
redundant as workers with even the minutest amounts of an illegal
drug in their system. But what if someone tests positive without
taking any illegal substances?
</P>
<P>
   It can happen _ just by eating lunch. In 1997, Judith Bonicamp
and Ida Santana, chemists at Middle Tennessee State University,
Murfreesboro, showed that poppy seed dressings contain enough
opiates to make you test positive for morphine.
</P>
<P>
   The problems associated with urine testing have sparked interest
in alternative techniques, mainly hair, sweat and saliva testing,
says Huestis. Proponents of hair testing argue that it is less
invasive and offers a much larger window of detection, as drugs
stay in hair long after they have been metabolized by the body.
</P>
<P>
   But hair testing is controversial too, mainly because natural
hair color can affect the amount of drug detected. Edward Cone, now
retired from NIDA, found that significantly more cocaine binds to
the very dark hair of male Afro-Americans than to hair of other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   SAMHSA's Drug Testing Advisory Board is looking at whether hair,
sweat or saliva tests could be appropriate for federal test
programs. Each may prove to be faster, cheaper and more sensitive
than current methods. But they come with their own problems, and
the Board is trying to draw up stringent guidelines to govern their
use.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the tests used, civil rights groups remain
concerned. ''Of course we want employees to come to work sober,''
says Maltby of the American Civil Liberties Union. ''But private
companies that indiscriminately test are inevitably going to fire
innocent people.'' &QL;

DROP DEAD STUPID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sure, blacks, Asians, lesbians, the disabled and physically
unattractive have it bad in American movies, but no one's got it
worse than poor white folks.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrated by the relentlessly defective ``Drop Dead
Gorgeous,'' they live in a perpetual state of harassment, and with
no populist visionaries of poor white cinema in sight, things can
get only worse.
</P>
<P>
   Harmony Korine and Alexander Payne are chroniclers of the
ever-present white underclass, but the former's kaleidoscopic
poeticizing and the latter's subtle wickedness are hardly
mainstream approaches to the problem. With once-jagged
ex-trailer-park beauties such as Patricia Arquette and Juliette
Lewis all scrubbed up and successful, a significant portion of the
whites-in-poverty diaspora has been misconstrued as rags-to-riches
social climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' is a mockumentary that hounds the phony
Minnesota town of Mount Rose as it gears up to send one of its own
to the 50th American Teen Princess pageant. It should be renamed
``Drop Dead Ghetto'' and hauled off to the ``Jerry Springer'' hall
of shame. Mount Rose is one of those Midwest towns riven by a
right-side/wrong-side-of-the-tracks mentality where no one has any
class, but everyone's got agrarian, vo-tech or car-sales dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But screenwriter Lona Williams is looking for laughs in the most
obvious places _ a teen beauty pageant, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the girls in town want to make it to the national
pageant, but because this is a movie with a couple of name-brand
stars, only two view winning the crown as their divine right. The
other girls are foils, joke and sight-gag fodder designed to make
Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst) and Becky Leeman (Denise Richards)
seem dimensional, and by comparison they are. But every type of
girl enters the pageant, and because we are in The Heartland _
Mount Rose subsists just beyond the Mall of America's shadow _ each
is redeemed only by how stupid and/or eccentric they are.
</P>
<P>
   There's the hearing girl who longs to be deaf, the cheerleader
whose talent is being a sexed-up slut and the white girl adopted by
a family of Japanese Yankee-philes. There's also the town ``'tard''
(Micheal McShane), an obese man-boy _ straight from Farrely's
Central Casting _ who drools, slaps himself dumb and sprints into
glass, or the town pedophile (Mike Malloy), that chain-smoking,
vertically challenged guy who totes an 8mm camera and has a guilty
tic that shouts, ``I like 'em young!''
</P>
<P>
   The film's most drop-dead hysterical moment comes at the expense
of the reigning Mount Rose Teen Princess. Her victory has rendered
her anorexic, so when she returns to the pageant it's in a wig and
a wheelchair, from which her frail, over-maquillaged face eeks out
a lip sync of ``Don't Cry Out Loud.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few sequences in which the film's snideness is
aligned with a sense of surprising pathos that doesn't seem like a
retread of elements ripped from other movies _ which, from ``The
Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas
Cheerleader-Murdering Mom'' and ``Fargo'' to ``Smile'' and
``Showgirls,'' is precisely what ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' amounts to.
</P>
<P>
   On the pages of Williams' script, a lot more of this might have
been funny, but director Michael Patrick Jann is hellbent on
forcing it all over the top, especially in his encouragement of
laugh-thirsty actors Ellen Barkin, Sam McMurray and Kirstie Alley,
who at her worst can suck the must-see from any TV.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it's the girls who resist the burlesque showboating their
grown-up co-stars can't seem to resist. Only professional
scene-thief Allison Janney (``The Object of My Affection,''
``Celebrity''), as Barkin's trailer-trash gal-pal, has the good,
less-is-more sense God gave a middle-aged woman.
</P>
<P>
   Jann also founded MTV's defunct sketch comedy gas, ``The
State,'' one of the best in this decade's sketch-comedy boon. That
show's smart pacing and arbitrary, acerbic vision have disappeared
from Jann's M.O. here _ this is just sketchy as it slums
mercilessly in low-class cheap shots. It's enough to make you long
for that Harmony Korine Jon Benet telefilm.

`INSPECTOR GADGET': GO TO THE PARK INSTEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' is a downright dumb movie that, with its
breathless pace, lack of character development and uninventive
gags, might be torture for even the kids to sit through _ although,
at 80 minutes, it's a short ride.
</P>
<P>
   And, anyway, if it's aimed at kids, why is the biggest laugh in
the movie a joke about a guy injuring his midsection?
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? See ``Phantom Menace'' again? At least it had
some positive messages for the young'uns. Or a second viewing of
``Tarzan,'' the only truly good offering this summer for children?
</P>
<P>
   See you at the park. Because although ``Tarzan'' is indicative
of a decade-long Disney resurgence in its animated films,
``Inspector Gadget'' is an example of the studio's live-action
collapse (or is ``Wild America'' your idea of entertainment?).
</P>
<P>
   Remember when live-action Disney was fun? Who can resist the
giddy plots and by-the-numbers-yet-winning character development in
``The Computer Who Wore Tennis Shoes,'' ``The Shaggy Dog'' and even
``Escape From Witch Mountain''?
</P>
<P>
   Heck, even Herbie the Love Bug and the lovable field-goal
kicker, Gus the mule, had more character than Matthew Broderick
displays as Inspector Gadget.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the NBC animated television series of the early 1980s,
when the voice of Gagdet was Don Adams, ``Inspector Gadget'' begins
when Claw (Rupert Everett, who in going from ideal husband to ideal
villain is very good) engineers a break-in at a lab in which a
scientist is killed and secrets stolen _ and where our hapless hero
is a security guard. He's badly injured, near death, and is put
back together by the scientist's beautiful young daughter, Brenda
(Joely Fisher).
</P>
<P>
   Sort of a $6 million man for kids, Gagdet has an arsenal of
silly toys that pop out of his body when he invokes the mantra
``Go-go Gagdet'' then the name of the contraption he wishes to
utilize (helicopter, oil slick, etc.). And he's outfitted with a
car that drives itself, speaks with the voice of comic D.J. Hughley
(the only black presence in the movie), and spurts out Skittles and
other forms of product placement in addition to an array of
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Gadget is attached to the city's police department and touted as
a new super weapon. But the police chief (Dabney Coleman) is
jealous of Gadget and assigns him to the ``Kitten Rescue Patrol.''
Of course, he's a source of humor to the real police officers (and
for the audience, the source of humor is kittens who burp. Har,
har).
</P>
<P>
   Gadget gets his first break when Claw, jealous of Gadget's
gagdets, builds his own, evil Gagdet, which he unleashes upon the
city to wreak havoc. Gadget has to find and defeat the double and
Claw to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it makes no sense that Claw would ever feel
threatened enough by Gagdet to go to all that trouble to create a
duplicate. As a rescuer of kittens, he's in no position to foil
Claw's evil plans.
</P>
<P>
   But making sense is not the point of ``Inspector Gadget.'' It's
the feature debut for director David Kellogg, who has made a bundle
shooting commercials for Nike and Fuji, among others. With its
never-let-up pace, stale references to other movies, lack of plot
or good characters and voluminous product placement, ``Inspector
Gadget'' feels like an 80-minute TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   So why would you pay $5 _ or $8 _ a pop to see a commercial?

SILENCE FROM VINEYARD SOUND IS GOLDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to burial and mourning, the
Kennedys know how to do it right. It's a sad fact but truer than
ever this week, the week the news media overdid it.
</P>
<P>
   The burial at sea of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn
Bessette, and her sister Lauren was as eloquent and elegant as that
single drum and riderless horse. All the more so, because all we
saw was a ship at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Those who complain that John F. Kennedy Jr. didn't deserve a
burial at sea should consider not only his father or his
nation-uniting military gesture at the age of 3.
</P>
<P>
   They should consider the stillness of Vineyard Sound on
Thursday, and the Kennedy family's victory at sea over the
paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   The media armada was kept more than a mile away from the
destroyer USS Briscoe and the grieving family scattering ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft were ordered to stay out of an area 5 miles in radius,
and infinity in altitude.
</P>
<P>
   An infinity in altitude. That's a wonderful concept.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of helicopters that chattered over O.J.'s mansion in
Brentwood were silenced. That, alone, is a national service.
</P>
<P>
   One of the photographers at the Coast Guard base in Woods Hole,
Mass., was David Ryan of the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan captured an image that served to end a week of endless,
pointless and sometimes grotesque talk. In Ryan's photograph, four
young Kennedy men and two Coast Guardsmen were loading a casket
into a van.
</P>
<P>
   As so often before, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy was in the middle,
the survivor in charge.
</P>
<P>
   All the eyes of these handsome men were downcast. The photo
showed a real family. The men were not royalty, not the subject of
some curse, not a family to be forever invested with meaning and
psychoanalyzed beyond death.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, like the burial at sea, was eloquent and
elegant, and it ran in morning papers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran it across the top of the front page, under the headline
`Home from the sea,''' said the Boston Globe's director of
photography, Peter Southwick. ``We've been trying very hard to be
respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   His newspaper has not bought any pictures of Caroline Kennedy
taken through bushes, or communion Masses taken with telephoto
lenses. ``Our feeling was that these people have earned their place
in America,'' Southwick said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys earned the service on the destroyer Briscoe, the
long Coast Guard search, the brave work of Navy divers and the
courtesy that so many public officials and members of the media
displayed on Cape Cod this past week.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who complains about the waste of taxpayers' money in the
search and recovery operations hasn't been paying attention to real
wastes of taxpayer money. Those people are just barroom gas bags
and talk-show blowhards, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they'd prefer to have left the wreckage 30 fathoms down,
so it could have been filmed for cheesy TV shows and stripped for
gruesome souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they're just Kennedy haters, but don't have the guts to
say so at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they're simply sick of hearing all the maudlin Kennedy
coverage. I wouldn't blame them for that.
</P>
<P>
   For days now, I've been looking up from my desk at the
television screen to see the ocean and one ship or another. CNN and
MSNBC have been at sea, in both senses, and I was getting seasick.
</P>
<P>
   I've only listened to a little of the bulkhead-to-bulkhead
Kennedy coverage, but TV-watching friends tell me the media have
discovered new depths. This is not 1963, when Walter Cronkite
simply lowered his glasses at the bad news from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   There have been discussions of night flying, Catholic doctrine
about cremation and burial at sea, and even a seminar by a medical
examiner (not from Cape Cod) about the condition of crash and
drowning victims.
</P>
<P>
   Things have been so bad on TV this week that Oliver North had
the high ground, criticizing the media for ``feeding the prurient
interest of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than that, though. The media have been feeding the
Kennedy interest of the American people, and that interest is
almost inseparable from mourning. It represents real feeling, not
simply Americans' lack of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that photograph of the Kennedy family at the Coast Guard
base, there's not much left to say, but I'll try.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys, the Navy and the perpetually under-funded Coast
Guard made me proud. Twenty-four hours after finding the wreckage,
they recovered the bodies, got them home from the sea and gave them
back.
</P>
<P>
   We can turn off the TVs and quit the talk.

PUBLIC SERVANTS AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Just in case you didn't wake up mad enough this
morning, here's another little story about government at work.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Green lives in the Albany suburb of Clifton Park. She
has a boyfriend named Bobby Ray, a mason. He has a friend and
co-worker named Bill Murray. Murray has a house that he rents out.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Murray had some tenants move out. They left a
junk car. It sat there for three years. Finally, Murray asked Ray
if he would like the car.
</P>
<P>
   Ray asked his girlfriend if she wanted it. The car was a 1965
Mustang fastback coupe, burgundy, with a 289 V-8. Green said, yeah,
sure, I would love that car.
</P>
<P>
   So, Ray and Green started fixing up the old Mustang. Green knew
that these cars, in good shape, can be worth some money if you
restore them to prime condition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she wanted to register the car. She went to the New
York Department of Motor Vehicles. She told DMV the story. DMV
said, well, there's no title on this thing. We didn't issue titles
until 1973. So, DMV instructed, just send a
return-receipt-requested to the people who last had it registered.
If the letter comes back as undeliverable, bring it to us, and
we'll register the car for you.
</P>
<P>
   Green sent a letter to Murray's rental house, the last address
she had for the previous owners of the Mustang. When the letter
came back, she registered the car. After investing more than $5,000
in it, the old Mustang was converted into a glittering showpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Which was when Green got a call from DMV's auto theft bureau on
Central Avenue in Albany. Bring the car down here, DMV instructed.
</P>
<P>
   They were extremely nasty to her, she said. They locked her in a
room and said she couldn't leave. They grilled her. Murray, who
also appeared at DMV, said they treated him like a crook.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, DMV let Green go, but they impounded the Mustang.
There'll be a hearing to determine who really owns this thing, she
was assured. That was in April. No hearing date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to get the DMV people to explain themselves. Naturally,
our public employees felt no obligation to explain anything. This
woman did what they told her, spent $5,000 on their say-so. Then
they grabbed her car and won't even set up a hearing so she can get
it back. And anybody who's curious about why they did that can just
mind his own business.
</P>
<P>
   I did some checking to find out how this happened. As near as I
can figure, DMV went looking for the previous owners, who'd moved
to Florida. I presume they got Florida driver's licenses, and
that's how DMV ran them down. The story, according to what Green
told me DMV told her, is that the previous owners claim that Murray
told them they could keep the car on his property. Like hell,
Murray told me. He never gave anybody permission to leave a junk
car at his rental house for three years. Why would he?
</P>
<P>
   I was a bit surprised at how tight-mouthed and defensive DMV was
with me. Then I found out that Green had written a letter to Joe
Bruno, the State Senate majority leader. This week, in the midst of
crucial negotiations on a state budget overdue by nearly four
months, Bruno himself had called and spoken to her. He might also
have called DMV.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Bruno probably asked them why they did this nutty thing
to this woman.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if they told him to mind his own business, too.

FOREIGN INTRIGUE IN THE MLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major League Soccer has completed a significant signing that
could benefit the Revolution. But if the league assigns striker
Ariel Graziani to the Revolution, MLS could also be missing out on
at least two more high-level players.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are the only MLS team with a foreign opening, and
they have been auditioning Ghanaian defender Joseph Addo this week.
Addo, 27, appears to be precisely the type of player the Revolution
need in central defense, and he displayed his class during a 2-1
exhibition loss to Ajax Wednesday, his first game since May.
</P>
<P>
   But the league signed Graziani and now must find a team for him
_ if not the Revolution, then another team, which would have to
somehow convince a foreign player to leave, as the Revolution did
with Dutch defender Richard Goulooze last month.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, the Revolution will take Graziani and attempt to trade
Venezuelan forward Giovanni Savarese to a Western Conference team
such as Kansas City or San Jose for a defender such as Uche Okafor
or Mauricio Wright. Only a desperate team would gamble by
sacrificing a quality defender, but both the Wizards and the Clash
have been struggling this season.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Revolution are in a position of strength,
though if they are unable to deal Savarese, they will be overloaded
in attack and still shorthanded defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, 28, was born in Buenos Aires but became a naturalized
Ecuadoran after playing for Aucas and Emelec. He was with Morelia
in Mexico the last two seasons and played for Ecuador in the Copa
America tournament in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani is 6 feet 1 inch, 158 pounds, an excellent sniper
around the goal, and known for his strong convictions. During Copa
America, he criticized his teammates' attitudes as they were
eliminated in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we think Addo is a good player?'' Revolution general
manager Brian O'Donovan said. ``Yes. Would we like him on our team?
Yes. But there are salary cap issues, contract negotiation issues,
other possibilities. We have to consider all the options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if we could get a bigger player we would have a greater
impact on the team; but that doesn't necessarily solve the
defensive needs our coaching staff has identified.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution host D.C. United Sunday, but the decision on a
new player likely will not be announced until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Addo, though, must make a decision on returning to Europe, where
he has been playing since leaving George Mason University in
Virginia. Several teams in Greece have made offers to Addo,
according to his Boston-based agent, Patrick McCabe, which means he
could be lost not only to the Revolution but to the league.

AT LAST, BOSTON HARBOR COMES INTO ITS OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OFF BUMKIN ISLAND _ It is often a fishing literalism (read
``lie'') to say, ``We caught a 38-inch striper on a fly'' when
referring to the boat from which one fished.
</P>
<P>
   Fraudulent except for the guy who hooked the fish, fought the
fish, boated the fish, and got to take the fish home to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   So to say ``We'' caught a wonderful striped bass on a chatreuse
and white Clausser fly a few weeks ago is really to say Wayne Ogden
caught the fish after Wayne Frieden put the boat in the right spot
and suggested we cast toward a few weed-covered baked potatos along
the east shore of Bumkin.
</P>
<P>
   Frieden is a guide (Reel Time Charters in Scituate) who usually
launches at the Hingham waterfront to access Boston Harbor with its
magnificent fish. And, thanks to the cleanup effort of the last few
years, its clean water.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden is a fly aficionado who has roamed the streams of Vermont
and Maine for trout as well as the Cape Cod surf for gamefish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're totally different worlds,'' he says of the pursuit of
trout and stripers.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was blowing hard at 4:30 a.m. when we assembled at the
Hingham town pier, and Frieden had us putting on foul-weather gear
for the passages of open water from island to island. But except
for wide expanses as between Long Island across President Roads
toward Logan Airport, even big wind could not discourage Frieden
and his 18-foot Scout. It's a good boat and took the seas well.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Harbor is amid a prolonged rebirth from its grim past,
atleast from a recreational viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no more white worm pollution,'' says Roger Brousseau,
another Boston fisherman who guides in the summer. ``Back (before
the cleanup) the fish were really bad. The flounder had liver the
color of chocolate with bumps on them.''
</P>
<P>
   During some of the heaviest pollution periods over the last 40
years, fishermen would still come from New York and New Jersey to
catch legendary Boston Harbor flounder. The water was often
polluted, with the situation getting worse each year. Whatever was
in the water did not deter the Quincy Bay Flounder Fleet from
taking home pounds and pounds of this New England bottom dweller
every spring.
</P>
<P>
   Though the harbor is far from perfect now, especially when heavy
rain backs up the city sewers, the sewage treatment on Deer Island
has changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days the water is so clear I can see 20 feet down,'' says
Lou Abate, a 26-year fisherman who also charters. ``The harbor now
is the best I've seen it since I was a kid living in Charlestown.''
</P>
<P>
   For Frieden, Abate, Brousseau and the other fishing guides _ and
for thousands of recreational anglers _ the recent story of fishing
in the 46-mile, island-studded waterway of Boston Harbor has been
all striped bass, the prized migrant. As good as this season has
been for stripers, it has not been up to the last two, says Abate.
The lack of bait _ pogies, herring, and mackerel _ has resulted in
fewer keepers and skinnier fish. Where rule-of-thumb used to be
that the length and weight of a bass would be about equal, it is
not uncommon these days to find a 35-inch striper weighing in well
under 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forage fish are disappearing,'' says Abate. ``Every
striper we catch now has crab and lobster in its belly.'' This
means that the common baitfish stripers (and many other species)
feed on are scarce. Some likely reasons are commercial pogy boats
and a swelling of the cormorant population _ a sea duck that feeds
on prodigious amounts of small baitfish.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the fishing on Boston Harbor is pretty great right
now. As the gray of the morning began to lift, we were drifting
along in the lee of Peddocks Island on the west shore of Hull Gut.
</P>
<P>
   Flyfishing, I had just announced, was great to fool around with,
after you boat a couple of keepers for the table. With that, I
chose a light spinning rod, strung a little jelly sand eel lure on
a dart, and let the wind carry my cast into the rocky shallows.
When I did get a bite I could hardly feel a thin 20-incher; I
released it from the barbless hook, and cast again. It was shaping
up to be a big schoolie day, which was fine. But just one big fish,
please!
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ogden cast a No. 8 fly line with the 3-inch,
half-and-half fly. Whipping the fly rod about five times each cast,
it occurred to me how much more exercise fly anglers get than
spincasters, how much harder they work to get their offerings to
the fish.
</P>
<P>
   This smug opinion was short-lived, however, when with a zing
Ogden's line began stripping off with the pressure of a good-size
hit. The fish ran to the boat, away from the boat, under the boat
until after a 10-minute fight a big head broke the surface with a
leap, then dived again. Five more minutes and this fish was aboard
for good _ a bright silver 38-inch striper that weighed about 23
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, says Frieden, a group on his boat took a 60-pound
bass, with a few keepers for the table. They fished the usual spots
at Bumkins, Peddocks, Rainsford, and Long Island, but made the best
catches well inside Boston Harbor by the Hyatt Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be anywhere,'' says Frieden. ``It's been a real good
week.''

MUSEUM TRIES TO PAINT ITSELF OUT OF A CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Museum of Fine Arts boss Malcolm Rogers and his painting
wallahs implement their curious Mixmastering of the MFA collections
(``Asian stuff? Yeah, that goes with African . . .''), other brush
fires continue to smolder. There is, for instance, the case of the
Hermann Goering painting.
</P>
<P>
   The canvas in question is a 16th-century Flemish paysage by
Henri met de Bles, called ``Landscape with Burning City.'' The tiny
artwork _ it measures just 5'' by 10'' and is valued at around
$60,000 _ belonged to Franz Koenigs, a German businessman who moved
to Holland before World War II. Pressed for money, Koenigs used the
canvas as collateral for a loan from a Jewish-owned bank, which
liquidated its holdings afer the Nazi invasion of Holland. The
painting ended up in the hands of a Nazi art procurer, and then
found its way to Reichmarshal Goering's office wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston arts museum bought the painting from a US dealer in
1946, when issues of previous ownership seemed less important. In
February, the Globe reported that the Dutch government asked the
MFA to return the painting in 1948. The Museum asked for
``definite'' evidence that the painting had been stolen, and the
Dutch claim lay fallow. Now that evidence abounds, events are
moving more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Rogers sent a letter to the Dutch authorities, saying
that ``the question of the ownership of the painting raises complex
and difficult legal issues that are beyond the competence of the
Museum to decide.'' There's some truth to this, as the Dutch
government itself is competing with Koenigs's granddaughter
Christine for ownership of the painting. In his letter, Rogers
proposes a neutral arbitration proceeding acceptable to Christine
Koenigs, the Dutch, and the MFA. He adds that ``the MFA does not
intend to participate as a party to the arbitration, nor do we
intend (sic) bear any costs of the arbitration.''
</P>
<P>
   Koenigs's granddaughter has formally accepted the arbitration
idea, and the Dutch government will reportedly follow suit.
Christine Koenigs will be vacationing in Massachusetts later this
summer and asked to meet with Rogers in early August. Instead, she
will be meeting with deputy director of curatorial affairs
Katherine Getchell, George Shackelford, one of the aforementioned
painting wallahs, and a lawyer from Covington &AMP; Burling's San
Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   Koenigs's granddaughter is a much bigger fan of the MFA than she
is of the Dutch government and hopes that the first-of-its-kind,
multi-national arbitration will be held in a public forum, in
Boston, where it would receive worldwide attention. Stay tuned.

   No, it's not Joe McGinniss's latest 7-page-long e-rave, this
time directed against his Italian publisher, which will probably
cancel its planned publication of Joe's soccer opus ``The Miracle
of Castel di Sangro'' because of libel concerns. The real Talk of
Billsville is about the teed-off Theatre Festival subscribers who
can't get tickets to the forthcoming ``As You Like It,'' starring
Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   My Berkshire informants say that fat-cat Festival contributors
snarfed up all the tickets before subscribers had a crack at them.
A call to the box office confirmed that a mailing to contributors,
many of whom also subscribe to the summer shows, sold out the
Paltrow play before tickets were offered to regular subscribers.
Festival spokeswoman Aimee Zygmonski says this is not the case:
``Contributors, subscribers, it's the same deal.'' Whatever the
case, my request for a press pass looks doomed.

informative review of ``The Language of Silence: West German
Literature and the Holocaust'' by German scholar Ernestine Schlant.
If only to show that the world is not a collection of biases and
hidden agendas, I think the editors should have revealed that
Schlant often uses another name: Mrs. Bill Bradley.

THE TILT OF TELEVISION

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Hunting for fowl was the sport this week on Capitol Hill, bird
against bird. As the swapping of donor lists by public broadcasting
stations unfolded, Republican Representative Steve Largent of
Oklahoma used the scandal to call for the end of government support
for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Largent, citing PBS's ``Sesame Street,'' said, ``Big Bird is
nearly 30 years old, and it's time to leave the federal nest.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Largent is not against taxpayer funding of birds
so long as they are his own fine-feathered friends. Largent is in
the pro football hall of fame for his years of catching passes for
the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when the Seahawks whined for a new stadium and
threatened to leave Seattle if they did not get one, Largent wrote
a letter of support for a 2.5 percent retail tax on sports licensed
merchandise. The taxpayers eventually approved $300 million toward
the $425-million stadium in an election where at least one voting
location had a poster of Largent at the door.
</P>
<P>
   The $300 million coerced by the Seahawks for one stadium is by
coincidence the same as all of public broadcasting is scheduled to
receive in fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Largent's selective divebombing of Big Bird is a distraction
from a far more oppressive reality of broadcasting in America. The
Corporation for Public Broadcasting certainly has some house
cleaning to do. The non-profit, taxpayer-funded organization should
present news and documentaries with a reasonable assumption of
balance. It should do whatever it can to avoid charges like those
of Republican National Committee press secretary Michael Collins
that public broadcasting is a ``wholly owned subsidiary of the
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Largent and his like-minded colleagues have been silent as
the wealthy world of commercial journalism has destroyed any myth
of a ``liberal media.'' When the big-time media quote sources on
the issues of the day, they are far more likely to use think tanks
on the right than on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness in Accuracy in Media, a left-leaning media watchdog
group, has issued many reports on who is quoted in the media. In a
search of the Nexis computer database, it found that conservative
or libertarian think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation, the
American Enterprise Institute, and the Cato Institute, comprised 53
percent of citations in 1997. Progressive or left-liberal think
tanks, such as the Urban Institute, the Economic Policy Institute
and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities received only 16
percent of citations. So-called ``centrist'' think tanks, such as
the Brookings Institution, the Council on Foreign Relations and the
Freedom Forum made up the remainder of the citations.
</P>
<P>
   Brookings, Heritage, AEI and Cato alone accounted for 46 percent
of think tank citations. The ideology of centrist and conservative
think tanks is less likely to be identified than for progressive
and left-leaning think tanks. While Brookings was cited 2,296 times
in the media, Heritage 1,813 times, AEI 1,323 times and Cato 1,286
times, the most-quoted progressive think tank, the Urban Institute,
was quoted 610 times.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided nature of conservative- and centrist-dominated
sourcing most visibly rears its head on the Sunday talk shows which
are overwhelmingly white, male and don't rock the boat, except to
throw welfare mothers out to sea. Lost in the annual carping by
Republicans about public broadcasting is how network leadership,
with the exception of centrist Democrat Michael Eisner of Disney
(ABC), is unabashedly active in conservative circles, from the
Rupert Murdoch's (Fox) funding of right-wing publications to the
anti-regulatory activities of the other networks.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious result of such leadership is that in the year 1999,
four and a half decades after the civil rights movement, the actors
and producers of the new fall entertainment shows for ABC, NBC,
CBS, Fox and WB are nearly all white. As Republicans constantly
question $300 million for public broadcasting, there is no similar
question as how corporate moguls who do $70 billion in global
business a year are so stuck on shows for young white males.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has infected public broadcasting. Far from the image
suggested by Largent and more rabid Republicans, it has
increasingly become more like the networks. In a study of public
broadcasting news sources released last month by FAIR and done by
William Hoynes of Vassar College, the percentage of on-camera news
sources sources who represent corporate America and Wall Street has
increased dramatically while the use of citizen activists as news
sources has declined from its already paltry numbers.
</P>
<P>
   FAIR's program director Janine Jackson said, ``In survival mode
for so long fending off conservative attacks, public television
seems to have forgotten its original mission to `help us see
America whole, in all its diversity.' '' That is why public
broadcasting needs more support, not less, so it has the space to
return to its original mission. That is why the divebombing of
Largent should be repelled. He wants Big Bird out of the federal
nest only so he can eat Democratic eggs.

TIGER TALES FROM A STORIED PARK

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ All Detroiters know it simply as The Corner. The
corner of Michigan and Trumbull avenues, perhaps baseball's most
noted address. The Corner where baseball has been played in Detroit
for over a century, more than 7,500 games, more than 105 million
fans gathered at The Corner to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Tales waft through the summer air, slipping around The Corner,
turning from Michigan to Trumbull and then slipping inside to Tiger
Stadium, where fans settle into the first rows of seats in the
upper deck between home and first, simply _ and there can be no
arguments _ the absolute best place in America to watch a baseball
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Al Kaline tale.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 a.m. on Al Kaline's first day in Detroit 46 years ago,
and Johnny Pesky was walking along Michigan Avenue with Kaline,
mentoring the nervous 18-year-old from the Baltimore sandlots.
``Al,'' said Pesky, ``that's going to be your home for the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kaline looked at the ballpark, once Navin Field, then Briggs
Stadium, and later to be Tiger Stadium, and said to Pesky, then
with the Tigers, ``It looks like a battleship . . . like an
aircraft carrier.'' And then Kaline walked to his room at the
Tuller Hotel, got a fitful night's sleep, walked back to the
ballpark the next day, and, of course, could not get inside.
``You're too young to be a ballplayer,'' said the guard.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Harwell remembered vividly his first glance at Briggs
Stadium in 1954, and his perception was so similar to Kaline's of a
year earlier. Harwell had been a National Leaguer, broadcasting in
Brooklyn with Red Barber and then as Russ Hodges's partner on the
New York Giants games, and now he was starting out with that new
team in Baltimore, the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming over in a cab and I saw Briggs Stadium for the
first time from the outside,'' said Harwell, now 81, still
broadcasting Tigers games after arriving here in 1960. ``It looked
so big, so imposing . . . it looked like a battleship to me from
the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   (Ironically, sports fans from outside Michigan got their first
glimpse of Briggs Stadium from watching the annual Thanksgiving Day
football games between the Detroit Lions and, usually, the Green
Bay Packers on television. The Lions played at Michigan and
Trumbull from 1937 to 1974, and the great Detroit teams of the
1950s with Bobby Layne at quarterback, Doak Walker in the
backfield, and Joe Schmidt and Dick ``Night Train'' Lane on defense
reached their peak with a 59-14 drubbing of the Browns in the 1957
NFL title game. The Lions moved to the Silverdome in 1974, grew
soft and have done nothing since leaving Michigan and Trumbull.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ballplayers come and go, a few memorable, most not. A baseball
team's identity is so much more than its players; in Detroit it is
the voice of Harwell, the old English ``D'' on uniforms so, so
white and . . . Tiger Stadium. The three _ Harwell's voice, the
English ``D'' and Tiger Stadium _ wrap themselves as one around
Detroit baseball and tradition oozes.
</P>
<P>
   A battleship from the outside. The most intimate ballfield
inside, fans overlooking first base seemingly able to reach out and
shake the first baseman's hand. Battleship gray on the outside,
lush green inside. The most imposing light towers seemingly ever
built up above _ Walter O. Briggs was the last team owner to hold
out for play in God's light, other than P.K. Wrigley in Chicago _
and dugouts so small, so intimate, down below.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has character, it has that,'' said Harwell of Tiger
Stadium, which will close at the end of the season; the Red Sox'
visit there this weekend will be Boston's last. ``But it's the
intimacy that gives it that character. It's enclosed all the way
around and that brings everything closer. Everything's centered on
that ballfield in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tales waft through The Corner, tale after tale. Babe Ruth is
said to have hit a 626-foot home run here, before the upper deck
enclosed right field, and the ball ended up two streets beyond the
fence where a Detroit sports editor tracked it down. Detroit first
baseman Johnny Neun pulled off an unassisted triple play here in
1927. Washington's Harmon Killebrew poled a ball onto the
left-field roof in 1962; Frank Howard followed in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 _ Hank Greenberg's retired number _ hangs from the face of
the roof in right field. Greenberg used to round up kids from the
historic Corktown neighborhood that surrounds the park, morning
after morning, finding kids to shag his balls. Greenberg would hit
and hit and hit until his hands would bleed and the boys would
chase and chase and chase Greenberg's balls. One of those Corktown
boys was Mike Ilitch, who would grow up to own the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   There would be days when Ilitch would notice Greenberg could not
get the balls past the infield dirt; a slugger who could not slug.
Only later would Ilitch learn that Greenberg had soaked the balls
in water overnight and the balls were heavy on purpose. All
baseball knows of the ``heavy bat;'' Greenberg was experimenting
with the ``heavy ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, in 1938, the first year that Briggs Stadium had been
completely enclosed, Greenberg assaulted Ruth's record of 60 home
runs and other players assaulted Greenberg's Judaism. Greenberg had
refused to play during Yom Kippur during the 1934 pennant race,
which made him a hero to America's millions of Jews, but gave bench
jockeys all around the American League a ripe target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst team was the Yankees,'' Greenberg once recalled
after his 58 home runs fell just short of Ruth's mark. ``They
brought up a guy from the minor leagues just to heckle me. But I
never let it show that it bothered me. I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Write this down,'' said Joe Falls, longtime columnist for the
Detroit News, a researcher of Tiger Stadium tales himself. ``Ruth
hit 60 home runs in this ballpark. Now guess who was second? Ted
Williams is second with 55 home runs here. Yogi Berra is third with
42.''
</P>
<P>
   And Williams's most famous Detroit home run was the blast with
two outs in the ninth that won the 1941 All-Star Game for the
American League. Williams skipped around the bases, spontaneous as
a kid, as spontaneous as The Kid ever was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what Williams told me about that,'' said Falls, who
is writing a book about the great moments of Tiger Stadium. ``He
told me he didn't realize what he was doing when he was going
around the bases, that he didn't know what he'd done unti two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went to a movie two days later and they had the Movietone
News, you know the reel of news highlights of the last week and
Williams saw himself skipping around the bases. He said he was
never so embarrassed . . . that maybe it was a great home run, but
it was the greatest embarrassment of his career to be skipping
around like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitors' clubhouse at Tiger Stadium, just as it was at
Briggs Stadium and Navin Field, is smaller than small. Old-timers
still mention the infamous sign that used to hang outside the
visitors clubhouse: ``Visitors Clubhouse _ No Visitors allowed.''
The park opened April 20, 1912 _ the same day as Fenway Park, even
though baseball had been played at The Corner of Michigan and
Trumbull in Bennett Park since 1896.
</P>
<P>
   Even though 485,000 had passed through the turnstiles of Bennett
Park in 1911, Pittsburgh was drawing as many as 30,000 fans a game
at its new Forbes Field and spanking new ballparks were being built
in Philadelphia (Shibe Park), St. Louis (Sportsman's Park),
Cincinnati (Crosley Field) and Boston. Detroit wanted a modern
concrete-and-steel palace.

 DETROIT: ... -steel palace.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as in Boston, heavy rains forced the postponement of the
original Opening Day of April 18 of Navin Field. Just as in Boston,
the first game was delayed for two days but, unlike Boston, the
second day's postponement was for a different reason. The Tigers
owner was superstitious Frank Navin, a man who avoided cross-eyed
people at all costs and always put his left shoe on first. Navin
did not want to open his new stadium on a Friday, the most unlucky
day of the week to him.
</P>
<P>
   Some 26,000 fans stormed the new ballpark on the next day, a
more kindly Saturday, as Cleveland's Shoeless Joe Jackson scored
the first run. But, in the bottom of the inning, the Tigers' Ty
Cobb stole home with his signature hook slide. The Tigers won the
first game, 6-5, in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Ty Cobb. What Ted Williams is to Fenway Park, Ty Cobb is as
much, if not more, to this Tiger Stadium. Linger at the corner of
Michigan and Trumbull and study the plaque hung on the side of the
giant battleship, a plaque honoring Ty Cobb, a ``Genius in
spikes.'' Argue whether Ty Cobb was the greatest baseball player
ever, but debate not that he was the most obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   Start with a late tale, an old-timer's game long after Cobb
retired. Cobb stepped to the plate and gripped the bat with hands
apart, his trademark. ``I'm not too sure of myself anymore with
this grip,'' Cobb said to the catcher before the first pitch. Then,
before the second pitch, Cobb turned to the catcher and said, ``You
might want to get back so you won't get hurt.'' On the third pitch,
Cobb laid down a bunt and easily beat it out.
</P>
<P>
   Or the tale of the old Labor Day custom in Detroit when fans
would throw their derbies onto the field at Navin Field to signal
the end of summer and thank the Tigers for their success. Cobb saw
all the hats on the field and instructed the groundskeepers to
gather them up and pack them so he could tke them back to Georgia
with him at the end of the season. And Cobb would put the derbies
on the heads of the donkeys he had clearing his fields, so the
donkeys would not get sunstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Or that Cobb usually would be the last Tiger to leave the
clubhouse, making sure to gather each last sliver of soap from the
shower floor, soap to bring back with him to Georgia for the
winter. Or the endless tales of Cobb viciously sharpening his
spikes and raising them to the face of any enemy fielder guarding
second, third, or home, or Cobb climbing into the stands to battle
hecklers or Cobb, a true racist, calling Ruth a racial epithet and
igniting one of the most infamous incidents ever at the corner of
Michigan and Trumbull.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on June 13, 1924, Cobb, now the player-manager of the
Tigers, ordered his pitcher to hit the Yankees' Bob Meusel. A
full-scale riot followed, with Cobb charging onto the field after
Ruth, and Ruth barreling into Cobb, as the two pummeled each other
as hundreds of fans stormed onto the field to join the brawl. After
police needed a half-hour to clear the field, the game was awarded
to the Yankees by forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   By 1926, while Cobb was still trying to win games the
old-fashioned way by 3-2 and Ruth and others were hitting homers,
it ended for Cobb at Navin Field. Former Tiger Dutch Leonard
charged that Cobb and Tris Speaker had helped fix a game at Navin
Field in 1919, and Cobb left Detroit for a final two seasons with
the Philadelphia A's.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Krupa is 81 years old and still is a ticket-taker far down
the left-field line at Tiger Stadium. Krupa remembers his first
Tigers game, 72 years ago, the year after Cobb left Detroit and
``it cost 6 cents for the trolley from where we lived over in
Hamtrack to get down here.'' As fans poured into the stadium, Krupa
ripped their tickets and told his tales of Michigan and Trumbull.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Gehringer is his favorite Tiger ever, Greenberg and
Mickey Cochrane not far behind (``We lost to the Cardinals in the
'34 World Series and the next year we beat the Cubs, all under
Cochrane'') and Krupa still vividly remembers his first visit to
Michigan and Trumbull.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yanks were in and it was Kids Day; the kids section was up
here in left field . . . see that runway,'' said Krupa, pointing up
to his first steps here. ``But the Babe was in right field and I
had to get over to right field to see Ruth. I had to get a close-up
of the Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   Close-ups are everywhere in Tiger Stadium. Even in left field,
behind the foul pole, the view is close, and it is even closer up
in the right-field porch that overhangs the lower deck so
dramatically that fans beyond the second row cannot even see the
right fielder below them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the upper deck between third and home that a fan
can look out and see the General Motors headquarters in downtown
Detroit and look down upon baseball virtually at his feet. And hear
tales of baseball at Michigan and Trumbull.
</P>
<P>
   Harwell told of his favorite moments and a Boston visitor
reminded him that his broadcast of the final Tigers game of the
1967 season is still memorable to many Boston fans. The Red Sox had
beaten the Twins earlier that afternoon, but Detroit was playing a
doubleheader against the Angels and needed to lose the second game.
Harwell's broadcast was piped into Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . and Dick McAuliffe grounded into a double play for the
final outs,'' remembered Harwell. And the tale grew, that that DP
to end the 1967 season was the only double play he had hit into
that season; more amazingly, McAuliffe did not hit into any DPs in
the 1968 season when Detroit won it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest play I ever saw here,'' Harwell went on, ``was
when (Willie) Horton threw out (St. Louis's Lou) Brock in the fifth
game of that '68 Series. That turned the whole Series; we were
down, 3-1, in games, we were in the fifth inning losing that game,
and Horton made the throw. We won that game and went to St. Louis
to win the final two.''
</P>
<P>
   And the tale grows and grows. Brock inexplicably did not slide
on Horton's throw and Detroit catcher Bill Freehan was able to
block the plate. Years later, Brock was still protesting he was
safe on the plate when he bumped into Freehan. ``If I was out,''
Brock said to Freehan, ``then why did you come back and tag me a
second time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were safe,'' countered Freehan to Brock, ``then why did
you come back and tag home a second time?''
</P>
<P>
   Tales from The Corner of Michigan and Trumbull. Tales of pure
baseball.

WOULD-BE EARLY RETIRER FAR FROM HAVING ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 25, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 52 and married, earning about $115,000 a year. My
company's 401(k) plan is managed by Fidelity and I have a $68,000
balance, with $49,000 in Fidelity Growth and Income and the rest in
Magellan. I currently contribute $10,000 a year, with all of it now
going into the Growth and Income fund. I also have a $106,000
balance in a prior employer's 401(k) plan, with $30,000 in Fidelity
Equity Income, $33,000 in Fidelity Magellan, $29,000 in a stock
index fund, and the rest in the stock of Lucent Technologies, my
former employer. I have been contributing to a Roth IRA with a
balance of $3,500, all invested in Vanguard Index 500 fund, but
this accumulation might not last since our joint income is close to
the $150,000 maximum allowed for Roth IRAs. What is your assessment
of my current fund allocation? If I were to retire at age 62, what
kind of income stream might I expect? This will be my only source
of income other than Social Security and a small pension of $6,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   A.B., Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. To be honest, the numbers are pretty ugly. At your current
rate of saving, you would accumulate a total of $707,049 over the
next decade, presuming you earn average returns of 10 percent on
your investments. But if inflation averages only 3 percent during
that period, you would have to discount that accumulation by about
41 percent, meaning that it would be the equivalent of $417,158 in
today's money. So even if all of the pool were then put in a
fixed-income portfolio to generate the largest possible income
stream, it would only represent the equivalent of $27,115 in
today's money. That's a pretty meager amount in comparison with
your current $150,000 family income. Social Security and your
anticipated pension will of course help, but probably not that
much. So unless there's something you've left out of the formula,
now is the time to begin a crash supplemental savings program.
</P>
<P>
   Now is also the time to begin diversifying your portfolio. The
various funds you are using are all very similar _ all holding
domestic large-cap stocks and all, with the exception of the
value-oriented Fidelity Equity Income, representing a blend of
growth and value issues. You have listed the various options
available through both the new and the old 401(k) plans. Within
your current plan I suggest you consider putting some of your
ongoing contributions in Fidelity OTC fund, giving you some
exposure to the mid-cap stocks, and putting some in Fidelity
International Growth and Income fund, giving you exposure to
overseas markets. In a few years, when you are getting closer to
your anticipated retirement, you might also decide to add Fidelity
Puritan, an excellent balanced fund, to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   As for the older 401(k) plan, the various offerings don't seem
to me to be sufficiently attractive to merit retaining the plan. My
approach would be to roll that plan over into an IRA, where you
could retain some of the investments (such as the Lucent
Technologies stock) and use the balance to establish positions in
market sectors that aren't available through your current 401(k),
most notably in small-cap and health care sector funds.
</P>
<P>
   But as I said before, the major concern is that you simply
aren't saving enough. Using that $150,000 as an estimate of your
total family income, the 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions combined
represent about 8 percent that's going into retirement savings. So
unless you are willing to face a precipitous decline in your
standard of living once you retire, I think you need to bump that
percentage up fairly sharply. If you doubled your dollar savings,
the accumulation would amount to $982,717 after 10 years, and if
you doubled your savings and continued working to age 65, the pool
would be $1,290,446. (Both of these projections again assume 10
percent average annual portfolio growth.) If you consider that your
Social Security benefit would be higher at age 65, that final
figure is probably the first in this sequence that could begin to
represent a comfortable retirement pool. Sorry to be the bearer of
such sour tidings.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My son is going to finish high school in four years. We would
like to save some money for his college education. We plan to set
aside $5,000 a month for this purpose, but do not know where the
money should be put. Would you suggest a fund for us, and let us
know how much we can expect based on historical performance of the
fund(s).
</P>
<P>
   J. L., Boston
</P>
<P>
   A. Mutual funds can be a fine vehicle for saving for a college
education, but when you wait as long as you have before beginning,
the great majority of funds are no longer appropriate. Yours
amounts to a short-term savings campaign, with your anticipation
that you'll need to begin drawing on the money in four years. I
usually suggest CDs or money market funds for such short-term
savings program, where you can expect returns in the neighborhood
of 5 percent. If you wanted to be just a little more aggressive,
you might look at a fund such as Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond
fund. This has a current yield of 6.1 percent, and has produced
average annual total returns of 6.58 percent over the past five
years. It wins a five-star rating from Morningstar Mutual Funds.
And if you're concerned that this is too tame, consider that even a
fund such as this faces some degree of risk. For example, its
year-to-date returns this year, reflecting the jumpy interest rate
climate, are only 1.68 percent. And in 1994, the benchmark year for
people who want to see how a bond fund performs in when the bond
market is in bad shape, it lost .08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important as matching the time frame of the investment
to the time frame of the savings program is the question of whose
name in which the money will be saved. If you achieved average
annual returns of 6 percent for the next four years, the savings
schedule you have laid out would amount to $26,966 after 48 months.
If this is held in your son's name, under the current formula for
student aid, 35 percent of this money would be deemed available for
tuition costs each year before any consideration is give to grants,
loans, and other assistance. If the money if in your name, the
formula calls for a maximum of 5.65 percent of this asset to be
deemed available for education costs. So if you have any
expectation at all that your son will qualify for financial aid,
keep the money in your name. This will doubtless increase your tax
bill, but for most people that cost is far outweighed by the
additional financial assistance available later on.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 33 and I am about to begin investing in my
organization's 403(b) plan. I intend to invest $400 a month. I was
told to diversify my stock investments among large-, mid- and
small-cap funds. However, one of the investment options is Vanguard
Total Stock Market Index fund. I am wondering if putting my money
there would save me the trouble of finding a diverse range of
funds. I am leaning toward index funds in either case.
</P>
<P>
   P.C., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. While the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund tracks an
index _ the Wilshire 5000 _ which represents a broad spectrum of
companies, it is heavily weighted toward the largest of them. To
track the Wilshire 5000, the fund holds 1,900 of the largest issues
included in the index, and holds about 1,300 of the 3,100 remaining
issues included in the index, with the issues selected with an eye
only to duplicating the overall performance of the index rather
than to improving on the overall performance. Since the index is
weighted my market cap, the effect is that the largest stocks
dominate the portfolio, and its overall rating is as a large-cap
blend of growth and value-oriented holding _ precisely the same
category that the better-known Vanguard Index 500 falls into. The
smaller stocks this fund holds simply don't have enough weight to
give you a great deal of diversification beyond the large caps. In
my opinion, you would end up with a much better diversification if
you followed your original plan, probably putting the lion's share
of your retirement money in Vanguard Index 500, and then dividing
the balance among its Mid-Cap Index and Small-Cap Index funds. And
if your 403(b) plan offers the excellent Vanguard Health Care fund,
that would be an excellent selection for a small percentage _ not
more than 20 percent at the most _ of your retirement savings.

PARAMETRIC LOOKS FOR RIGHT DESIGN OUT OF HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Parametric Technology Inc.'s comeback designs ever get off
the computer screen?
</P>
<P>
   The Waltham, Mass. company, once a darling among Massachusetts
software businesses, fell hard last year and stayed down.
</P>
<P>
   Sales that streaked higher for much of the 1990s hit a wall and
Parametric shares remain at about one-third of their value before a
plunge early in July last year. More than $6 billion of stock
market value evaporated and hasn't come back.
</P>
<P>
   While announcing Parametric's quarterly earnings this week,
chief executive Steven Walske continued to promote the company's
long-term turnaround plan but conceded that ``near-term results
remain somewhat uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for a confidence builder. Many analysts share the same
kind of near-term skepticism about Parametric's business prospects.
One ray of hope: investors who believed the company had hit bottom
actually pushed the stock higher when Parametric warned two weeks
ago that it wouldn't meet analysts' forecasts for its just-released
quarterly numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric rose to prominence by producing one-quarter after
another of sales that soared anywhere from 50 to 100 percent. It
pulled that off for years and Parametric grew to become the world's
sixth-largest independent software producer.
</P>
<P>
   The same company that was selling less than $87 million of its
computer-aided design software for engineers in its fiscal 1992
posted annual sales of nearly $1.1 billion just five years later,
selling to customers like Caterpillar Inc., Ford Motor Co. and
Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   And that was where Parametric's growth came to a screeching
halt. Sales for its quarter announced this week rose modestly above
year-ago comparisons for the first time in six quarters.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Pricing pressure found its way into a maturing
business. Competitors attacked the lower end of the computer-aided
design market with products that promised 80 percent of the
functionality for 20 percent of the cost, price pressure that
worked its way through the entire market.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers use computer-aided design systems to create everything
from cell phones to airplanes. Companies like Parametric license
software to corporate clients for prices that can range from
$15,000 to $20,000 per ``seat,'' another term for an engineering
station. The low-end competitors moved in on some customers with
packages that sell for $5,000 per seat or even less.
</P>
<P>
   Big unit sales growth was fading and prices were going down.
Then Asia, a significant part of Parametric's software market, hit
the skids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think their market share has declined all that much in
their core product, but that product is less profitable than it
once was,'' said analyst Ben Rose of Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric's plan: Repackage and reprice its existing products,
move into a new but related business and reorganize its deal-making
sales force.
</P>
<P>
   Its brand new Web-based product, Windchill, gave Parametric an
entry into a different software category called product data
management. Windchill made it possible for people throughout a
company, even selected outsiders, to see and share information
about a product as it was being developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us into a much broader market and strategic
relationships with our customers,'' said Wayne George, senior vice
president of strategic marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: Windchill is doing well so far, outselling a
longer-established product from cometitor Structural Dynamics
Research Corp. by a whisker in the most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: Windchill is small potatoes at the moment,
accounting for about $25 million in quarterly sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it has very high potential, but quite frankly
it's too small to offset a core business which really hasn't turned
around yet,'' said analyst Raj Seth of SG Cowen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's a start. Parametric hopes it can generate as much as
$200 million in annual Windchill revenue by the year 2000. ``If
they can execute and make those numbers, that's a very high growth
business,'' said Seth.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric also has made big changes in its sales force,
contracting out distribution of its products to smaller customers
to Rand A Technology Corp. Parametric's own sales team was
refocused, mostly on customers that could write bigger checks and
required more emphasis on a continuing relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Parametric's focus is to sell very big clients on broad
engineering software products, its way of coping with the intensive
compeitive pressure for systems with limited capability.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that strategy pans out, it will probably create
``lumpy'' quarter to quarter results because individual contracts
are likely to be larger but scarcer. Parametric said the most
recent quarter fell short of analysts' expectations in part because
deals in negotiation, collectively valued at more than $100
million, did not close during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is certain Parametric's strategy will revive rapid
growth for its core computer-aided design products right away.
Right now, investors are looking for the Windchill factor and the
jury is still out. ``I think it's going to be some time before we
can confidently suggest that the growth in Windchill will offset
the decline in the core product,'' said Rose. ``That's where we
stand.''

BIOTECH FIRMS HAVE NO PRODUCT, BUT THE MONEY'S STILL THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shareholders at next month's ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical Corp.
annual meeting won't see progress charts of the company's vaccine
drug trials or overhear the banter of Wall Street analysts looking
for clues to the company's financial future.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Aug. 18 session is essentially the
12-year-old Waltham, Mass. company's last, as shareholders
officially approve a board of directors' plan to liquidate and
dissolve the company. But unlike most companies that fall apart and
have no cash, this one has more than $42 million in the bank, money
stockholders expect to receive.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, shareholders of Ergo Science Corp. may face a
similar choice. The Charlestown, Mass. biotech company recently
announced that its only proposed drug has proved no better at
treating obesity than a placebo. But with nearly $33 million in
cash and a market value of less than half that, Ergo can either
follow ImmuLogic and give the money back to its shareholders, try
to buy some new technology, or be bought.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies illustrate the huge risks in biotechnology, where
the development of breakthrough medical drugs is extraordinarily
expensive ($75 million to $100 million), time-consuming (six to 10
years), and difficult. In order to win US Food and Drug
Administration approval, companies have to prove not only that
their drugs are a significant improvement over existing
medications, but that they are safe. While most investor and media
attention is focused on a handful of larger firms, the majority of
the nation's 1,300 biotech companies are small firms that often bet
everything on a single drug compound that may never get FDA
approval and reach profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing more biotech companies dying that should have
gone away years ago,'' said Alex M. Moot, general partner at
Seaflower Ventures, a Waltham-based health care venture capital
firm. ``They did not make the tough management decision after a
weak clinical trial or merge with another company because the
president and founder realized he may be out of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   In biotech's Darwinian atmosphere, most firms will be sold,
merge or simply split up, selling parts of promising technologies
and assets to different companies. And some, like ImmuLogic,
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This biotechnology business is very challenging, from the bets
you place on science, to the financial partners and staff that work
with you and at times it can be very rough,'' said E. Andrew
Grinstead, a former investment banker who is president and chief
executive of Hybridon, Inc., a struggling nine-year-old
biotechnology company that has run up losses of $238 million since
1990, seen employment sink from more than 200 people to 53, and its
stock price plummet from 68 1/8 in 1996 to less than 1 today.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike big pharmaceutical companies that have extensive revenue
from existing drugs to fund new ones, most biotech firms lack any
financial backup. So small biotech firms are almost always under an
investor microscope, their clinical trials scrutinized along with
the university pedigrees of the researchers and the underlying
science before another dime is raised for additional testing.
</P>
<P>
   And with investors enjoying seeing huge financial returns from
their Internet portfolios, some young biotech firms with promising
drug candidates can no longer turn to Wall Street to raise money.
So with dwindling cash, they look for corporate partners, such as
large pharmaceutical companies and bigger biotechnology firms, to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggling biotech companies we see are often
single-product companies where management has not broadened the
company's technology or companies where the science did not work
out and was not robust enough or the clinical trials for testing
the drug were poorly designed,'' said Augustine Lawlor, chief
financial officer of LeukoSite Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., which
acquired two struggling Cambridge-based biotech firms, Proscript
Inc. and CytoMed Inc., in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, like Alpha-Beta Technology Inc. of Worcester,
Mass. have disappeared because they ran out of money and their only
proposed drug failed to show significant efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   ImmuLogic and Ergo are part of another biotechnology industry
phenomenon: lots of cash and no science. Each raised substantial
sums from initial public offerings during the biotech boom of the
early to mid-1990s along with additional funds from development,
marketing, and distribution deals with large pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The money was invested in anticipation that once-promising drug
products would gain FDA approval. When proposed products proved no
better than existing drugs or simply failed to gain FDA approval,
each company dismissed its employees, closed its laboratories and
began counting the unspent cash.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ImmuLogic, which will return about $1.80 per share to
stockholders, Ergo Science has yet to pick its future, after
announcing two weeks ago that its Ergoset drug to treat obesity
proved no better than a placebo after a six-month clinical trial
involving 300 patients.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to show significantly improved results came eight
months after the FDA refused to approve the drug to treat diabetes.
That decision was made after an FDA advisory panel reviewed the
clinical data on Ergoset for diabetes and raised questions about
its long-term effects and how the drug works.
</P>
<P>
   Company president David R. Burt, one of three remaining
full-time employees, refused to comment about the Ergoset obesity
clinical trial or the company's future. The nine-year-old company
recently closed its offices, laboratory, and animal research
programs in Charlestown after dismissing most of its staff in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo Science, which 15 months ago employed 70 people and had a
stock price of 17, still has about $33 million in cash, partly from
an initial public offering and an Ergoset marketing and development
agreement from Johnson &AMP; Johnson that was canceled in January. The
stock closed at 1 1/32 Thursday on the Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   An Ergo spokeswoman said the company was appealing the FDA's
rejection of Ergoset for diabetes, and that no decision on the
company's future would be made until the FDA responded.
</P>
<P>
   But with an FDA advisory committee and the FDA itself rejecting
Ergoset, chances of gaining a reconsideration are very slim, said
Nathan Sadeghi-Nejad, a senior analyst at Sturza's Medical
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hopeless appeal,'' said Sadeghi-Nejad. ``Given the
obesity trial failure, there is no technology left. They should
give the $33 million in cash back to the shareholders. Why waste
six months of appeal to find that the FDA is not interested?''

`GORGEOUS' GOES BEHIND PAGEANT STEREOTYPES

DROP DEAD GORGEOUS 
Directed by: Michael Patrick Jann 
Screenplay by: Lona Williams 
Starring: Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Kirsten Dunst, Denise
Richards, Allison Janney, Will Sasso, Brittany Murphy, Mindy
Sterling, Sam McMurray, Mo Gaffney, Nora Dunn, Amy Adams 
Running time: 97 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (irreverent and crude humor, sex-related material and
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small town beauty pageants, like politicians, parody themselves
more devastatingly than most parodists can hope to parody them.
Still, every now and then a film like ``Smile'' beats the odds.
``Drop Dead Gorgeous,'' set in the yah-you-betcha land of Minnesota
in the hope, one surmises, of having some ``Fargo'' magic rub off,
doesn't exactly beat the odds. But before it falls apart in the
homestretch, it grapples with them adequately enough, thanks to a
quintet of actresses who find ways to carry their characters beyond
stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Lona Williams, who wrote the script from the uniquely motivated
perspective of a second runner-up in one such contest, does a
pretty good job of cartooning in the leads, but is rather less
successful at figuring out what to do with them or where to go with
them, or how far. There's little but caricature in Kirstie Alley's
aging onetime beauty princess and, thanks to her furniture dealer
husband, richest woman in town. Given her ruthless determination to
make the annual beauty contests her fiefdom and relive her youth by
railroading her daughter through to the sparkly glass tiara, the
contest is all but in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   The amusing thing in Denise Richards' portrait of Becky, the
bitchy woman's bitchy daughter, is her way of combining an air of
entitlement with plastic responses from which all traces of genuine
feeling have been purged except a pandering reflex that guides her
in shamelessly saying whatever she thinks the judges want to hear.
She gives us a worthy successor to her neo-Nazi babe to end all
neo-Nazi babes in ``Starship Troopers.'' And Kirsten Dunst, as her
only serious rival, a rose of the trailer park named Amber, has the
flip side covered.
</P>
<P>
   Amber is a winner, in life if perhaps not in the rigged beauty
contest, emerging as not only ambitious, but nice. She's determined
to become the next Diane Sawyer, and in the meantime doesn't mind
working after school as a beautician in a funeral parlor, giving
corpses the benefit of cosmetic doubt. Her mom is pretty
stereotyped, too. But at least we believe that Ellen Barkin's
Coors-swilling trailer park trashette really loves her daughter.
While it's a bit of a jolt watching Barkin play a role we'd
normally associate with Phyllis Diller or someone of that ilk, she
generates the film's only emotional force, convincing us she really
wants her daughter to escape the trailer park for a better life, as
she never did.
</P>
<P>
   That trailer park is where most of the film's rewards are to be
found. Barkin's neighbor, warm-hearted and not terribly choosy
about her deposits and withdrawals from the bank of romance, is
invested with personality, distinctiveness and likable earthiness
by the under-appreciated Allison Janney. Director Michael Patrick
Jann's pacing is OK, but he hasn't found ways to lead the actors to
enough of the individualizing details that would have lifted the
film from its predictability and consequent two-dimensionality.
Although the actors make ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' a lot easier to
take, they're not magicians and they can't conceal the film's
shortcomings. Not even the black comedy can. Although the trailer
park set keeps it watchable, ``Drop Dead Gorgeous'' hasn't enough
structural savvy to make it a winner. It deals in consolation
prizes.

MICKEY GILLEY'S HOME-COOKED COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say the word ``Gilley's'' and it still summons memories of the
``Urban Cowboy'' film shot there in 1980, back when John Travolta
followed up his blockbuster role in ``Saturday Night Fever'' by
donning a cowboy hat and taking a ride on the mechanical bull that
made Gilley's such a tourist attraction in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gilley's was dubbed the ``world's largest honky-tonk'' and was
registered that way in the Guinness Book of Records. It was a
6,000-capacity, 48,000-square-foot club in suburban Houston _ and a
``must'' stop for country performers from Faron Young and Ernest
Tubb, to Loretta Lynn, Emmylou Harris, and Rosanne Cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was or wasn't the largest honky-tonk didn't
matter,'' co-owner Mickey Gilley says today with a laugh. ``I
submitted the listing and I got it.'' He concedes that Billy Bob's
in Fort Worth ``could have been bigger,'' but it's an academic
argument because Gilley's burned down 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But not before Gilley, a nationally known entertainer and a
cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis, saved 1,000 rolls of 24-track tape
filled with performances that had aired on the ``Live at Gilley's''
radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took them home and stored them in my garage, where I kept my
buses,'' says Gilley, who is hoping to open a new Gilley's in
Dallas some day.
</P>
<P>
   After years of tracking down licensing approval from the artists
and finding the right record label fit, he has managed to transform
his tapes into a one-of-a-kind boxed set, ``Live at Gilley's,'' on
Q Records (distributed by Atlantic). It's a four-volume set
lovingly compiled by producers Alan Rubens and Clark Enslin, who
rightly call it the largest collection of previously unreleased
country music in the world _ and all of it done on the same
recording console at Gilley's.
</P>
<P>
   The new box has everything from Willie Nelson's classic ballad
``Crazy'' and Jerry Lee Lewis's ``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,''
to Ed Bruce's ``Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys''
and Loretta Lynn's ``Out of My Head and Back in My Bed.''
Lesser-known artists Razzy Bailey, Moe Bandy, and Dave and Sugar
are represented, as are legends like Carl Perkins and Fats Domino.
And, of course, honky-tonkers such as Johnny (``Take This Job and
Shove It'') Paycheck and Gilley himself (with ``Roomful of Roses'')
are in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the boxed set the last word on Gilley's. Individual live
albums from Paycheck, Domino, Perkins, and the Bellamy Brothers
have also been released. And two more live albums by Lewis and
Bobby Bare come out Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   All of this from a club that has been gone for a decade _ much
to the regret of Gilley, whose days there ended in a feud with a
partner whom he couldn't persuade to spend more money on
maintaining the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that Gilley's would have ever run its course, if
more money had been invested,'' he says. ``The parking lot had
holes in it and the building had deteriorated. And the lighting and
sound systems were outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in its glory days, Gilley's was the place to go in Texas,
witness the sign on the door that read: ``Through these doors pass
the greatest entertainers and customers in the world.'' Gilley
often played there and his band featured former Boston guitarist
Rocky Stone, a onetime mainstay with Boston's Chuck McDermott and
Wheatstraw. (Stone, who originally came from Rhode Island, was
immortalized in ``Urban Cowboy'' when Gilley said ``Take it away
Rocky Stone'' during a solo. Stone died of a stroke last year.)
</P>
<P>
   The peak for Gilley's came with ``Urban Cowboy,'' the 1980 film
whose story was developed from an Aaron Latham piece in Esquire
magazine. Gilley was skeptical that a film would ever come of it,
but ``I became a believer when I saw those trucks roll in from
Paramount.''
</P>
<P>
   While some observers later felt that ``Urban Cowboy'' had a
mixed impact on country music (attracting trendies who didn't stick
around), Gilley still waxes ecstatic when he talks about the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought a lot of people into country music that would never
have heard it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the historical impact of Gilley's, the club is often
viewed as the transition point where the more traditional country
music gave way to the crossover country-rock that is popular in the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Gilley, who just turned 63, rarely tours because he
owns his own theater in Branson, Mo., where he prefers to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pulling in 800-1,000 people a day,'' he says. ``There's
no point for me to go out on the road. This way, I don't have to
pay an agency and I don't have to worry about buses breaking down.
I'm very happy with the way things are.''

IN SATURATION COVERAGE, SOME SEE RARE COMMON FOCUS FOR SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After some point in every mega-story, journalists themselves
become the center of attention. In the last few days, much of the
conversation about the Kennedy-Bessette tragedy has focused on the
issue of media overkill.
</P>
<P>
   There was Victoria Block of WHDH-TV (Ch. 7) in Boston almost
apologizing on air for the hordes of reporters swarming on the
scene. Larry King fretted about it on his CNN talk show. And
Thursday's long local TV vigil of the USS Briscoe at sea bordered
on the bizarre, even as the networks cut away after only about an
hour of coverage broadcast nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue that the Kennedy story _ like the death of
Princess Diana, the Littleton shootings, and the O.J. Simpson trial
_ generated a full-blown media frenzy. ``If we had to define late
20th-century electronic media in one word, I'd say `overkill' would
do it,'' said Robert Thompson, head of Syracuse University's Center
for the Study of Popular Television.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when American society seems increasingly
fragmented, some observers say the media glare on events such as
Kennedy's death or Littleton serve as a kind of national hearth
where frayed bonds of community are at least temporarily restored
by a common focus on a traumatic event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are desperate for unifying forces in society,'' said
David Popenoe, a sociology professor at Rutgers University. ``I was
saying the other day that I think we need royalty back. This guy
(Kennedy), I think, is as close as you can get to American
royalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist and Harvard Medical School faculty member William
Pollack concurred that the media's treatment of the Kennedy story
brought people together, serving as ``a large emotional
journalistic holding environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think journalists are responding to a natural need and
feeling,'' he added. ``Most people feel so fragmented in their own
tragedies, their own communities.'' So the Kennedy tragedy
``becomes symbolic of something greater . . . . It's the symbol of
one family's struggle, of a sense of community that most people
don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is something else at work here that has a value
people are overlooking,'' said Thompson. Blanket coverage of events
like the Kennedy story harks back to the pre-cable television era
when three dominant networks spread common values and information,
he said. ``Overkill, in a strange way, has brought this back to us
. . . We've got this history-less generation who cannot get away
now from a series of minidocumentaries.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Simpson trial, Thompson asserted, the lesson
was the legal system. In the scandal involving Monica S. Lewinsky,
the subject was constitutional issues. And Kennedy's death
resurrected the story of the Camelot White House and Cold War
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in many ways, that may be the greatest legacy JFK Jr.
will leave,'' he said. ``The legacy of that family has been put
back in the popular culture hopper.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cultural and media analysts concur that saturation
coverage of a story like the Kennedy tragedy can unite Americans.
But they don't necessarily view that as healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are drawn together, but we are drawn together with a
melodramatic tabloid culture,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of The
Pew Research Center For The People &AMP; The Press. ``We're being held
togther psychologically by a series of crimes, accidents, and
celebrity melodramas . . . . I don't think it stitches us together
the way `I Love Lucy' did in the 50's.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said that in a new Pew survey, 76 percent of Americans
identified reducing crime as a top national priority even as
violent crime is at its lowest point in a quarter century. He
attributes at least some of that excessive fear to the media's full
court press on the Littleton massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we definitely come together in a case like this over
grief,'' said Jon Katz, the Freedom Forum's First Amendment
scholar. ``The question is whether that's a healthy way to come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz said the treatment of Kennedy's death has distorted the
reality of his life, creating ``an icon who has been elevated past
his real place in the culture. It's very unifying, but it's also
distorting, as it was with Princess Diana.'' In both cases, Katz
said, media attention was driven by ``the glamour factor instead of
the news factor . . . . We have to be careful about what we are
rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry McGill, research director for the Media Studies Center,
said the mega-stories may create an antimedia backlash. He pointed
to a survey this year in which 53 percent of the respondents said
the news media has too much freedom _ a figure that's up 15 percent
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can relate that to what people have seen unfold in
the past two years,'' he said, referring not only to several highly
publicized journalistic scandals, but the perceived overkill on
Princess Diana's accident and the Clinton sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the news media created _ or simply fed _ the
public interest in Kennedy's death, McGill said, ``We've been
creating it for 38 years. We're kind of closing the circle now.''

EXTRAVAGANCE OF GESTURE IN CARAX'S `LOVERS ON THE BRIDGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
LOVERS ON THE BRIDGE 
Written and directed by: Leos Carax 
Starring: Denis Lavant, Juliette Binoche, Klaus-Michael Glauber 
Running time: 120 minutes(in French with subtitles) 
Rated: R (violence, language, sexuality/nudity, and substance
abuse) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a special subdivision of film history to which ``Lovers
on the Bridge'' belongs. It is the history of great follies. Leos
Carax's extravagant rhapsody, filmed in 1989, released in its
native France in 1991 but not released in the United States until
now, has been likened to ``Heaven's Gate.'' But in scale, look, and
temperament, it's more of a piece with Francis Ford Coppola's ``One
From the Heart.'' Coppola's gloriously surreal ode to romance in
Las Vegas was sunk by its plotlessness, but it went down with all
flags flying, a film that exhilarated you with its heart-lifting,
if unanchored, images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovers on the Bridge,'' or, to use its more revealing French
title, ``Les Amants du Pont-Neuf,'' seldom focuses on the upbeat.
Essentially, it's about two homeless drifters who come to rest on
Paris's oldest bridge, closed to traffic because it's about to
undergo repairs. Denis Lavant's Alex is a street scavenger and
performer. Juliette Binoche's Michele is an artist who is losing
her sight. When we first see Alex, he's literally banging his head
against the pavement until he becomes part of a police roundup of
derelicts, stacked dispiritedly in a shelter. After he meets
Michele, his mood improves.
</P>
<P>
   The film peaks in a romantic outlaw moment. As Paris pulls all
the stops out for the bicentennial of the French Revolution, they
knock out a policeman and steal his motorboat. With exploding
fireworks as a nocturnal backdrop, he drives and she water-skis
along the Seine, giddily, mischievously re-creating the spirit of
popular uprising being celebrated. A look at the drawings Binoche
did to fill Michele's portfolio is revealing; they're quickly and
impulsively executed, filled with a likable no-looking-back
quality, paralleling her performance. When we learn that Michele
has turned her back on a stifling suburban existence, preferring to
exchange the prospect of sightlessness and uncertainty for freedom,
we believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Carax had permission to use the actual Pont-Neuf, but production
delays prevented him from doing so before the permit expired and
the bridge's scheduled restoration began. Undaunted, Carax built a
full-scale reproduction of the bridge 500 miles away on a lake near
Montpellier. It's his extravagance of gesture that keeps you
watching a movie that frankly grows pretty tedious pretty often.
His brief for the deprivations of the homeless turns into a selfish
romanticizing of the view that only the young really know what
suffering means (probably the reverse is what's true).
</P>
<P>
   Also, Alex's love is not high-minded. Possessiveness leads him
to steal some money Michele could have used to leave. At the end,
Carax raises the specter of Alex preferring Michele sightless and
therefore dependent on him, twisting the knife on the love-is-blind
adage. The display of fireworks played against Johann Strauss gives
way to the chill invasion of winter on a wave of sentimentality
and, worse, self-pity. Long before the end, Carax seems to have
lost his own vision, weirdness, uniqueness, and a sense that you're
making contact with a character's pain _ and replaced it with a
glum panorama of poses. In short, ``Lovers on the Bridge'' is a
film that clips its own wings. But before it does, and crashes to
earth, it flies as few films do.

LIVE, LOONY `GADGET' WORTHY OF INSPECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
INSPECTOR GADGET 
Directed by: David Kellogg 
Screenplay by: Kerry Erin and Zack Penn (based on animated cartoon
characters created by Andy Heyward, Jean Chalopin and Bruno
Bianchi) 
Starring: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Michelle
Trachtenberg, Andy Dick, Rene Auberjonois, Dabney Coleman, Frances
Bay, Cheri Oteri 
Running time: 80 minutes 
Rated: PG (whacky violence/actioon, language and innuendo) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' is the kind of lively yet safely innocuous
film that parents of young children seek but haven't often found
this summer. It fills a niche, and more impressively than might
immediately be apparent. The film's source is an animated cartoon
series brought to sunny two-dimensional life. It's centered on
Matthew Broderick, who musters a warmly sympathetic fleshing out of
a lowly security guard transformed into a bionic cop after being
crunched by the story's bad guy and left for dead. What the baddie
doesn't count on is that the daughter of a murdered scientist is as
smart as her father was and can revive the near-corpse and rig him
with more than enough mechanical and electrical attachments to even
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   The making of a live-action movie that plays like a cartoon is
tougher than it looks, and tougher still when the filmmakers and
actors must mesh all the visual and special and computer generated
effects. But they bring it off smoothly and perkily here. They give
the characters enough personality to keep the technology from
taking over, even though the reconstituted Inspector Gadget does a
lot of flying and leaping and bounding around when he isn't tooling
around in a specially reconditioned Lincoln Continental convertible
called the Gadgetmobile. Stuffed with toys that further extend the
Inspector's crime fighting abilities, it also brings no end of
delight to the Inspector's young niece. As played by Michelle
Trachtenberg, she'll give girls someone with whom they can
pleasurably identify in a film generous in female role models.
</P>
<P>
   The bad guy role _ a diabolical billioniare bent on world
domination _ is filled with stylish sneering by Rupert Everett.
He's called Claw, an obvious reference to the fact that he's more
than slightly reminiscent of Captain Hook. Like the manually
disadvantaged Captain, he plays archly and commandingly off two
comic foils, Andy Dick as his house scientist and Michael G.
Hagerty as his hired muscle. Joely Fisher's scientist is a big
plus, too. In a few broad strokes she convincingly paints a heroine
both brainy and charmingly scatty. And she's a hoot when she pays
her evil robotic double Madonna-style. It's rare to find that
what's supposed to be light family entertainment actually is
light-handed and buoyant. This movie plays as if it has the same
springs in its shoes as the Inspector does. It's the most likable
live-action family comedy from Disney since ``George of the
Jungle'' a few years ago.

GHOST BUSTED: `HAUNTING' FLOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE HAUNTING 
Directed by: Jan De Bont 
Screenplay by: David Self (based on Shirley Jackson's novel, ``The
Haunting of Hill House'') 
Starring: Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson, Lili
Taylor, Bruce Dern, Marian Seldes, Alix Koromazay, Todd Field 
Running time: 117 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (intense horror sequences) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you crave horror, you're better off seeing ``The Blair Witch
Project'' a second or third time than seeing ``The Haunting.''
Unless, of course, your idea of of a good time is going to a horror
movie and laughing at it. Because it had no special effects budget,
``The Blair Witch Project'' went back to basics and rediscovered
dread. It cost something like 1 percent of the budget for ``The
Haunting,'' which is devoured by its special effects and connected
to nothing credible as it torments three insomniacs paid to rattle
through a gloomy old mansion. They have been duped into believing
they're participating in a study of the mechanics of sleep
deprivation. Actually, it's an experiment in terrifying the easily
rattled.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, we've got an old-dark-house movie, with sadism
masquerading as science. If the title sounds familiar, it's because
this is a remake of Robert Wise's first-rate 1963 ``The Haunting,''
based on Shirley Jackson's novel ``The Haunting of Hill House.''
This time, Lili Taylor plays the virginal nervous wreck Julie
Harris played the first time around, and Catherine Zeta-Jones plays
the Greenwich Village lesbian played by Claire Bloom. Ghosts figure
prominently, too. So does the house that brings new meaning to the
term ``living room.'' Although set in New England, the original
film was shot in England. The exteriors for this one were, too. In
fact, the huge baronial Victorian stone pile is the best thing in
the film.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests oppressiveness central, a place no human being would
willingly live today. It would have to support itself by being
rented out for corporate Halloween parties. We're quite willing to
believe that it is an old robber baron's monument to conspicuous
consumption in the Berkshires, where reverse ostentation dictated
that overbuilt residences be referred to as cottages. This
``Haunting'' is on solid enough visual ground (except for trying to
pass off what looks like an English housing block for a section of
Boston) before it makes the mistake of moving the story inside the
house. There the walls and vaulted ceilings breathe in and out like
giant overdecorated lungs, and bloody footprints trail across the
floor. And the extravagant collision of styles and periods suggests
a Hollywood Gothic movie palace with its mix of medieval, Moorish,
Egyptian, and other heavy decor.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins plummeting as soon as the characters begin
talking. The unspeakably moronic script gets worse as it goes
along, leaving the actors standing there with their faces hanging
out. All would have been better off saying nothing, just standing
around pointing a lot and looking terrified, especially after they
learn that the place was built by a 19th-century textile
millionaire who worked children to death in his sweatshops. You
can't believe how bad this film gets and how fast. Director Jan De
Bont comes to an abrupt and what I trust will be a temporary career
halt after ``Speed'' and ``Twister.'' About Liam Neeson's
experimenter and Owen Wilson's subject, the less said the better.
As for Taylor and Zeta-Jones, they deserve consolation for the way
the script hangs them out to dry.
</P>
<P>
   This, frankly, is the only time Taylor has ever been ludicrously
unconvincing. Zeta-Jones, meanwhile, so enticing in ``The Mask of
Zorro'' and even ``Entrapment,'' reminds us that nobody's luck
lasts forever. Her job here makes her seem particularly exposed,
since it shuttles between exploiting her legs by requiring her to
frequently walk away from the camera in a series of short skirts
and having her make halfhearted passes at Taylor's character. By
placing all its faith in production design and high-powered
computerized effects, and not enough where it really matters,
namely character and atmosphere, ``The Haunting'' relegates itself
to the slag heap of embarrassing claptrap. It's as altogether
synthetic as its digitally enhanced (as they mistakenly insist on
calling it) heavy breathing. Frankly, my house is scarier. For that
matter, my mortgage is more haunting than ``The Haunting.''

IN FRENCH `DINNER GAME,' ALL THE PIECES FALL INTO PLACE

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE DINNER GAME 
Written and directed by: Francis Weber (based on his play) 
Starring: Jacques Villeret, Thierry Lhermitte, Francis Huster,
Alexandra Vandernoot, Daniel Prevost, Catherine Frot 
Running time: 82 minutes (in French with subtitles) 
Rated: PG-13 (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timing is everything, especially in French farce. When a French
farce goes right, it is impossible to say that this or that line or
piece of business is what's funny. What's funny is the way all the
pieces fit together and keep building, until the hilarity
avalanches, laughter is released, and the process begins all over
again. This is what we're talking about in ``The Dinner Game,'' a
piece of tangy, frothy perfection translated by writer-director
Francis Weber from his long-running Parisian boulevard comedy hit.
</P>
<P>
   Everything goes boisterously right in this farce about
everything going wrong in the life of a smug Parisian hotshot
played by Thierry Lhermitte. Part of what feeds the fun is that he
deserves the trouble he gets and that his conceit blinds him to the
sight of the skies, in that wonderful ``Beyond the Fringe'' phrase,
turning black with the wings of chickens coming home to roost. Not
only does he regularly cheat on his wife and the taxman; he and his
pals enjoy a cruel game that involves regular Wednesday night
dinners to which they invite somebody to poke fun at.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever invites the biggest fool wins. The publisher is
convinced he's got a lock on the championship after discovering a
drudge of an accountant in the Ministry of Finance. As played with
roly-poly obliviousness by Jacques Villeret, the poor sap named
Francois Pignon clinches the idiot sweepstakes with his deadly
earnest obsessional hobby _ building matchstick replicas of famous
buildings and landmarks. What the publisher, Pierre, can't know,
but all too quickly learns, is that beneath his all too genuinely
obsequieous bumbling, Francois is the loosest of loose cannons.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is for Francois to come to Pierre's apartment for a
drink, after which they'll proceed to the dinner. Not surprisingly,
they never get out of the place, as the ever-obliging Francois
sweetly demolishes Pierre's digs and then demolishes his life. His
secret is his eagerness to be helpful, and his way of delivering
the help so clumsily and with such spectacular maladroitness that
whatever he touches turns into smoking rubble. When he commiserates
with Pierre over a back injury Pierre sustained at golf, you know
it's only a matter of time before Francois' good intentions are
going to have Pierre writhing on the floor, in more pian than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Francois then compounds the damage by mixing up the responses
that the immobilized Pierre can't make to answering machine
messages from his wife, who phones to say she's leaving him, and
his lover, who phones to say she's coming over. Disaster magnet
that he is, Francois even brings into the picture that eternal star
of every good Frenchman's nightmares, the tax collector, and for
good measure riles him up, too. Villeret has had 600 stage
performances to hone his portrayal of the innocent who keeps
opening the door to bigger and bigger calamaties. The pacing and
efficient clockwork flavor of the action are part of the fun, too,
in this film that's smart enough to regenerate its stage energies
rather than try and conceal them. ``The Dinner Game'' is giddy
froth cordon bleu.

`COAST' A ROAD TRIP TO AVOID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
COAST TO COAST 
By Frederic  Raphael 
Catbird Press, 231 pp., $22.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederic Raphael is best known as a screenwriter, currently as
the writer who collaborated on director Stanley Kubrick's final
film, ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' He's also a prolific novelist and
short-story writer. Reading his 19th novel, ``Coast To Coast,'' one
can see why Kubrick hired him. Raphael is good at elliptical,
insinuating dialogue between men and women, the kind of freighted
exchanges that Edward Albee did to perfection in ``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?''
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby and Marion Pierce are no George and Martha, although
they are a contentious pair. They've been together for 30 years
when they embark on one last trip before the divorce. It's a
hellish cross-country drive from their home in Ipswich to Los
Angeles, where their son Benjamin is to be married. They're
carrying along some heavy baggage, the death of another son,
Christopher, in a car accident. Barnaby and Marion, eaten up by
guilt and grief, talk endlessly about everything except the loss
that's finally driving them apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coast To Coast'' is a bitterly funny story about the end of a
long marriage. It's nearly all dialogue, and reads like the
screenplay it's bound to become. The American-born Briton Raphael
has written several successful screenplays, including ``Darling,''
for which he won an Academy Award in 1965. Thirty years ago he
wrote ``Two For The Road,'' a film that starred Audrey Hepburn and
Albert Finney as a young married couple driving across Europe,
bickering their way to a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coast To Coast'' is a dark reflection of ``Two For The Road.''
There's no happy ending for the Pierces. There's no happiness at
all, although there are lots of one-liners. Barnaby is a has-been
TV sitcom writer (``The Stinkinsons'' ``Sergeant Bimbo'') a
compulsive kidder with an almost pathological need to be funny. His
wife, once his best audience, isn't laughing any more.
</P>
<P>
   Barnaby drives his precious red Jaguar E-type, which he plans to
give to his son as a wedding gift. As they make their way cross
country they stop here and there to visit various people from their
past, including a some with whom Barnaby or Marion have had
extramarital sexual entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   This trip is a stilted premise for a novel. The stops are
absurdly eventful, but it is, after all, a comedy, however bleak.
They find their daughter Stacey pregnant by her estranged husband
and living with a black basketball star. Barnaby's former writing
partner Stan drops dead doing _ at Barnaby's insistence _ his
impression of Eddie Cantor. A visit to Marion's former college
professor/lover finds him living under the same roof with a very
young woman and his elderly ex-wife, who only emerges at night to
pad about the house like a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   The miles go by and Barnaby and Marion go at one another tooth
and nail. Some of the dialogue is sharp, a lot of it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   He: ``You really hate me, Marion, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   She ``I know you is what I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   He: ``To know is to hate. We only love what we don't get too
close to. Tall, dark strangers. Kids with big eyes and legs like
sticks. Singapore. Rain forests. English TV.''
</P>
<P>
   That exchange comes in the second chapter, when they've barely
hit the road. It's fair warning that it's going to be a very long
trip, and it is. By the time the story closes, with a perverse and
unconvincing surprise, readers may be wondering why they came along
for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Pierces are a tiresome couple, with Barnaby cracking wise
and needling Marion, and Marion endlessly analyzing Barnaby. After
the divorce, Marion plans to move into Boston and study to be an
analyst. Meanwhile, she practices on Barnaby, saying things like,
``ask yourself why your real feelings are so angry and why you save
them for when we're alone.''

<P>
   For all their talk, Barnaby and Marion never come to life.
Perhaps they'll fare better in the movie, portrayed by actors
capable of wielding Raphael's language like the weapon it's meant
to be. ``Coast To Coast'' has some wonderful comic moments, but
ultimately it doesn't reward the careful reading it requires.

OIL-BASED POLY BEST FOR DO-IT-YOURSELFERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 25, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON

<P>
   Q. My son sanded his pine board floors in the hall and on the
stairs. What is the best finish he can put on those floors himself?
</P>
<P>
   MILDRED COOK, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Best bet for the do-it-yourselfer is three coats of oil-based
polyurethane varnish. Two coats for hardwood such as oak, birch, or
maple, three coats for softwood such as pine.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, specialists have suggested high gloss as the
toughest finish. Today the satin or semigloss is considered just as
tough. Besides, high gloss will dull down in time.
</P>
<P>
   How about the new water-based polyurethanes? No way. Because the
water-based varnishes are tenderer than oil-based, seven coats are
recommended, and at $30 a gallon this is ridiculous. Water-based is
OK for furniture, but even so, you have to be careful for two
reasons: 1. The water-based stuff can cloud up if you apply it too
thickly; and 2. If you are refinishing a piece, water-based
varnishes are not compatible with shellac or oil-based varnishes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I get paint drippings off rather rough brick and an
asphalt driveway?
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA WILLIAMS, Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. For the brick, apply chemical paint remover (Stripeeze or
5F5), wait 15 minutes, scrape, then rub with coarse steel wool.
Rinse with paint thinner. Repeat as necessary. On asphalt, do not
use chemical remover; it'll dissolve the asphalt; rub lightly with
a steel brush, then seal with driveway sealer. You may have to do
the whole driveway. Sealing a small area will not match the rest of
the driveway. If the area is small, spray it with a flat black
enamel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is eight years old with Pella windows. In one boxed
window, a piece of sill is rotting. How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   DANA ROGERS, Rowley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. After only eight years, Pella should replace the window. I
think it is the design of the window and/or the way it was
installed in a ``box'' that caused the decay. Modern windows (it
does not matter what brand) are generally made very tight, frame
and all, which does not provide for drainage, as old windows do.
Also, sometimes the sill is level, rather than sloped downward.
Both these designs can lead to standing or trapped water, and with
water that does not drain away, decay is inevitable, even when the
windows are properly primed and painted. Another thing: Some
windows rely on caulking to make them watertight, which is OK in
itself, but caulking can trap water behind it and wear off,
requiring a new application.
</P>
<P>
   You have two choices, if the window is not replaced. Cut out the
decayed part until you reach sound wood, apply bleach to the fresh
wood to kill any fungi that caused the decay in the first place,
rinse and let dry. Then nail or screw on a filler piece of wood,
caulking the joint well. It would be best to use pressure-treated
wood as the filler piece.
</P>
<P>
   The second choice may be better if the decayed area is not too
big and does not go all the way through the sill. That is to dig
out the decay, treat with bleach, rinse and let dry, and fill the
gap with an epoxy wood filler.
</P>
<P>
   What about Bondo, the auto body epoxy filler? Alan Hill of
Winchester, a restoration architect, said Bondo is not good for
filling decayed wood areas because it does not move with the
movement of the wood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Outside noise is coming through my double-glazed patio
sliders. The sliders face a driveway and are about 50 feet from the
street. My neighbor has new sliders that are soundproof. I tried
self-stick foam insulation without success. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   DON McGINNIS, Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Any insulation or weatherstripping that stops the passage of
air and heat will also stop the passage of sound. My guess is that
your weatherstripping has worn out. Any self-stick foam will rub
off quickly. If you install such weatherstripping in autumn and do
not use the door until spring, it should last that long. If you
know the brand of the sliders, the manufacturer may be able to
provide new weatherstripping. It's worth checking out.
</P>
<P>
   Your neighbor's doors are soundproof because they are new;
perhaps, too, they are of a better quality than yours. This leads
me to suggest buying new sliders. Better yet, buy French doors, the
kind that open like a regular door. They can be weatherstripped
more effectively than sliders, and permanently.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do termites like Homasote? My three-season room has Homasote
walls and ceilings. They're in good shape except for water-stained
sections from the floor up six inches. I plan to cut out the
stained stuff and replace it with a pressure-treated board. Would
that help?
</P>
<P>
   J.N., North Shore, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It certainly would, but it will not do much against termites
if they are in the house. Homasote is ground-up newspapers pressed
like papier-mache into a rigid board. It is pure cellulose, dessert
to termites, but it may be too thin for the termites to work in it.
If you have no signs of termites, don't worry about it.

PETER NOONE'S STILL INTO SOMETHING GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their cheery pop tunes were lightweight, their resurrections of
music-all ditties were corny. But Herman's Hermits pulled it off
with teenage verve and British aplomb _ bursting onto the scene in
1964 with ``I'm Into Something Good'' and outselling the Beatles
the very next year, thanks to six Top 40 hits in 1965, among them
``Mrs. Brown, You've Got A Lovely Daughter'' and ``I'm Henry VIII,
I Am.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Noone was 15 when Herman's Hermits formed in Manchester,
England. Now he's 52, living in Santa Barbara, Calif., with his
family and touring with the Teen Idols. A recent three-year stint
as host of VH1's ``My Generation'' returned Noone to the national
spotlight in the States. Far from feeling like a has-been milking
the nostalgia fad, Noone ecstatically describes a fan base that
includes scads of recent converts as well as their parents. ``For
some reason I'm suddenly having this incredibly popular period.
It's like the audience has doubled,'' he says, sounding truly
astonished, on the phone from his home. ``I think the Internet's
got a lot to do with it. People discover a lot of things, like the
'60s, and I'm one of the few who still has a presence. I've had 3
million hits to my Internet site (www.peternoone.com) so far.''
</P>
<P>
   A consummate showman, Noone believes wholeheartedly in giving
the people what they want in concert: the golden oldies. That was a
problem for Davy Jones, Noone says, who left the tour and was
replaced by another Monkee, Mickey Dolenz. Bobby Sherman is also
part of the lineup. ``Davy wanted to do other stuff,'' Noone says,
referring to Jones's new material. ``But the audience just kept
shouting out for `Daydream Believer.' What the audience wants and
what you want to do are quite often two different things. What I
want, though, is what they want.'' He is still genuinely fond of
the old catalog. ``I really like `There's a Kind of Hush' and `I'm
Into Something Good.' Noone sings a snippet _ dreamy accent intact
_ over the phone, then recalls that ``we really did want to be the
up guys. Doing the everyone's-falling-in-love songs.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ongoing mission to do right by his fans, Noone doesn't
make new records, but rather records his live shows for release. It
is, Noone says, a matter of philosophy. ``I really believe that all
great rock 'n' roll records are made by people under 25. I did it
once before, and I was really good at it. It was simple. It was 100
percent. Once you're over 25, you know the names of politicians and
have a mortgage. That's anti-rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman's Hermits' success was phenomenal but short-lived. As the
'60s progressed and pop music began to evolve in more serious
directions, the band's hits dried up. Herman's Hermits called it
quits in 1971. Noone still thinks the band's members probably had
another 10 years of touring in them, but is happy they ended on a
high note. ``I was done with it,'' he says, confessing, ``I really
am a spoiled brat, and I didn't like democracy. When we were on the
up and up, I was a willing participant. But when we started opening
for some new band, I said `no more.' No one else really got that.
We finished at Madison Square Garden. So Herman's Hermits was a
gem, as opposed to something that had gone to the Holiday Inn
lounge.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden rise and fall of a teen idol didn't take the toll it
often does on a young star, Noone says, mainly because the
wide-eyed singer really was as innocent as he seemed. ``We never
really suffered from that. I guess I thought everyone really was in
love with me. When you're 15, you don't have much knowledge, and
romantic interludes were always special things to me. It took me
years to figure out what was really going on, even though I hung
out with the guys who knew what was going on, like the Beatles and
the Stones. They were much more fun than the guys in my band.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the new generation of teen idols, Noone isn't terribly
familiar with the music. His guide to contemporary music _
13-year-old daughter Natalie _ isn't into the boy bands. ``They're
preppy,'' Natalie shouts from across the room. ``I like Monica and
Brandy and Madonna.'' Noone's tastes run toward the classics. Asked
what he's been listening to, Noone walks to his CD player. ``It's
Jeff Beck, before that the live Stones record, before that Jimi
Hendrix, and a Johnny Mercer collection.''
</P>
<P>
   He may not listen to them, but Noone does have a bit of sage
advice for the new kids whose stars are on the rise. ``Be nice to
your friends, 'cause in 30 years you'll want them to be around. And
find out what the real event is: the show. It's not the dressing
room or the hotel or the business. They should work all day to get
the show right.''

`DARK SIDE' SHOWS MINISSTRY'S LIGHTER SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where, you might wonder, could there be a possible intersection
between lightweight goofball pop parodist ``Weird'' Al Yankovic and
fierce Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen?
</P>
<P>
   Consider Ministry's latest album, ``Dark Side of the Spoon,''
with its multiple entendres. the most obvious being the pun on Pink
Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Poking fun at something like that is kind of easy,'' says
Jourgensen, from his Chicago base, ``I almost felt embarrassed,
like a `Weird' Al Yankovic kind of thing -- it's that obvious.
Someone said we should call the tour the `Wish You Were Beer' tour.
But I realized the other connotations - being spoonfed music, and
the fat American tourist, which I especially noticed in Europe,
i.e.: the cover of the record.'' And, there's the drug reference, a
spoon being an implement in heroin use, with which Jourgensen has
some familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``By being honest over the years it's landed me in a lot of hot
water,'' he says. ``And I understand. But it just became bigger
than the music, myself. People come up to you in a restaurant and
say, `You're so cool, shoot up right here!' What does the title of
the album say -- it's the dark side. Drugs are a vehicle. It's how
you use them and not abuse them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jourgensen has had a 17-year partnership with the moew
level-headed keyboardist Paul Barker. How does the chemistry work?
``I do the chemicals, he doesn't,'' says Jourgensen, laughing.
``Sorry, you set me up. Actually, it's very cool. We've had our
spats, but never a geyser of an explosion. We respect the hell out
of each other. I'm the frontman by default; there's not an ego
thing. The second thing is my strengths are his weaknesses and vice
versa. He might give up on something too soon, where I'm a pit
bull. But he will tell me when something is (bad). And it's great
that we don't hang outside of it anymore. At first it was great
'cause we built the bonds that lasted by being best friends. And we
still are -- it's a buddy movie waiting to happen. But we don't
hang in the same circles -- which brings in new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ministry, which began in Boston in 1982 as a frothy new
wave-synth band, soon mutated into a leader in the industrial rock
field. ``Dark Side of the Spoon'' is being tagged by Ministry's
label, Warner Bros., as somewhat less assaultive, and brimming
with, of all things, joie de vivre. Uh. . . ``Compared to (the last
album) `Filth Pig' this is like Mother Teresa,'' says Jourgensen.
``Joie de vivre? Well, yeah, comparatively. It's all relative.
Ministry's joie de vivre is like an 8-year-old's nightmare about
dinosaurs. But we did take a different approach. There's a lot of
jazz influences, a sax and banjo in `Nursing Home' ... We settled
into using things that Ministry is good at while still stretching.
I feel like a wine-taster - it's pensive with a bouquet.'' As it
happened, Ministry - which includes guitarist Louis Svitek and
drummer Rey Washam - recorded and then scrapped almost an entire
album. They salvaged two songs and started over on new material.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was a lot of fun making this record,'' says
Jourgensen.
</P>
<P>

----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just when you've lost all hope for rock 'n' roll girls - what
with Britney, Monica, B(asterisk)Witched, Shania and their ilk --
along comes the Donnas, four gals, all sporting the first name of
Donna, who started playing together in high school and are now all
of 20, save guitarist Donna R. (Allison Robertson) who's just about
to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Early inspirations, says singer Donna A. (Brett Anderson) were
all-gal bands such as Shonen Knife, the Muffs and L7. (Initial band
names: Raggedy Anne and the Electrocutes.) They suffered insults
from classmates, says Donna A., ``but we didn't care. They compared
us to the Bangles, said we couldn't play. Guys made fun of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Donnas persevered, were discovered by songwriter/indy rock
guy Darrin Rafaelli, and things clicked when they collaborated. The
Donnas, which was featured in the flick ``Jawbreaker,'' also
borrowed from the Ramones: a few chords, a memorable melody, one
main idea (humorous, ticked off or both) and a lot of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been around forever,'' says Donna A., ``and they have
a really good way of keeping things simple. We lost people when we
made things complicated. We learned the simpler you keep it, the
more people can enjoy it - and it can still be good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Donnas is touring behind its third album, ``Get Skintight.''
Donna A. says they've outgrown the Mickey Mouse Club-like outfits
that had their names written across their chests. ``Too
overwhelming,'' she says. ``That's all people cared about, we were
at risk of being trivialized. Now we dress up in bright, shiny
colors.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a misconception, she says, it's that people hear
angry songs and ``think we're bitches. They meet us and say,
`You're so nice!' We're only rude to people who are rude to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is sex appeal - ``It's not like we can say it's not
there'' - but don't go to ogle. ``When people say that's all we
are,'' Donna A. says, of the sex symbol role, ``then we get pissed.
And when they say we're good for girls, we're offended. You might
as well say, `I am a bigot.'''

TED SHOWS THE OTHER KENNEDYS HOW TO COPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `You never worked for living,'' sputtered his Senate rival in a
1962 debate. ``If his name were Edward Moore,'' an exasperated
Eddie McCormack appealed to the audience, ``Your candidacy would be
a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Some career. Some joke. Edward Moore Kennedy today sits third in
Senate seniority, arguably of more influence than 99 others. What
other lawgiver among the 535 in Congress is known universally by a
nickname?
</P>
<P>
   As the numbing loss of John F. Kennedy Jr. in the plane crash
recedes with the tides of Vineyard Sound, people speculate: How
does the family cope? The answer is that the family copes the way
Teddy has learned to cope. Say what you want about his professional
career, his personal life, his waistline or his big red nose, and
his enemies make the cruelest jokes imaginable; but Teddy has big
shoulders. He's the one who's carried the load since Bobby went in
the ground. And there've been a lot of funerals. I covered his
father's, his mother's, and everyone of a certain age remembers the
two brothers, the baby, the president's wife, and now her only son.
</P>
<P>
   The family copes the way Teddy shows them. How? For starters,
he's always been religious. It may come as a surprise to those who
consign religion to some sort of social ghetto, but you can enjoy a
drink, a laugh and a romp and still be religious. Teddy is an
(itals)Irish(unitals) Catholic. And just as Robert Frost urged Jack
to remain more Irish than Harvard, so has Teddy held on to the life
preserver of religious faith by combining it with Gaelic verve.
He's done that through thick and thin, and there's been plenty of
thick and not a whole lot of thin.
</P>
<P>
   Frequent Mass, personal relationships with forward- looking
clerics, constant alignment of political goals with religious
teaching, all these anchor Teddy firmly in the safe harbor first
constructed for the little boy by Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, Catholic
to the core. Old Joe was a rogue in many ways, but Rose was deeply
religious, and Teddy was her little boy. It took with Teddy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's his wife. Victoria Reggie Kennedy has been good for
Teddy, for his equanimity, his peace of mind, and his darker
moments. They hold hands in public, talk frankly in private, and
when it comes to the family present a united defence that is almost
impermeable. Then there's the job.
</P>
<P>
   More than once in this space I've mused about how good a Senate
you could create by drawing on the good people who have walked away
from the World's Most Exclusive Club, as it so clearly is not, but
which it is often called.
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell, Warren Rudman, Bill Bradley, Al Simpson, David
Pryor, John Danforth, Mike Mansfield, Bill Cohen, all walked away
from the Senate. The upper branch's role, reputation, and rules
make it seem ridiculous in recent years, and the impeachment
debacle diminished it further. But Teddy endures. Plugging away.
Battling for the poor, the immigrants, those without health
insurance or a living wage. In American politics, Teddy defines the
left. Where he draws the line is where liberalism makes its stand.
His word is rock solid. As ostracized, denigrated, and castigated
as he has been, he's still the champion of heavy-lifting in a
Senate long on show horses and short on work horses.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his clout, seniority, know-how, and ability over four
decades to attract top-rank staff, Teddy can deliver. In the
business of getting to 51, he can not only count, but exert a
magnetic attraction, on conservative Republicans as well as fellow
Democrats. In the US Senate, Teddy is open for business, and he's
all business.
</P>
<P>
   His appetite for work is gargantuan. His name is on tons of
legislation since he bested Eddie McCormack in that
rock-'em-sock-'em primary 37 years ago. McCormack had more claim on
the seat, in terms of experience. But one of Teddy's brothers was
president, the other attorney general, and his old man was loaded.
Nowadays they live for soft money; in those days it was hard cash.
But the net effect was the same. If you've been rich, and you've
been poor, rich is better, in politics as in life.
</P>
<P>
   He's labor's guy, health care's man, and the tribune of the
Great Unwashed. When he ran committees, he could schedule hearings
that dented the consciousness of those in charge of the evening
news. Teddy brought TV cameras to hearing rooms and issues that
would have gone otherwise unremarked. It's the work that brings him
back to every fresh session: flogging staff, cajoling colleagues,
taking on opposing interests, campaigning for like-minded
Democrats, propping up or sparring with the Clinton crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He's good at it. He knows it's important. It gives meaning and
focus to his life. They flay him merciclessly on Sunbelt radio, in
the Wall Street suites, and wherever Republicans gather. But in
Massachusetts, he's Senator For Life. Come September, after yet
another public burial of a close relative, he'll be back at the
same old stand. Put it all together, and that's how Teddy copes:
faith, family, and fighting the good fight for the underdog.

TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD KEEPS AN EYE ON THE BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The Texas National Guard is moving ahead with
the controversial policy of using armed patrols to spy on drug
traffickers along the Mexican border, even though the U.S. military
suspended such patrols two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The armed, combat-ready patrols aren't authorized to make
arrests or interrogate civilians, but they are being deployed
throughout the state, including two missions along the Rio Grande
this year, said Aaron Reed, a spokesman for the Texas adjutant
general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys do not make busts. What we mainly do is provide
support and intelligence to civilian law enforcement agencies,''
Reed said from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The around-the-clock missions, which last for up to 30 days, are
carried out by specially trained reconnaissance teams of
active-duty personnel based in Austin and Houston, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   The teams hide in the brush and gather intelligence for the FBI,
Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs Service and the Texas
Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are always authorized to carry weapons. Whether they do
so is up to the mission and the threat assessment,'' Reed said. He
would not discuss where the teams have been deployed along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out there to protect our neighborhoods and our
children,'' Reed said. ``If we stop drugs at the border or shut
down a crack house in a city or help sheriffs locate and destroy a
field of marijuana, we know those drugs won't make it into our
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department suspended similar patrols carried out by
the Army and Marine Corps shortly after a Marine patrol shot dead a
civilian in May 1997, near the village of Redford in western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Esequiel Hernandez Jr., 18, was hit once in the rib cage by a
single M-16 round fired by a Marine corporal. The Navy Department,
which oversees the Marine Corps, eventually paid the man's family
$1.9 million to settle a wrongful death claim.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard operates independent of Joint Task Force 6,
the El Paso-based outfit that coordinates military and civilian law
enforcement operations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Border Patrol doesn't use the National Guard patrols
and has said it no longer will use armed military assistance of any
kind. The Marines were assisting the Border Patrol at the time of
the Hernandez shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said there were no plans to return troops
to the border and that National Guard operations were conducted at
the discretion of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although the National Guard has been used for patrol missions
along the border for more than 10 years, it was news to supporters
and critics of using the military along the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot afford to have armed patrols in, around, or near
communities on the border. We cannot risk it as a democratic
society or for our personnel safety and that of our families,''
said Nathan Selzer, a spokesman for the Immigration Law Enforcement
Monitoring Project in Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of a House Judiciary Committee
immigration panel, said the National Guard patrols are needed to
make up for insufficient numbers of Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful that the Texas National Guard is effectively
doing, in a backup capacity, what the Pentagon is no longer able to
do at the border,'' said Smith, R-Texas.

TWO TRAGEDIES, ONE RESULT: DEVASTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps this is an awkward time to make the connection.
</P>
<P>
   When the nation's cup of compassion overflows for the families
of John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife and sister-in-law, it may seem
insensitive to bring up another recent tragic airplane accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the similarities between the Kennedy crash last
week and that of American Airlines Flight 1420 at Little Rock
National Airport on June 1 are striking.
</P>
<P>
   The preponderance of speculation in the Kennedy mishap suggests
that a relatively inexperienced amateur pilot, in a hurry to get to
an important family event, exhibited poor judgment in attempting a
flight over water at night under challenging weather conditions and
become disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment, suggesting recklessness, cannot help but add to
the pain being experienced by the grieving families.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they can take some solace from knowing that such errors
of judgment are not exclusive to inexperienced, amateur pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The preponderance of speculation about the Flight 1420 accident
suggests strongly that a very experienced commercial airline pilot
exhibited flawed judgment in attempting to land the aircraft during
a severe thunderstorm, after being warned of deteriorating weather
conditions at the airport and being given two wind-shear alerts.
</P>
<P>
   One investigator speculated that the pilot may have become
caught up in ``get-home-itis,'' a compulsion to complete a flight
regardless of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is just speculation, because the investigation
is not complete. But it is very credible speculation. Investigators
have said that the causes of the accident will be among the easiest
in aviation history to pinpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Like the families of Kennedy and his wife and sister-in-law, the
relatives and friends of the 11 people killed in crash of Flight
1420 still mourn for their losses. And the families will not derive
much comfort from the industrial-strength financial settlements
they will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will those who were permanently injured and scared in the
break-up of the plane and its accompanying fires be healed
completely by money. But that is the best balm available.
</P>
<P>
   With the expiration of the federally mandated, one-month waiting
period during which lawyers are prohibited from contacting people
who were passengers of a crashed airliner or their families,
lawsuits are beginning to be filed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, prominent Dallas attorney Frank Branson
filed a suit in Little Rock against American Airlines on behalf of
injured passenger Nancy Chu. In that lawsuit, Branson alleges that
the airline violated federal laws that prohibit ``the careless and
reckless operation of an aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to describing Chu's physical injuries, Branson also
refers to her ``mental anguish.'' That's an interesting point,
because the psychological injury might be even worse than the
physical ones.
</P>
<P>
   Money won't neutralize the bad dreams and flashbacks that could
result from such a close call with death. Even passengers who
suffered no significant physical injuries could carry such
psychological scars for years.
</P>
<P>
   The $25,000 checks that the airline sent to all the passengers
of Flight 1420, or their families in the cases of deceased victims,
won't come close to compensating for that kind of lingering
ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, money is not a factor in the latest Kennedy tragedy.
The families don't need it, and there is no liability to be
assigned. Perhaps the crash was the consequence of poor judgment.
Or maybe it was just fate.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Kennedy family, of course, have more experience
than most in dealing with the mental anguish that comes from the
sudden, premature death of a loved one. Perhaps they and the family
of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren Bessette, can
draw some comfort from knowing that most of the national outpouring
of sympathy for them at this grim time is genuine.

Service for AMs of Saturday, July 24.
</P>

   &UR; KENNEDY &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-RDP (New York) _ The memorial service for John F.

   &UR; OTHER NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-SCHOOL (Los Angeles) _ It is a classic Los Angeles tale of
sunny civic boosterism and noir real estate speculation. Built atop
an abandoned oil field, despite repeated red flags and warnings,
the Belmont Learning Center, which would be the most expensive
public high school ever, may never be finished - and if it is, no
one may want to go to school there. The problem: officials say
there may be no way to vent away seeping methane gas and other
hazards to make it safe enough to occupy. This week, the newly
elected majority of the Los Angeles Board of Education voted to
create a special commission to recommend whether to abandon the
more than $200 million project, after $125 million has already been
spent, or spend millions more in an effort to make it work. By Todd
S. Purdum.

assault.

have risen moderately in the summer driving season, continuing an
upward trend that began earlier in the year as oil-producing
nations cut back supplies. By Agis Salpukas.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-ARMOR (Sao Paulo) _ While Brazil's elite remain
relatively well-off in a stagnant economy, large swaths of society
are struggling. And perhaps no trend better illustrates the strain
placed on Brazilian society than the recent surge in car armoring.
This is especially true in urban centers like Sao Paulo, where
unemployment is at a record high. Representatives from car-armoring
companies say the market for such vehicles is expected to rise 60
percent this year, to $70 million. By Simon Romero.

   HAPPINESS (Undated) _ The secret to happiness, it turns out, may
not be wealth or power. Or love or success or faithful friendship.
Or Ray Charles crooning ``Georgia on My Mind'' or even chocolate
mousse. Finding happiness may mean going no further than your very
own forehead _ the left prefrontal cortex of your brain, to be
exact. The more the sparks fly from this sliver of gray matter, the
more electrical impulses it generates, the happier you are.
Researchers are beginning to use gene mapping, brain imaging and
scientific surveys to understand what makes people happy. By Pam
Belluck. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   ROMAN-DEMOCRACY (Undated) _ To most historians of this century,
the Roman republic was seen as a corrupt oligarchy ruled by a rich
and decadent aristocracy, despite its democratic constitution,
popular assemblies and regularly elected officials. Yet several

   OPERA-RESURRECTION (Undated) _ Resurrection from the dead may be
the most universal of mythic ideas: a devoted savior descends to
the netherworld to restore a loved one to life. But there is always
a price to be paid: natural law is rarely overturned without
penalty and pain. Persephone must return to Hades. This myth is
also at the heart of two 400-year-old operas. In the Chinese opera,
``The Peony Pavilion,'' the slightly cocky young scholar Liu
Mengmei brings his beloved bac to life. And in Monteverdi's
``Orfeo,'' Orpheus, whose playing of the lyre could wring tears
from stones, uses his music to rescue his Eurydice from Hades. By

ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEEK LABELS ON `DIRTY GAS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Chevron Corp., which received permission
from state regulators to sell a limited amount of gasoline that
does not conform to California's stringent air standards, has been
asked by environmentalists to label the ``dirty gas'' at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based oil company, which has not yet had to
sell non-conforming gas despite tight supplies, said it would take
the request under advisement.
</P>
<P>
   The request was made by the Citizens for a Better Environment, a
San Francisco-based environmental organization that said consumers
``have a right to know'' if they are paying for ``dirty gas from
out of state.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Air Resources Board on July 15 granted Chevron a
variance under the 1996 Clean Air Act after production problems at
the company's Richmond refinery became so severe that output was
greatly reduced. An explosion July 10, although posing no danger to
neighbors, cut production at the Richmond facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Resources Board limited sales of non-conforming gas to
147 million gallons for 45 days, beginning July 16, in Northern
California and the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Chevron has been able to find adequate supplies of
California-quality gas on the spot market, where many independent
gas retailers buy supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Gas sold in California cuts hydrocarbon emissions about 17
percent, while gas from other states cuts emissions by about 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens for a Better Environment, or CBE, on Thursday
proposed that a label be placed on all pumps selling gasoline that
does not meet state standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California Air Resources Board is setting a terrible
precedent by caving in to Chevron,'' said Denny Larson, the CBE
director in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now every refinery will want to follow this new policy of
`blow-up, cover-up and jack-up their prices.' Consumers and
refinery neighbors are both the victims of this latest disaster,''
Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gorell, a spokesman for Chevron, said: ``The fact is we
have not sold even one gallon of gas that does not meet California
cleaner-burning gas specifications. We hope to continue along that
path. In the meantime, we do appreciate the CBE suggestion, and we
will take it under advisement.''
</P>
<P>
   CBE also asked the Air Resources Board to label any
non-conforming gas being sold. A board spokesman, Alan Hirsch, said
that would not be done because ``there is no requirement in our
variance requirement to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Chevron is obligated to report to the board any
non-conforming gas sold. The state also will charge Chevron a
penalty of 15 cents per gallon on non-conforming gas, or up to $22
million.

   HAPPINESS (Undated) _ The secret to happiness, it turns out, may
not be wealth or power. Or love or success or faithful friendship.
Or Ray Charles crooning ``Georgia on My Mind'' or even chocolate
mousse. Finding happiness may mean going no further than your very
own forehead _ the left prefrontal cortex of your brain, to be
exact. The more the sparks fly from this sliver of gray matter, the
more electrical impulses it generates, the happier you are.
Researchers are beginning to use gene mapping, brain imaging and
scientific surveys to understand what makes people happy. By Pam
Belluck. (1800 words)

<P>
   ROMAN-DEMOCRACY (Undated) _ To most historians of this century,
the Roman republic was seen as a corrupt oligarchy ruled by a rich
and decadent aristocracy, despite its democratic constitution,
popular assemblies and regularly elected officials. Yet several
scholars have been nibbling away at Republican Rome's undemocratic
reputation, arguing that it was an imperfect but still recognizable
democracy. Political office was less controlled by the aristocracy
than assumed. What's more, they say, in some ways, Rome had even
more in common with modern notions of democracy than Athens,
revered as the birthplace of a purer show-of-hands democracy. By

 &HT;    CLINTON A POWERFUL ASSET FOR GORE, HILLARY CAMPAIGNS
 &HT;    720&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories
for release Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS and SCOTT SHEPARD

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was the sort of event presidents dream of: the
chance to be seen by the whole country, on the White House lawn,
with three American heroes on the 30th anniversary of the boldest
scientific adventure in history.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was Vice President Al Gore who got to present Apollo
11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins with
medals and accolades last Tuesday, three decades after Armstrong
became the first man to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Just the day before, it was first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
who stole the show when the White House honored another set of
American heroes: the World Cup champion women's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   As both Gore and Mrs. Clinton step from the president's shadow
to pursue their own ambitions, Clinton has begun a new and
unfamiliar career as a supporting actor on the political stage.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore campaigning to succeed him, and Mrs. Clinton weighing
a run for the U.S. Senate, Clinton is being asked to raise campaign
money, use his speaking appearances to sound campaign themes and
take jabs at Republicans, and share the White House spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has made it very clear that he will do
everything he can to make sure that Vice President Gore is the next
president of the United States,'' said Chris Lehane, the vice
president's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's activity is unprecedented. First, no president has
ever been asked to help his wife win a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   And until Clinton, modern presidents of both parties have waited
until their vice presidents have won their party's nomination
before weighing in with an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never happened before,'' Bill Bradley, the former New
Jersey senator who is Gore's only rival for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 2000, said last week. ``But the vice
president has been a loyal supporter of the president through thick
and thin, bad times and good. So I guess it's understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton's activity is a way to repay a political debt to
two people who stuck by him through the darkest days of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do whatever I'm asked to do, basically,'' Clinton told
reporters during a White House press conference on Wednesday. ``I
owe them a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's role in supporting Gore begins in earnest early next
month, when the Democratic Party's all-time champion fund raiser
travels to Little Rock, Ark., for the first of five scheduled
events to collect money for the vice president's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is also leaning on Clinton, though less formally, for
advice and ideas. ``He's one of the smartest and savviest political
thinkers there is,'' Lehane said of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president has also begun taking high-profile pot shots at
the Republican presidential front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, lampooning his self-styled ``compassionate conservatism'' as
too conservative to vote for gun controls, but compassionate enough
to feel badly about it afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just having a little fun,'' Clinton later said of the
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   And yet his point was clear, and Gore kept his hands clean of
anything resembling negative politicking.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the vice president can count on working with Clinton on
popular issues, to the benefit of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane described the coordinated effort as a ``one-two punch,''
or, in wrestling terms, a ``tag team.''
</P>
<P>
   It works this way: two weeks ago, Gore proposed new gun
controls. Two days later, the president publicly endorsed Gore's
approach. The next day, Clinton met at the White House with high
school students lobbying for gun controls while Gore was in New
York applauding the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People's decision to sue gun manufacturers. Gore then
returned to Washington for his own meeting with the high school
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the president is doing is putting out the partisan red
meat for Al and Hillary and the rest of the Democratic Party to
chew on,'' said Dick Morris, who has been one of Clinton's top
political advisers on and off for nearly two decades. ``At the same
time, he's trying to cut deals with the Republican leaders of
Congress on important legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The White House provides a dramatic stage for casting candidate
Gore in a presidential light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost gives Gore the power of incumbency,'' said Mary
Stuckey, associate professor of political science at the University
of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he is stepping into Clinton's ceremonial shoes,'' she
said, ``stepping into his policy shoes after that, for some, won't
seem that big of a reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Clinton on his side, though, isn't a pure advantage for
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Pew Research Center in Washington found
that American voters are feeling a ``Clinton fatigue'' that is
hindering Gore's attempt to become only the second sitting vice
president in this century to be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was dragging the nation through a year-long
impeachment process, the thought of him as a political asset to
anyone except his opponents seemed remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, many people were openly speculating whether Al
Gore would be an incumbent,'' observed John Murphy, associate
professor of speech communications at the University of Georgia.
``Now, he's working on escaping the shadow of Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's response has been to try to position himself as the heir
to Clinton's populist agenda _ with its emphasis on such baby
boomer issues as Social Security, Medicare, education and crime _
and to attach himself to the president's foreign policy successes
and to the policies underlying one of the strongest American
economies in history.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore has gone to lengths to distance himself
from Clinton's moral lapses, squarely placing his own squeaky-clean
reputation at the center of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will take my own values of faith and family to the
presidency, to build an America that is not only better off, but
better,'' Gore said in the speech declaring his candidacy last
month in Carthage, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Further driving home the point, Gore added, ``So today, I say to
every parent in America: it is our own lives we must master if we
are to have the moral authority to guide our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's role in the Gore campaign is only beginning to emerge,
but he's already previewed the basic message he'll take to the
public as he works to get Gore elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had far more responsibility and gotten more done than any
vice president in history,'' said Clinton. ``I don't think the
American people know that yet, but I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The political calculus concerning his wife _ should she opt to
run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring veteran
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. _ could be more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, though, Clinton claims to be eager to work on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can help her in any way, I will,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a great thing for the country, not only
because of what I owe her,'' he said. ``It's very unusual to find
somebody like that who has that much knowledge and background and
passion all packed into one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left no doubt that he was willing to back those claims
on the stump, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you think I'm a biased observer,'' he said, ``but
I think I could support it with evidence.''

   Once again, though, Clinton claims to be eager to work on her
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can help her in any way, I will,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a great thing for the country, not only
because of what I owe her,'' he said. ``It's very unusual to find
somebody like that who has that much knowledge and background and
passion all packed into one place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left no doubt that he was willing to back those claims
on the stump, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you think I'm a biased observer,'' he said, ``but
I think I could support it with evidence.''

JUDGES CONSIDER MERITS OF SUIT AGAINST GUN MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ State Court of Appeal judges on Thursday had
harsh words for the manufacturer of the high-performance TEC-DC9
pistol that was used to kill eight people in a San Francisco office
building six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But their apparent distaste for the assault weapon did not stop
the judges from seriously questioning whether a negligence lawsuit
against the gun manufacturer belongs in a court of law.
</P>
<P>
   The families of several shooting victims sued Navegar Inc. in
1994, claiming that the manufacturer irresponsibly distributed a
weapon that was designed solely to kill humans.
</P>
<P>
   The case was thrown out just before the trial in 1997, when a
Superior Court judge found that Navegar hadn't violated any state
laws. Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed, and are asking the
three-judge panel to send the case back to trial.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-hour hearing, presiding Justice Anthony Kline's
questioning became critical when referring to Navegar
advertisements that tout the ability to keep fingerprints off the
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they do such a thing, if they weren't trying to
appeal to a criminal clientele?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Navegar lawyer Ernest Jetto defended the wording in the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not have sounded innocent, but it was,'' Jetto said.
</P>
<P>
   Kline later mocked the gun manufacturer, after Jetto suggested
that the gun could be used for ``plinking,'' the so-called sport of
shooting at cans and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd want a flash suppressor and silencer when you're out in
your back yard plinking with a TEC-DC9?'' Kline said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices made it clear, however, that the plaintiffs need to
do more than argue that the TEC-DC9 is a bad gun.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Henigan, the lawyer who argued the case for the
plaintiffs, was asked repeatedly to justify his clients' suing over
a product that was not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware that any court in this country has ever held
that a product that was legally sold to the public was negligently
sold to the public,'' Kline told Henigan.
</P>
<P>
   The court of appeal panel is scheduled to return with a written
decision within 60 days. If the judges overturn the lower court
ruling, the case will go back to trial later this year, Henigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs claim the ``faulty design'' of the gun led to its
criminal misuse by Gian Luigi Ferri, a mortgage banker who killed
eight people and wounded six others in the high-rise office
building at 101 California St.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments come three days after Gov. Gray Davis signed into
law a bill that will help restrict the manufacture and sale of
assault weapons, including the TEC-DC9.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 friends and family members of the victims, including
several who were wounded in the 1993 shooting, attended the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things I've done since my wife was murdered, what I'm
for, is making changes to make the nation safe for my daughter and
her generation,'' said Steve Sposato, one of the plaintiffs. ``I
ask what Navegar is for.''

</P>
<P>
   CALIF-SCHOOL (Los Angeles) _ It is a classic Los Angeles tale of
sunny civic boosterism and noir real estate speculation. Built atop
an abandoned oil field, despite repeated red flags and warnings,
the Belmont Learning Center, which would be the most expensive
public high school ever, may never be finished - and if it is, no
one may want to go to school there. The problem: officials say
there may be no way to vent away seeping methane gas and other
hazards to make it safe enough to occupy. This week, the newly
elected majority of the Los Angeles Board of Education voted to
create a special commission to recommend whether to abandon the
more than $200 million project, after $125 million has already been
spent, or spend millions more in an effort to make it work. By Todd
S. Purdum.

nations cut back supplies. By Agis Salpukas.

   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-ARMOR (Sao Paulo) _ While Brazil's elite remain
relatively well-off in a stagnant economy, large swaths of society
are struggling. And perhaps no trend better illustrates the strain
placed on Brazilian society than the recent surge in car armoring.
This is especially true in urban centers like Sao Paulo, where
unemployment is at a record high. Representatives from car-armoring
companies say the market for such vehicles is expected to rise 60
percent this year, to $70 million. By Simon Romero.

</P>
<P>
   Except for political junkies, most people can tell you precisely
one thing about George W. Bush: His father used to be president. No
wonder he's in major-league denial when asked about matching
Poppy's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm not
really thrilled about talking about,'' he told The New York Times,
revealing, in a classic Freudian protestation, more than he
realized.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be impossible for anyone in Bush's shoes not to
bear an especially heavy Oedipal burden. The life of the only son
of a president to become president--John Quincy Adams--illustrates
why.
</P>
<P>
   W. has followed in his father's footsteps by attending Phillips
Academy and Yale, getting into the oil business, running for
Congress, and now, seeking the presidency. ``JQA'' (as he was
called to distinguish him from Dad) had the more daunting task of
succeeding his father--the nation's first vice president and second
president, and an eminent political theorist--as one of the great
statesmen of the early republic.
</P>
<P>
   If W. were to learn even a little about JQA's unhappy plight, he
might well realize the virtues of psychological self-analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The senior John Adams was a leader in the American Revolution
and wrote the influential tracts ``Thoughts on Government'' and
``Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States
of America.'' He saw no reason his eldest son, born in 1767,
shouldn't attain equal greatness. Adams set a rigorous course of
study for young John, assigning him, for example, to read
Thucydides' ``History of the Peloponnesian War'' in the original
Greek, at age 10.
</P>
<P>
   Morally stern, Adams also admonished his son to make ``a good
account'' of himself, and continued to hector him well into his
adulthood. ``You come into life with advantages which will disgrace
you if your success is mediocre,'' Adams wrote to the 27-year-old
JQA in 1794. ``If you do not rise to the head not only of your
profession but of your country, it will be owing to your own
Laziness, Slovenliness and Obstinacy.''
</P>
<P>
   JQA didn't need his father's entreaties to work hard. He had
internalized them fully, and his copious diary entries reveal
neurotically high ambitions and an obsessional level of
self-reproach for not meeting them. ``Indolence, indolence, I fear,
will be my ruin,'' he wrote at age 20, voicing a refrain he
repeated throughout his hard-working life.
</P>
<P>
   At that same young age, he awoke one morning with a hangover
after a night spent caroling with friends, during which, he
recorded, ``the bottle went round with an unusual rapidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his self-flagellation, JQA learned self-control
early. It took George W. Bush 39 years and many more hangovers
before he learned the same. Of course, JQA's paternally instilled
perfectionism sparked a lifelong case of clinical depression. W.'s
growing-up experiences sparked a born-again Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   JQA benefited as well as suffered from his father's position.
Where George Herbert Walker Bush furnished his son with contacts in
politics and in the oil business, John Adams extended to his son
equally rare opportunities. As a boy, JQA accompanied Adams on a
diplomatic mission to Paris and, through that experience, won the
assignment, at age 14, to be secretary and interpreter on another
assignment in St. Petersburg, in Russia. These jobs primed JQA for
his later diplomatic career.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as the intellectually undistinguished George W.
doubtless got into Yale as a ``legacy,'' JQA, though he had
mastered Thucydides, surely wasn't penalized for his father's name
when he was admitted to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   For JQA's earliest intellectual triumphs, too, Adams senior was
at least inadvertently responsible. At age 24, JQA wrote his first
major work of political philosophy, in the manner of many works
then, under a classical pseudonym, ``Publicola.'' A rejoinder to
Tom Paine's Rights of Man, ``Letters From Publicola'' emphasized
the role of passion, not reason, in governing men's political
behavior. Its conservative tone and polished style--compared
admiringly to Edmund Burke--led many to assume that John Adams had
authored it. The case of mistaken identity fed its popularity and
launched JQA's career as a political essayist.
</P>
<P>
   The episode stands as yet another eerie precursor to George W.'s
life: As a much-overlooked New York Times story noted last spring,
W. became the GOP front-runner largely because many people who told
pollsters they favored Bush were ``actually thinking of the
father''; the confusion triggered a virtuous cycle of high poll
numbers, improved fund-raising, and endorsements that has lifted W.
above the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, JQA came both to revere and to recoil from the
magnitude of his father's accomplishments. In a 1793 address, JQA
vowed that while ``the copious treasures'' of fame and achievement
``have already been gathered by the hands of genius,'' he and his
generation would still stay true to ``the precious memory of the
sages.'' Though he was ostensibly paying tribute to the
Constitution, it was not hard to hear the deep filiopietism beneath
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, JQA struggled to stake out his own terrain as
a lawyer or, his ultimate fantasy, a poet. Naturally awed by his
father's achievements, he swore he didn't want a career in politics
(again, not unlike the way W. pursued business after failing to get
elected to Congress at age 31). Yet no sooner had Adams undertaken
his pursuits as an attorney than his father, recently elected as
the nation's first vice president, informed him that George
Washington had named the young man minister to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The news dashed JQA's hopes for independence from Dad. ``I wish
I could have been consulted before it was irrevocably made,'' he
said of the appointment. ``I rather wish it had not been made at
all.'' The senior Adams, meanwhile, took the occasion to chide his
son to start paying attention to how he dressed.
</P>
<P>
   When John Adams became president in 1797, he appointed his son
to the even more prestigious post of minister to Prussia. In both
diplomatic missions, JQA received laudatory reviews, and he was
marked as an important leader in his own right. It could only have
served as a painful reminder of his father's still-greater fame,
then, when, after losing the election of 1800 to Thomas Jefferson,
Adams recalled his son so as not to give his rival the satisfaction
of deciding whether JQA should continue in his post.
</P>
<P>
   Following his career as a diplomat, John Quincy went on to
ascend ever higher in politics. He served as a Massachusetts state
senator and a U.S. senator, and then, during James Monroe's
presidency, as secretary of state, where he was largely responsible
for formulating the principles behind the Monroe Doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced in what was then clearly the No. 2 position in
government, JQA was the presumptive front-runner in the 1824
presidential race, though it was Andrew Jackson who won a plurality
(yet not the necessary majority) of electoral votes. Adams won the
presidency only because Henry Clay backed him in the run-off in the
House of Representatives, but Adams never lived down (false) rumors
that he and Clay had cut a ``Corrupt Bargain.'' He unwisely fed the
rumors and harmed his own reputation by naming Clay his secretary
of state.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Adams' relatively unremarkable presidency, however, he
rebounded as no other ex-president ever has. He ran for Congress
from Massachusetts and, revitalized, served for 18 years--notably
helping to overturn the shameful ``gag rule'' that forbade the
reading of anti-slavery petitions on the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   It takes little imagination to speculate that JQA felt liberated
to enjoy this second career only because on July 4, 1826, midway
through JQA's presidency, his venerated old man passed away.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of JQA's life is that, for all his spectacular
achievements, he was doomed to feel inadequate next to his
larger-than-life father. W. should only have such problems.

 &HT;    MORE PUBLIC SAFETY PLANNING NEEDED FOR Y2K EVE, OFFICIALS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police and fire fighters are making ``tremendous
progress'' toward stamping out Y2K computer bugs, but they still
need to make contingency plans to handle the ``multiple events''
that could inflict harm on the public just after midnight Jan. 1,
the top federal official on the issue said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local communities need to prepare for the possibility of
Y2K-related failures that could place an added burden on public
safety systems and personnel,'' John Koskinen, chairman of the
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials should be planning now,'' he said, for ``whatever
surprises the date change may bring.''
</P>
<P>
   The night of Dec. 31 will present public safety workers with
``unique challenges'' because people may be massing in the streets
or piling into parties to celebrate the year 2000. That could mean
traffic jams and increased drunk driving at a time of year when bad
weather is common.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, many computers are likely to malfunction because
of the computer software flaw widely known as the Y2K bug. The
glitch will cause some older computers to interpret dates ending in
``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000. That simple misunderstanding has
the potential to shut down the computerized systems that control
power generators, telecommunications systems, traffic lights, alarm
systems and more.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen was joined by representatives of police, fire
protection and corrections organizations. Friday's message was
generally optimistic, but the speakers could not guarantee that
every public safety system will be ready for the date change.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for examples of what kinds of computer failures might
occur and what public workers would do to cope, the officials gave
these examples:
</P>
<P>
   At a prison, the computerized cameras that allow guards to
monitor inmates could go dark. Contingency plans would call for
off-duty guards to return to work to watch prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Prison doors will not unlock at midnight, as some rumors have
suggested, because those automated systems have manual overrides
that will be operated by the extra workers on duty that night, said
William Taylor, representing the American Correctional Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``All (prison) facilities will experience some difficulties''
because of Y2K bugs, he predicted, but when the jailhouse doors
``won't open.''
</P>
<P>
   At the police station, computerized systems for taking in
information about arrested suspects might fail, forcing officers to
record information with paper and pen. Fingerprints can be recorded
in ink, as they were for decades before computers came along.
</P>
<P>
   Officers are fully capable to arresting, processing and jailing
people without the help of computers, but ``it just takes a little
longer,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He urged all public safety officials to rehearse using paper,
pen and human labor in case computers shut down, and urged them to
practice sharing resources across city, county and state lines to
cope with multiple, simultaneous emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of Jan. 1, ``a lot of different things could
be going on,'' he said, and the question safety workers have to
ponder for the next five months is ``how can we cooperate'' to
limit any damage from those events.

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Each is listed among baseball's top 100
players of the century.
</P>
<P>
   One has the most strikeouts and no-hitters in pitching history,
one is the only player to win batting titles in three different
decades, and the other is one of only three players to win Most
Valuable Player awards at two different positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount left the game together
after the 1993 season. On Sunday, along with four Veterans
Committee selections _ including Orlando Cepeda _ they will enter
into immortality together, taking their rightful places in the
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tremendous class, one that has three players _ Ryan,
Brett and Yount _ gaining acceptance into the Hall in their first
year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Only the 1936 class _ the Hall of Fame's first _ had as many as
three first-ballot inductees.
</P>
<P>
   But where does this year's Hall class rank in baseball lore? The
debate started when the votes were announced in January, and the
din hasn't subsided since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great class,'' said Jerome Holtzman, a former
Chicago Tribune columnist who now is the official historian for
Major League Baseball. ``But people lose sight of the fact that
this isn't the greatest class of them all. The first class, that
was a pretty good class.''
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural Hall of Fame class was composed of Ty Cobb, Honus
Wagner, Babe Ruth, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson, names that
have forever been synonymous with baseball greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Baseball Writers Association of America had
several legends to choose from in 1936, and several notables _
511-game winner Cy Young being the best among them _ did not make
that first cut.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, Wagner, Ruth, Mathewson and Johnson combined to be named
on 1,046 of a possible 1,130 ballots, or 92.56 percent. In that
regard, the Class of '99 holds its own, as Ryan, Brett and Yount
were tabbed on 1,364 of 1,491 ballots (91.48 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Ryan finished with the second-strongest vote total in history
and Brett the fourth. It was only the 10th time in the 55 elections
held by veteran members of the Baseball Writers Association of
America that as many as three players were enshrined in the same
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzman said he doesn't see why the debate _ particularly one
that can't have a resolution _ is necessary. In his eyes, every
Hall of Fame class is on a pedestal, with no real tiers separating
levels of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're all good,'' Holtzman said. ``I wouldn't
compare it to the '36 class, but it's one of the best. I don't
think you have to differentiate. It's one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be no debate about that as a crowd of more than 40,000
is expected in Cooperstown when Ryan, Brett, Yount and Veterans
Committee selections Cepeda, Nestor Chylak, Frank Selee and Joe
Williams become enshrined in an induction ceremony on the grounds
of the Clark Sports Center.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon, now the manager of the Cincinnati Reds, had both
Brett and Cepeda play for him during their careers. He expressed
some disbelief that some writers did not vote for Brett or Ryan
(both were named on more than 98 percent of all ballots, but fell
short of being the first to be selected unanimously), and said this
year's class is the best in many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a good one,'' McKeon said. ``I feel very, very
blessed that I managed two of the four.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Kachline, who was the historian at the Hall of Fame for
14 years and also was a staff member for 24 years at the Sporting
News, will see his 31st induction ceremony at the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The first induction Kachline saw was the Class of 1969, which
included Veterans Committee inductees Waite Hoyt and Stan
Coveleski, along with writers' choices Roy Campanella and Stan
Musial.
</P>
<P>
   Kachline said that although this is one of the top classes in
Cooperstown history, he doesn't consider it No. 1 on his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is one of them, but I'm very partial to the first
one (1936) and the first one I saw,'' said Kachline, who lives just
a mile outside of Cooperstown. ``That made a great impression on
me. I followed Musial very closely when we lived in St. Louis. That
certainly was quite a group, too. Musial, obviously, is one of the
great players of all time, and Campanella is likewise.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn, a sure bet to be elected
to the Hall of Fame one day, has studied baseball history for
years.
</P>
<P>
   He never saw the original inductees play, of course, and said
that is why he can't draw a fair comparison of the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one might be the greatest of all time, but this one
is really good,'' Gwynn said. ``There are really great people in
this class going in: Nolan Ryan, Brett, Yount, Orlando Cepeda. I
didn't have an opportunity to talk to the first class, but I know
these guys (1999 class) have been just great to me whenever I've
had dealings with them. And those are the types of things I
remember. I'm really happy for all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, of course, will continue. And that's part of the
sparkle of Cooperstown, part of what makes the Hall so hallowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genius of the Hall of Fame is that it is plugged into the
very center of a debate that we all enjoy having,'' said baseball
historian Bill James, ``and that's really what makes the place
work.''

 This ``separate buy'' article is from Latin Trade magazine,
America's leading journal of Latin American business, finance and
trade: &HT;    THE UNITED STATE OF MEXICO. South of the border, companies are
turning the country's $420 billion economy into a major cog in the

 By BRENDAN M. CASE 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ If you live in the United States, look closely at
the gas range in your kitchen. While the brand may be as American
as General Electric or Kenmore, odds are one in three that the
stove was made in Mexico. And there's a one-in-five chance that the
mini-refrigerator in the corner is also made south of the border.
Rafael Nava, spokesperson for Mabe, the Mexican manufacturer that
produces both appliances, says rather modestly, ``North America is
like one market for us.''
 &HT;    While all eyes are on the McDonaldization of Mexico, the country
is quietly emerging as an industrial power that manufactures many
of the goods that compose the fabric of American life. The trend
started in the mid-1980s with mere assembly lines along the
2,000-mile border, but the unprecedented union between a developing
and developed economy is now moving into new territory much farther
south. Multinational companies operating in Mexico as well as local
conglomerates are turning the country's US$ 420 billion economy
into a vital part of the vastly larger $7.2 trillion U.S. market.
 &HT;    ``What we're seeing is the advanced stages of industrial
integration between the U.S. and Mexico,'' says Raul Hinojosa,
director of the North American Integration and Development Center
at the University of California at Los Angeles. What is most
evident is that Mexico is being swallowed whole. More than a third
of the country's entire economy consists of trade with its northern
neighbor, and talk abounds of one day even adopting the dollar as
official currency.
 &HT;    Not so obvious is that Mexico is now the number two U.S. trade
partner after Canada, and total bilateral trade has tripled since
the start of the decade to almost $196 billion in 1998. It trades
more manufactured goods with the United States than Japan and more
textiles with the United States than China. Mexico supplies the
United States with its Chrysler minivans, IBM Thinkpads and
Whirlpool refrigerators.
 &HT;    ``What industrial integration means on the ground is that any
closure of the production chain in one country is likely to disrupt
production in the other country,'' says Hinojosa. ``We saw that
with the General Motors strike last year in the U.S. that stopped
work in plants across Mexico.''
 &HT;    When autoworkers walked off the job in Flint, Michigan in the
middle of last year, General Motors plants crawled to a halt in
Mexican cities such as Silao, Saltillo and Ciudad Juarez. The
eight-week strike idled almost all of GM's nearly 84,000 Mexican
workers. More remarkable still, the work stoppage would barely have
affected its operations south of the border as recently as 1986.
 &HT;    At that time, GM employed only 24,000 Mexican workers, and the
world's largest automaker had just transferred its entire
wire-harness operation to Ciudad Juarez, marking a new stage in the
two-decade-old program for in-bond assembly plants, better known as
maquiladoras. Automakers and autoparts quickly transformed the
eastern border between Mexico and the United States into a massive
assembly center, while on the western frontier electronics firms
like Japan's Matsushita (formerly Panasonic) turned the TijuanaSan
Diego area into what is today the world's largest center for
television set production.
 &HT;    The maquila program continues to play a large role in total
bilateral trade, but the plants are no longer limited to the border
nor are they simply assembling parts. Today, managers in Detroit
and other automotive capitals now entrust Mexican plants with
manufacturing vehicles not just for Mexicans, but for customers in
the United States, Canada and beyond. Mexican-made vehicles are
crucial to car companies' global fortunes.
 &HT;    To wit: Ford makes its Escorts for North America in Hermosillo.
General Motors produces its Silverado model in Guanajuato. Chrysler
plants in Mexico churn out Ram Chargers and also minivans _ the
same minivans that are leading sales growth in the United States.
 &HT;    Then there's Volkswagen and its hot-selling New Beetle, which is
reviving the German company's U.S. sales. The site VW managers
chose for such a key product? Puebla. The plant there also cranks
out the latest Jetta, another popular model north of the border.
 &HT;    The automakers are attracting both foreign and Mexican
suppliers. Mexicto produce more than $13 billion in autoparts this
year, up 10 percent from last year _ and twice what it produced
just four years ago. And the automakers are not alone.
 &HT;    Patrick Martin, president of developing market operations
worldwide for Xerox, explains that multinationals and local
companies across the board are finding that Mexico is a very
competitive manufacturing site. ``When Mexico took down its trade
barriers in 1987, our Aguascalientes plant could not compete,''
says Martin, indicating that the firm's copier plant, like many
others, was set up to gain access to the protected Mexican market.
``Today, the plant is one of our largest and most productive in the
world.'' To get there, Xerox poured in $300 million.
 &HT;    Similarly, IBM now makes all its Thinkpads for North America in
Guadalajara, where Hewlett-Packard and Motorola aso have
manufacturing facilities.
 &HT;    Many Mexican firms like appliance-maker Mabe export, albeit
anonymously, to the United States too. In this way, the country has
become the largest exporter of textiles also to its northern
neighbor, displacing China.
 &HT;    Yet nobody recognizes brand names like those belonging to
Chihuahua-based Grupo Industrial Parras, a major denim
manufacturer, or perhaps even sees the discreet ``Made in Mexico''
label on women's underwear and synthetic fabrics.
 &HT;    Emboldened, many Mexican firms are venturing across the border
to establish distribution and their own brand names. Take Imsa, the
Monterrey-based steel company. When Eugenio Clariond Reyes became
chairman in the 1980s, the company barely exported anything. Last
year it shipped $865 million abroad on sales of $2 billion. Its
secret lies in dominating U.S. market niches.
 &HT;    Imsa is the second-largest manufacturer of steel staircases in
the world, and the largest foreign supplier to the United States.
It exported $1 million in staircases in 1993. It exported $190
million last year, much of it to the north. That's not all _ with
staircase plants in Texas and Arkansas, Middle America shares the
company's production with northern Mexico. Imsa is also a major
producer of steel panels, which it churns out from plants in
Monterrey and Tijuana, as well as in Texas and Virginia.
 &HT;    ``We had three employees in a Houston sales office in the early
1990s,'' said Clariond Reyes in a recent speech. ``Now we have 610
throughout the United States. Nafta is not a cure-all for Mexico,
but it is generating a new kind of relationship with the U.S.''
 &HT;    Similar stories abound. Big companies in both manufacturing and
services are looking to invest in the North. Dina, the bus and
truckmaker, even partially moved its headquarters to the United
States. After all, Dina's sales in Mexico fell by more than half
during the economic crisis of 1995, and it is now in the midst of
an emergency financial restructuring. But up north, where it owns
Motor Coach Industries, the leading manufacturer of long-distance
buses, Dina is thriving.
 &HT;    Typically, Mexican companies first view the U.S. market through
the lens of Latino customers. Gigante, the supermarket chain,
recently opened a store in East Los Angeles, where it aims to
exploit its familiarity with Mexican consumers.
 &HT;    Another big bet on the Latino market comes from Telefonos de
Mexico (Telmex). Telmex ditched former partner Sprint last May in
its bid to attract Hispanics to its long-distance service north of
the border. Now it plans to roll out its service with a new
partner, San Antonio-based SBC, although SBC _ formerly
Southwestern Bell _ is a Baby Bell with far less long-distance
experience than Sprint. Or, for that matter, Telmex.
 &HT;    But narrowing their field to the Latino market gets old for some
companies when they realize they can move into the broader U.S.
market. Take Grupo Industrial Bimbo, Mexico's leading breadmaker.
It targets Mexican customers in Texas with an ad campaign based on
its old logo and the tag line, ``Remember me?'' But last year, it
also bought Dallas-based Mrs. Baird's Bread, the leading breadmaker
in northern Texas. That kind of acquisition has helped Bimbo _ in
Spanish, just a name, not a word for a buxom airhead _ to become an
important supplier of bread and wheat flour in the Southwest.
 &HT;    It's not alone in making such a move in the food industry.
Gruma, the largest corn flour miller in Mexico, has long
specialized in the business of making tortillas on both sides of
the border. But now the company actually sells more corn flour and
tortillas through its Texas-based Mission Foods and other U.S.
subsidiaries than it does at home. And non-Latino customers are
providing the growth in Gruma's U.S. sales.
 &HT;    The same goes for Agro Bios, a food products division of Mexico
City-based conglomerate Grupo Desc. Last year, the company bought
California-based Authentic Specialty Foods, a leading purveyor of
Mexican food that has helped make salsa more popular than ketchup
north of the border.
 &HT;    An added benefit to the acquisition is that now Corfuerte,
another Desc-owned food company, can export its Mexican sauces
through Authentic Specialty Foods. That has changed the orientation
of Corfuerte, which now sells more of its salsa verde, salsa roja,
salsa borracha and other sauces on the northern side of the border
than south of it. After all, Mexicans tend to make their salsas at
home. People in the U.S. are more likely to buy bottled salsa of
the sort Corfuerte makes in Tlaxcala and Sinaloa.
 &HT;    ``It's ironic, but the U.S. market could eventually be better
for us, since people there prefer to buy bottled salsa,'' says
German Vazquez, the director of marketing at Corfuerte in Mexico
City. ``The taste for real Mexican food is catching on in the U.S.
And we've seen how the U.S. market has become a key part of our
business.''
 &HT;    Many of the most successful companies in Mexico are coming to
similar conclusions.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO CITY _ If you live in the United States, look closely at
the gas range in your kitchen. While the brand may be as American
as General Electric or Kenmore, odds are one in three that the
stove was made in Mexico. And there's a one-in-five chance that the
mini-refrigerator in the corner is also made south of the border.
Rafael Nava, spokesperson for Mabe, the Mexican manufacturer that
produces both appliances, says rather modestly, ``North America is
like one market for us.''
 &HT;    While all eyes are on the McDonaldization of Mexico, the country
is quietly emerging as an industrial power that manufactures many
of the goods that compose the fabric of American life. The trend
started in the mid-1980s with mere assembly lines along the
2,000-mile border, but the unprecedented union between a developing
and developed economy is now moving into new territory much farther
south. Multinational companies operating in Mexico as well as local
conglomerates are turning the country's US$ 420 billion economy
into a vital part of the vastly larger $7.2 trillion U.S. market.
 &HT;    ``What we're seeing is the advanced stages of industrial
integration between the U.S. and Mexico,'' says Raul Hinojosa,
director of the North American Integration and Development Center
at the University of California at Los Angeles. What is most
evident is that Mexico is being swallowed whole. More than a third
of the country's entire economy consists of trade with its northern
neighbor, and talk abounds of one day even adopting the dollar as
official currency.
 &HT;    Not so obvious is that Mexico is now the number two U.S. trade
partner after Canada, and total bilateral trade has tripled since
the start of the decade to almost $196 billion in 1998. It trades
more manufactured goods with the United States than Japan and more
textiles with the United States than China. Mexico supplies the
United States with its Chrysler minivans, IBM Thinkpads and
Whirlpool refrigerators.
 &HT;    ``What industrial integration means on the ground is that any
closure of the production chain in one country is likely to disrupt
production in the other country,'' says Hinojosa. ``We saw that
with the General Motors strike last year in the U.S. that stopped
work in plants across Mexico.''
 &HT;    When autoworkers walked off the job in Flint, Michigan in the
middle of last year, General Motors plants crawled to a halt in
Mexican cities such as Silao, Saltillo and Ciudad Juarez. The
eight-week strike idled almost all of GM's nearly 84,000 Mexican
workers. More remarkable still, the work stoppage would barely have
affected its operations south of the border as recently as 1986.
 &HT;    At that time, GM employed only 24,000 Mexican workers, and the
world's largest automaker had just transferred its entire
wire-harness operation to Ciudad Juarez, marking a new stage in the
two-decade-old program for in-bond assembly plants, better known as
maquiladoras. Automakers and autoparts quickly transformed the
eastern border between Mexico and the United States into a massive
assembly center, while on the western frontier electronics firms
like Japan's Matsushita (formerly Panasonic) turned the TijuanaSan
Diego area into what is today the world's largest center for
television set production.
 &HT;    The maquila program continues to play a large role in total
bilateral trade, but the plants are no longer limited to the border
nor are they simply assembling parts. Today, managers in Detroit
and other automotive capitals now entrust Mexican plants with
manufacturing vehicles not just for Mexicans, but for customers in
the United States, Canada and beyond. Mexican-made vehicles are
crucial to car companies' global fortunes.
 &HT;    To wit: Ford makes its Escorts for North America in Hermosillo.
General Motors produces its Silverado model in Guanajuato. Chrysler
plants in Mexico churn out Ram Chargers and also minivans _ the
same minivans that are leading sales growth in the United States.
 &HT;    Then there's Volkswagen and its hot-selling New Beetle, which is
reviving the German company's U.S. sales. The site VW managers
chose for such a key product? Puebla. The plant there also cranks
out the latest Jetta, another popular model north of the border.
 &HT;    The automakers are attracting both foreign and Mexican
suppliers. Mexicto produce more than $13 billion in autoparts this
year, up 10 percent from last year _ and twice what it produced
just four years ago. And the automakers are not alone.
 &HT;    Patrick Martin, president of developing market operations
worldwide for Xerox, explains that multinationals and local
companies across the board are finding that Mexico is a very
competitive manufacturing site. ``When Mexico took down its trade
barriers in 1987, our Aguascalientes plant could not compete,''
says Martin, indicating that the firm's copier plant, like many
others, was set up to gain access to the protected Mexican market.
``Today, the plant is one of our largest and most productive in the
world.'' To get there, Xerox poured in $300 million.
 &HT;    Similarly, IBM now makes all its Thinkpads for North America in
Guadalajara, where Hewlett-Packard and Motorola aso have
manufacturing facilities.
 &HT;    Many Mexican firms like appliance-maker Mabe export, albeit
anonymously, to the United States too. In this way, the country has
become the largest exporter of textiles also to its northern
neighbor, displacing China.
 &HT;    Yet nobody recognizes brand names like those belonging to
Chihuahua-based Grupo Industrial Parras, a major denim
manufacturer, or perhaps even sees the discreet ``Made in Mexico''
label on women's underwear and synthetic fabrics.
 &HT;    Emboldened, many Mexican firms are venturing across the border
to establish distribution and their own brand names. Take Imsa, the
Monterrey-based steel company. When Eugenio Clariond Reyes became
chairman in the 1980s, the company barely exported anything. Last
year it shipped $865 million abroad on sales of $2 billion. Its
secret lies in dominating U.S. market niches.
 &HT;    Imsa is the second-largest manufacturer of steel staircases in
the world, and the largest foreign supplier to the United States.
It exported $1 million in staircases in 1993. It exported $190
million last year, much of it to the north. That's not all _ with
staircase plants in Texas and Arkansas, Middle America shares the
company's production with northern Mexico. Imsa is also a major
producer of steel panels, which it churns out from plants in
Monterrey and Tijuana, as well as in Texas and Virginia.
 &HT;    ``We had three employees in a Houston sales office in the early
1990s,'' said Clariond Reyes in a recent speech. ``Now we have 610
throughout the United States. Nafta is not a cure-all for Mexico,
but it is generating a new kind of relationship with the U.S.''
 &HT;    Similar stories abound. Big companies in both manufacturing and
services are looking to invest in the North. Dina, the bus and
truckmaker, even partially moved its headquarters to the United
States. After all, Dina's sales in Mexico fell by more than half
during the economic crisis of 1995, and it is now in the midst of
an emergency financial restructuring. But up north, where it owns
Motor Coach Industries, the leading manufacturer of long-distance
buses, Dina is thriving.
 &HT;    Typically, Mexican companies first view the U.S. market through
the lens of Latino customers. Gigante, the supermarket chain,
recently opened a store in East Los Angeles, where it aims to
exploit its familiarity with Mexican consumers.
 &HT;    Another big bet on the Latino market comes from Telefonos de
Mexico (Telmex). Telmex ditched former partner Sprint last May in
its bid to attract Hispanics to its long-distance service north of
the border. Now it plans to roll out its service with a new
partner, San Antonio-based SBC, although SBC _ formerly
Southwestern Bell _ is a Baby Bell with far less long-distance
experience than Sprint. Or, for that matter, Telmex.
 &HT;    But narrowing their field to the Latino market gets old for some
companies when they realize they can move into the broader U.S.
market. Take Grupo Industrial Bimbo, Mexico's leading breadmaker.
It targets Mexican customers in Texas with an ad campaign based on
its old logo and the tag line, ``Remember me?'' But last year, it
also bought Dallas-based Mrs. Baird's Bread, the leading breadmaker
in northern Texas. That kind of acquisition has helped Bimbo _ in
Spanish, just a name, not a word for a buxom airhead _ to become an
important supplier of bread and wheat flour in the Southwest.
 &HT;    It's not alone in making such a move in the food industry.
Gruma, the largest corn flour miller in Mexico, has long
specialized in the business of making tortillas on both sides of
the border. But now the company actually sells more corn flour and
tortillas through its Texas-based Mission Foods and other U.S.
subsidiaries than it does at home. And non-Latino customers are
providing the growth in Gruma's U.S. sales.
 &HT;    The same goes for Agro Bios, a food products division of Mexico
City-based conglomerate Grupo Desc. Last year, the company bought
California-based Authentic Specialty Foods, a leading purveyor of
Mexican food that has helped make salsa more popular than ketchup
north of the border.
 &HT;    An added benefit to the acquisition is that now Corfuerte,
another Desc-owned food company, can export its Mexican sauces
through Authentic Specialty Foods. That has changed the orientation
of Corfuerte, which now sells more of its salsa verde, salsa roja,
salsa borracha and other sauces on the northern side of the border
than south of it. After all, Mexicans tend to make their salsas at
home. People in the U.S. are more likely to buy bottled salsa of
the sort Corfuerte makes in Tlaxcala and Sinaloa.
 &HT;    ``It's ironic, but the U.S. market could eventually be better
for us, since people there prefer to buy bottled salsa,'' says
German Vazquez, the director of marketing at Corfuerte in Mexico
City. ``The taste for real Mexican food is catching on in the U.S.
And we've seen how the U.S. market has become a key part of our
business.''
 &HT;    Many of the most successful companies in Mexico are coming to
similar conclusions.

 This ``separate buy'' article is from Latin Trade magazine,
America's leading journal of Latin American business, finance and
trade: &HT;    THE UNITED STATE OF MEXICO. South of the border, companies are
turning the country's $420 billion economy into a major cog in the
$7.2 trillion U.S. market. And as Mexico annexes sectors of the
U.S. economy _ electronics, computers, appliances, cars, to name
just a few _ many things Mexican are entering, and in some cases,
dominating mainstream America in entertainment, food and culture.

   Some say the whole Kennedy family is ``reckless.'' Others argue
that they are admirably bold and that it's unseemly to criticize
them. Each camp oversimplifies the truth. There are two Kennedy

recklessness, frivolity and mayhem on the other.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    CIUDAD DE MEXICO _ Si usted vive en estados unidos, fijese en su
cocina de gas. Aunque la marca sea General Electric o Kenmore, es
muy probable sea fabricada en Mexico. Lo mismo sucede con el
refrigerador. Rafael Nava, portavoz de Mabe, fabricante mexicano de
electrodomesticos, dice con modestia: ``Norteamerica es como un
solo mercado para nosotros.''
 &HT;    Paralelamente a la macdonaldizacion de Mexico, ese pais se
convierte poco a poco en una potencia industrial que fabrica gran
parte de los poductos mas comunes en Estados Unidos. Esto comenzo a
mediados de los anos 80, con el establecimiento de lineas de
ensamblaje en la frontera entre ambos paises, pero la union sin
precedentes entre una economia en desarrollo y una desarrollada ya
se concreta mucho mas al sur. Las multinacionales que operan en
Mexico, asi como conglomerados nacionales, convierten esa economia
de US$420.000 millones en parte vital del mercado estadounidense,
que mueve US$7,2 billones.
 &HT;    ``Lo que vemos son las etapas avanzadas de la integracion
industrial entre Estados Unidos y Mexico,'' dice Raul Hinojosa,
director del Centro de Desarrollo e Integracion Norteamericana en
la Universidad de California en Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Mas de la tercera parte de la economia mexicana es el comercio
con Estados Unidos, y crecen los rumores de que quiza un dia adopte
oficialmente el dolar.
 &HT;    No es tan obvio que Mexico es el segundo socio comercial de
Estados Unidos, despues de Canada, y que el comercio bilateral se
ha triplicado desde 1990, para llegar a US$196.000 millones en
1998. Mexico comercia mas productos manufacturados con EU que Japon
y mas productos textiles que China. Mexico suministra a Estados
Unidos las furgonetas Chrysler, las Thinkpad de IBM y los
refrigeradores Whirlpool.
 &HT;    ``Lo que la integracion industrial significa en realidad es que
cualquier interrupcion de la cadena de produccion en un pais
probablemente interrumpa la produccion en el otro,'' comenta
Hinojosa. ``Eso paso con la huelga de General Motors en Estados
Unidos el ano pasado, que paralizo fabricas de Mexico.''
 &HT;    Cuando los obreros suspendieron el trabajo en Flint, Michigan, a
mediados de 1998, se detuvieron las plantas de General Motors en
Silao, Saltillo y Ciudad Juarez. La huelga de ocho semanas dejo
ociosos a los casi 84.000 trabajadores mexicanos de GM. Lo mas
notable es que la huelga apenas habria afectado esas operaciones en
una fecha tan reciente como 1986.
 &HT;    En aquel momento, GM solo tenia 24.000 trabajadores mexicanos y
acababa de transferir toda su operacion de cableado a Ciudad
Juarez, con lo que iniciaba una nueva etapa en el programa de
maquiladoras, iniciado hace dos decadas. Los fabricantes de autos y
piezas transformaron rapidamente la parte oriental de la frontera
entre Mexico y Estados Unidos en un enorme centro de ensamblaje,
mientras en la parte occidental, firmas como la japonesa Matsushita
(antes Panasonic), convertian a la zona de Tijuana-San Diego en el
mayor centro de produccion de televisores del mundo.
 &HT;    El programa de la maquila es todavia muy importante en el
comercio bilateral, pero las plantas ya no se limitan a la frontera
ni se dedican simplemente a ensamblar. Hoy, los gerentes en Detroit
y otras capitales del automovil confian a las plantas mexicanas la
produccion de vehiculos no solo para mexicanos, sino para clientes
en Estados Unidos, Canada y otros paises. Los vehiculos fabricados
en Mexico tienen un papel vital para las companias automotrices.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo: Ford fabrica su modelo Escort para Norteamerica en
Hermosillo. General Motors produce el modelo Silverado en
Guanajuato. Las plantas de Chrysler en Mexico producen los Ram
Chargers y tambien furgonetas, las mismas que impulsan el aumento
de las ventas en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Tambien esta Volkswagen y su popular nuevo Escarabajo, que
revive las ventas de la empresa alemana en Estados Unidos. El lugar
que la gerencia de VW escogio para fabricar ese producto clave fue
Puebla, donde tambien se produce el mas reciente Jetta, otro modelo
popular en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Los fabricantes de autos atraen a suministradores extranjeros y
mexicanos. Mexico espera producir mas de US$13.000 millones en
piezas de autos este ano, 10 por ciento mas que el ano pasado y dos
veces la cifra de hace solo cuatro anos. Y hay mas.
 &HT;    Patrick Martin, presidente de operaciones de mercados
internacionales en desarrollo de Xerox, explica que las
multinacionales y las companias locales descubren que Mexico es un
lugar muy competitivo para la manufactura. ``Cuando Mexico elimino
sus barreras comerciales en 1987, nuestra planta de Aguascalientes
no podia competir,'' dice Martin. Y agrega que la fabrica de
copiadoras de la firma, como muchas otras, se monto para ganar
acceso al protegido mercado mexicano. ``Hoy, la planta es una de
nuestras fabricas mayores y mas productivas en todo el mundo.''
Para alcanzar esa posicion, Xerox le inyecto US$300 millones.
 &HT;    Del mismo modo, IBM fabrica todos sus Thinkpad para Norteamerica
en Guadalajara, donde Hewlett-Packard y Motorola tambien tienen
fabricas.
 &HT;    Muchas empresas mexicanas, como Mabe, fabricante de
electrodomesticos, tambien exportan a Estados Unidos, aunque
anonimamente. De esta manera, Mexico se ha convertido en el mayor
exportador de productos textiles a su vecino del norte, desplazando
de ese puesto a China.
 &HT;    Pero nadie reconoce marcas como las de Grupo Industrial Parras,
con sede en Chihuahua, fabricante de tela para jeans, y ni quiza
siquiera ve la discreta etiqueta ``Hecho en Mexico'' colocada en
ropa interior de mujer y tejidos sinteticos.
 &HT;    Alentadas, muchas empresas mexicanas se aventuran a entrar a
Estados Unidos para crear operaciones de distribucion y establecer
su marca. Un ejemplo es Imsa, empresa acerera de Monterrey. Cuando
Eugenio Clariond Reyes ocupo el puesto de presidente del directorio
en los anos 80, la empresa apenas exportaba. El ano pasado exporto
productos por valor de US$865 millones, con ventas de US$2.000
millones. Su secreto es dominar nichos del mercado estadounidense.
 &HT;    Imsa es el segundo fabricante de escaleras de acero del mundo, y
el mayor suministrador extranjero de Estados Unidos. En 1993
exporto US$1 millon en escaleras. El ano pasado exporto US$190
millones, una buena parte rumbo norte. Y eso no es todo: la
produccion de escaleras se realiza en el norte de Mexico, pero
tambien en Texas y Arkansas. Imsa es ademas un importante productor
de paneles de acero, que fabrica en plantas en Monterrey y Tijuana,
asi como en Texas y Virginia.
 &HT;    ``A principios de los anos 90 teniamos tres empleados en una
oficina de ventas de Houston,'' dijo Clariond Reyes en un discurso
reciente. ``Ahora tenemos 610 en todo Estados Unidos. El TLC no es
la panacea de Mexico, pero esta creando una nueva clase de relacion
con Estados Unidos.''
 &HT;    Abundan anecdotas similares. Grandes companias de manufactura y
de servicios buscan inversiones en el norte. Dina, fabricante de
autobuses y camiones, movio algunas de sus oficinas a Estados
Unidos. Despues de todo, las ventas de Dina en Mexico bajaron mas
de la mitad durante la crisis economica de 1995, y ahora esta en
medio de una reestructuracion financiera de emergencia. Pero al
norte, donde es propietaria de Motor Coach Industries, Dina
prospera.
 &HT;    Generalmente, las companias mexicanas ven primero el mercado
estadounidense a traves del prisma del cliente latino. La cadena de
supermercados Gigante abrio recientemente un establecimiento en el
este de Los Angeles, donde espera aprovechar su conocimiento de los
consumidores mexicanos.
 &HT;    Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) tambien ha hecho una gran apuesta
en el mercado hispano. En mayo, Telmex abandono a su socio Sprint
en su intento de atraer a los hispanos a su servicio de larga
distancia al norte de la frontera. Ahora planea lanzar su servicio
con un nuevo socio, SBC, de San Antonio, aunque SBC (antes
Southwestern Bell) tiene menos experiencia en telefonia de larga
distancia que Sprint o que el propio Telmex.
 &HT;    Pero limitarse al mercado hispano es una postura obsoleta para
las companias que comprenden que pueden moverse al mas vasto
mercado estadounidense. Por ejemplo, el Grupo Industrial Bimbo, el
mayor fabricante de pan de Mexico, apunta a los clientes mexicanos
de Texas en una campana publicitaria basada en su viejo logo y en
la frase ``Remember me? (Se acuerdan de mi?)'' Pero el ano pasado,
tambien compro Mrs. Baird's Bread, de Dallas, la principal
productora de pan en el norte de Texas. Esa clase de adquisicion ha
ayudado a Bimbo a convertirse en un importante suministrador de pan
y harina de trigo en el Suroeste.
 &HT;    Bimbo no es el unico que da un paso semejante en la industria
alimentaria. Gruma, el mayor productor de harina de maiz de Mexico,
se especializa desde hace tiempo en el negocio de las tortillas
mexicanas a ambos lados de la frontera. Pero ahora la compania
vende mas tortillas y harina de maiz a traves de su filial Mission
Foods, en Texas, y otras filiales en Estados Unidos que en Mexico.
Y los clientes que no son latinos son los que impulsan el aumento
de las ventas de Gruma en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Lo mismo sucede con Agro Bios, division de productos
alimenticios del Grupo Desc, un conglomerado de la Ciudad de
Mexico. El ano pasado, la compania compro Authentic Specialty
Foods, con sede en California, un importante abastecedor de comidas
mexicanas que ha contribuido a que la salsa picante sea mas popular
que el ketchup al norte de la frontera.
 &HT;    Una ventaja adicional de la adquisicion es que ahora Corfuerte,
otra compania alimentaria propiedad de Desc, puede exportar sus
salsas mexicanas a traves de Authentic Specialty Foods, lo cual ha
cambiado la orientacion de Corfuerte, que ahora vende mas salsas
verdes, rojas, borrachas y otras en Estados Unidos que en Mexico.
 &HT;    A fin de cuentas, los mexicanos suelen hacer sus salsas en la
casa, mientras los estadounidenses prefieren comprar la salsa
embotellada del tipo que Corfuerte elabora en Tlaxcala y Sinaloa.
``Es ironico, pero el mercado estadounidense con el tiempo podria
ser mejor para nosotros, ya que la gente prefiere comprar la salsa
embotellada,'' dice German Vazquez, director de mercadeo de
Corfuerte en la Ciudad de Mexico.
 &HT;    ``En Estados Unidos se impone el gusto por la comida mexicana. Y
hemos visto como el mercado estadounidense se ha convertido en
parte clave de nuestro negocio.''
 &HT;    Muchas companias de Mexico han llegado a una conclusion similar.

internacionales en desarrollo de Xerox, explica que las
multinacionales y las companias locales descubren que Mexico es un
lugar muy competitivo para la manufactura. ``Cuando Mexico elimino
sus barreras comerciales en 1987, nuestra planta de Aguascalientes
no podia competir,'' dice Martin. Y agrega que la fabrica de
copiadoras de la firma, como muchas otras, se monto para ganar
acceso al protegido mercado mexicano. ``Hoy, la planta es una de
nuestras fabricas mayores y mas productivas en todo el mundo.''
Para alcanzar esa posicion, Xerox le inyecto US$300 millones.
 &HT;    Del mismo modo, IBM fabrica todos sus Thinkpad para Norteamerica
en Guadalajara, donde Hewlett-Packard y Motorola tambien tienen
fabricas.
 &HT;    Muchas empresas mexicanas, como Mabe, fabricante de
electrodomesticos, tambien exportan a Estados Unidos, aunque
anonimamente. De esta manera, Mexico se ha convertido en el mayor
exportador de productos textiles a su vecino del norte, desplazando
de ese puesto a China.
 &HT;    Pero nadie reconoce marcas como las de Grupo Industrial Parras,
con sede en Chihuahua, fabricante de tela para jeans, y ni quiza
siquiera ve la discreta etiqueta ``Hecho en Mexico'' colocada en
ropa interior de mujer y tejidos sinteticos.
 &HT;    Alentadas, muchas empresas mexicanas se aventuran a entrar a
Estados Unidos para crear operaciones de distribucion y establecer
su marca. Un ejemplo es Imsa, empresa acerera de Monterrey. Cuando
Eugenio Clariond Reyes ocupo el puesto de presidente del directorio
en los anos 80, la empresa apenas exportaba. El ano pasado exporto
productos por valor de US$865 millones, con ventas de US$2.000
millones. Su secreto es dominar nichos del mercado estadounidense.
 &HT;    Imsa es el segundo fabricante de escaleras de acero del mundo, y
el mayor suministrador extranjero de Estados Unidos. En 1993
exporto US$1 millon en escaleras. El ano pasado exporto US$190
millones, una buena parte rumbo norte. Y eso no es todo: la
produccion de escaleras se realiza en el norte de Mexico, pero
tambien en Texas y Arkansas. Imsa es ademas un importante productor
de paneles de acero, que fabrica en plantas en Monterrey y Tijuana,
asi como en Texas y Virginia.
 &HT;    ``A principios de los anos 90 teniamos tres empleados en una
oficina de ventas de Houston,'' dijo Clariond Reyes en un discurso
reciente. ``Ahora tenemos 610 en todo Estados Unidos. El TLC no es
la panacea de Mexico, pero esta creando una nueva clase de relacion
con Estados Unidos.''
 &HT;    Abundan anecdotas similares. Grandes companias de manufactura y
de servicios buscan inversiones en el norte. Dina, fabricante de
autobuses y camiones, movio algunas de sus oficinas a Estados
Unidos. Despues de todo, las ventas de Dina en Mexico bajaron mas
de la mitad durante la crisis economica de 1995, y ahora esta en
medio de una reestructuracion financiera de emergencia. Pero al
norte, donde es propietaria de Motor Coach Industries, Dina
prospera.
 &HT;    Generalmente, las companias mexicanas ven primero el mercado
estadounidense a traves del prisma del cliente latino. La cadena de
supermercados Gigante abrio recientemente un establecimiento en el
este de Los Angeles, donde espera aprovechar su conocimiento de los
consumidores mexicanos.
 &HT;    Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) tambien ha hecho una gran apuesta
en el mercado hispano. En mayo, Telmex abandono a su socio Sprint
en su intento de atraer a los hispanos a su servicio de larga
distancia al norte de la frontera. Ahora planea lanzar su servicio
con un nuevo socio, SBC, de San Antonio, aunque SBC (antes
Southwestern Bell) tiene menos experiencia en telefonia de larga
distancia que Sprint o que el propio Telmex.
 &HT;    Pero limitarse al mercado hispano es una postura obsoleta para
las companias que comprenden que pueden moverse al mas vasto
mercado estadounidense. Por ejemplo, el Grupo Industrial Bimbo, el
mayor fabricante de pan de Mexico, apunta a los clientes mexicanos
de Texas en una campana publicitaria basada en su viejo logo y en
la frase ``Remember me? (Se acuerdan de mi?)'' Pero el ano pasado,
tambien compro Mrs. Baird's Bread, de Dallas, la principal
productora de pan en el norte de Texas. Esa clase de adquisicion ha
ayudado a Bimbo a convertirse en un importante suministrador de pan
y harina de trigo en el Suroeste.
 &HT;    Bimbo no es el unico que da un paso semejante en la industria
alimentaria. Gruma, el mayor productor de harina de maiz de Mexico,
se especializa desde hace tiempo en el negocio de las tortillas
mexicanas a ambos lados de la frontera. Pero ahora la compania
vende mas tortillas y harina de maiz a traves de su filial Mission
Foods, en Texas, y otras filiales en Estados Unidos que en Mexico.
Y los clientes que no son latinos son los que impulsan el aumento
de las ventas de Gruma en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Lo mismo sucede con Agro Bios, division de productos
alimenticios del Grupo Desc, un conglomerado de la Ciudad de
Mexico. El ano pasado, la compania compro Authentic Specialty
Foods, con sede en California, un importante abastecedor de comidas
mexicanas que ha contribuido a que la salsa picante sea mas popular
que el ketchup al norte de la frontera.
 &HT;    Una ventaja adicional de la adquisicion es que ahora Corfuerte,
otra compania alimentaria propiedad de Desc, puede exportar sus
salsas mexicanas a traves de Authentic Specialty Foods, lo cual ha
cambiado la orientacion de Corfuerte, que ahora vende mas salsas
verdes, rojas, borrachas y otras en Estados Unidos que en Mexico.
 &HT;    A fin de cuentas, los mexicanos suelen hacer sus salsas en la
casa, mientras los estadounidenses prefieren comprar la salsa
embotellada del tipo que Corfuerte elabora en Tlaxcala y Sinaloa.
``Es ironico, pero el mercado estadounidense con el tiempo podria
ser mejor para nosotros, ya que la gente prefiere comprar la salsa
embotellada,'' dice German Vazquez, director de mercadeo de
Corfuerte en la Ciudad de Mexico.
 &HT;    ``En Estados Unidos se impone el gusto por la comida mexicana. Y
hemos visto como el mercado estadounidense se ha convertido en
parte clave de nuestro negocio.''
 &HT;    Muchas companias de Mexico han llegado a una conclusion similar.

   1. MISJUDGMENT, DECADENCE AND THE KENNEDY `CURSE', by William
Saletan
</P>
<P>
   Some say the whole Kennedy family is ``reckless.'' Others argue
that they are admirably bold and that it's unseemly to criticize
them. Each camp oversimplifies the truth. There are two Kennedy
traditions: courage, gravity and martyrdom on one side;
recklessness, frivolity and mayhem on the other.

   2. PRESIDENTS' SONS WHO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, by David Greenberg
</P>
<P>
   It would be impossible for anyone in George W. Bush's shoes not
to bear an especially heavy Oedipal burden. The life of the only
son of a president to become president--John Quincy
Adams--illustrates why.

JFK JR. HAD TWO WHITE HOUSE VISITS BEFORE ONE WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton was mistaken when he said John F.
Kennedy Jr. had not visited the White House after the assassination
of President Kennedy until Clinton invited him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a news conference Wednesday, said he had helped the
younger Kennedy ``come to terms'' with the death of his father by
taking him on a tour of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Kennedy had actually not been back to the White House
since his father was killed until I became president,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the young Kennedy had visited the White House earlier,
during the terms of both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and his mother had a private dinner at the White House
at the invitation of Pat Nixon on Feb. 3, 1971. The next day,
Kennedy, who was then 10 years old, wrote a three-page thank-you
note to the Nixons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never thank you more for showing us the White House,''
Kennedy wrote, in a letter posted Thursday on the Web site of the
Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace Foundation
(http://www.nixonfoundation.org). ``I really liked everything about
it. You were so nice to show us everything. I don't think I could
remember much about the White House but it was really nice seeing
it all again.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy continued: ``When I sat on Lincoln's bed and wished for
something, my wish really came true. I wished that I would have
good luck at school.'' Kennedy also said he ``loved the dogs,''
``really liked the old pistols,'' and the food ``was the best I
have ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, also wrote to the
Nixons, saying, ``A day I have always dreaded turned out to be one
of the most precious I have spent with my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also visited the White House in 1981 when Reagan had a
ceremony honoring Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   White House Deputy Press Secretary Jake Siewert said Thursday
that Clinton made his comment based on what Kennedy had told him
during his March 5, 1998, visit to the White House. ``The president
was recounting a private conversation he and Mrs. Clinton had with
John,'' Siewert said.

TEST SCORES SHOW DIVIDE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Results of the statewide achievement test show a
huge divide between California students who are fluent in English
and those with limited English schools. And the gap is similar
between students from better-off families and this with low
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Scores released Thursday for 4.3 million children in schools
across the state are as varied as the students themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At Woodside Elementary in San Mateo County, at least 80 percent
of students scored at or above the national average in every grade
and subject. A few miles away in the same county, fewer than 35
percent of Ravenswood Elementary School students met or surpassed
the national average in any grade or subject.
</P>
<P>
   Similar differences exist _ typically but glaringly between
schools in low-income areas and those in wealthier neighborhoods _
in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa and Marin counties.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oakland Unified School District, for example, scores for
every grade and subject hovered around 30, meaning 30 percent of
district students met or surpassed the national average. In
neighboring Piedmont City Unified, roughly 90 percent of students
in every grade and subject scored at or above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the results _ delayed for three weeks due to a
publisher's error _ were upbeat in nearly every grade and subject
for students who are fluent in English. However, for the 1 million
students who lack English skills and the 1.5 million children who
come from low-income families, they scores were persistently low.
</P>
<P>
   In reading, 56 percent of second-graders who are fluent in
English scored at or above the national average, compared with 19
percent of the students who have limited English skills. By the
fifth grade, only 9 percent of those with limited English skills
were at or above the national average in reading.
</P>
<P>
   In math, 52 percent of all English-fluent eighth-graders met or
surpassed the national average, compared with 15 percent of kids
who speak limited English.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has such a diverse population,'' said state schools
chief Delaine Eastin. ``Students who are fluent in English are
posting solid results. Not surprisingly, scores of English learners
demonstrate that it is difficult for these students to do well in
academic areas until they are proficient in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Students in grades 2 through 11 took the multiple choice
Stanford 9 test. The STAR test, as it is also known, has a top
score of 99. A score of 50 is the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Scores for the state's low-income students _ those who qualify
for free or reduced-price lunches _ were on average half as high as
scores of the 2.7 million test-takers who are not classified as
economically disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   In reading, 22 percent of low-income fourth-graders scored at or
above the national average, compared with 56 percent of
fourth-graders who are not economically disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   In math, 33 percent of low-income sixth-graders met or surpassed
the national average, compared with 56 percent of more affluent
sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As measured by these tests, you see a two-tiered system of
education in California,'' said Kenji Hakuta, a professor of
education at Stanford University. ``High-poverty schools and
schools with high percentages of limited-English students face a
real challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most notable areas of improvement on the test is the
consistently strong performance of second-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across districts, regardless of whether the students are
English-only or bilingual, there are increases from last year to
this in second grade,'' Hakuta said.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the solid scores among second-graders to several
factors, including increased public attention on improving the
early primary grades, and the state's $3.7 billion effort begun in
1996 to reduce class size to 20 pupils per teacher in kindergarten
through the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the state's class-size reduction program was
released in June by a consortium of independent research
organizations. The study found that students in smaller classes
scored an average of 2 to 3 percentage points higher on exams than
those in larger classes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 and 1999 scores also revealed a disturbing trend: High
school students had the hardest time with the most basic and
critical skills, the test results showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're an 11th-grader in California, you've spent 12 years
in school at a time when we were disinvesting in education,''
Eastin said. ``The scores confirm a need to turn our attention to
high school, where kids don't have the benefit of class-size
reduction.''

<P>
   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the scent of blood in the water, the media swarmed the
crash site of John F. Kennedy Jr. While pedestrian reporters
investigated the disaster, pundits debated the more entertaining
question: Why does this keep happening to the Kennedys?
</P>
<P>
   Some say the whole family is ``reckless.'' Others argue that the
Kennedys are admirably bold and that it's unseemly to criticize
them.
</P>
<P>
   Each camp oversimplifies the truth. There are two Kennedy
traditions: courage, gravity and martyrdom on one side;
recklessness, frivolity and mayhem on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The ``recklessness'' spin, fueled by talk radio and the
Internet, says the Kennedys seek ``adventure,'' ``live close to the
edge,'' are ``wild'' and ``addicted to risk,'' and have a
``dangerous streak.''
</P>
<P>
   This spin laughably equates all dangerous behavior. ``Taking
physical risks is a Kennedy family tradition,'' says Newsweek.
``During World War II, the oldest son, Joe Jr., ... died on a
virtual suicide mission. ... Jack Kennedy chose PT boats, rickety
crafts whose crews boasted that 'they were expendable.' Bobby
Kennedy's children always seemed to be falling out of trees.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove that young John Kennedy was reckless, these spinners
paste together weak bits of evidence. As a boy, he used to evade
his Secret Service agents. He once took a survival course. Another
time, he went to Africa and was charged by a rhinoceros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learned through all these experiences to make light of
danger,'' asserts Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he enjoyed rock climbing, paragliding, scuba diving,
kayaking and Rollerblading. He asked permission to rappel down
Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   He launched a magazine--demonstrating, according to Reuters,
that ``like other members of his legendary family, Kennedy had a
taste for danger and took risks.'' He invited Larry Flynt to a
black-tie dinner. He even lived ``in an edgy warehouse district.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``courage'' spin puts an equally simplistic gloss of
nobility on the family's escapades. As questions about recklessness
bounced around the Sunday talk shows, Kennedy pal Douglas Brinkley
argued that ``John Jr. and the Kennedy family [are] 'in the arena,'
and they're living a vigorous life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bold,'' agreed Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn. ``They have
always had courage. They've always wanted to live to the fullest.''
Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen admonished critics, ``It is
an active family, an achieving family, and so its members have
taken some chances.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times boasted that ``the Kennedys have always been
risk-takers, in play, politics and war. At its best, there is a
certain nobility to the Kennedys' refusal to let life intimidate
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all the family's risk-taking has been ``bold'' or
``wild.'' Some Kennedys have been far more reckless than others.
Was John Kennedy's death reckless? Let's consider the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   1. Who caused the tragedy? Most of the coverage depicts John as
the victim of a family ``curse.'' The Kennedys are ``stalked by
tragedy,'' suffering ``bad luck'' or a ``near-biblical blight''
that has been inflicted, according to Mario Cuomo, by ``gods.'' Not
only were Jack and Bobby assassinated, but ``the younger generation
of Kennedys has been haunted by bad news as well,'' says the
Post--''as if fate were picking them off,'' laments Time.
</P>
<P>
   This passive language obscures an important distinction. Whereas
Jack and Bobby were murdered, the ``younger generation,'' far from
being ``haunted'' or ``picked off,'' caused its own grief. Joe
overturned a jeep, leaving his brother's girlfriend paralyzed.
Bobby Jr. introduced mescaline to his 13-year-old brother David,
who eventually died of a drug overdose. Michael slept with his
kids' teen-age baby sitter and later skied into a tree. William
Kennedy Smith, their cousin, went out on the town with Uncle Teddy,
brought home a woman, and ended up being tried unsuccessfully for
rape.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these traditions does John Kennedy belong to? The Times
argued that like Jack and Bobby, John was ``cut down far too
early.'' Again, passive language distorts the facts. John was at
the controls when his vehicle crashed--just like Cousin Joe and
Uncle Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   2. Who's the victim? On ``Meet the Press,'' Tim Russert played
the 30-year-old video clip in which Ted Kennedy tried to explain to
the nation why, having driven his car off a bridge after a party on
Chappaquiddick Island--and having swum to safety while his young
campaign aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, drowned in the car--he had failed
to report the accident to police. In the clip, Kennedy raised the
question ``whether some awful curse did actually hang over all the
Kennedys, whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubt
what had happened and to delay my report.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert offered the clip as an omen of the ``curse'' that would
strike John Kennedy 30 years later. Russert's guest, columnist Mike
Barnicle, heaped praise and sympathy on Ted Kennedy for having
``borne so many'' family tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody pointed out that at Chappaquiddick, unlike Dallas and Los
Angeles, the person most responsible for the tragedy was a Kennedy,
whereas the victim was not--and that Ted Kennedy's invocation of
the family ``curse'' was a clever way of papering over these
differences. Thanks to this blurring of the victim-perpetrator
distinction, Ted's nephew Joe was able to get elected to Congress
despite his own car accident, which likewise devastated his
passenger, four years after Chappaquiddick.
</P>
<P>
   Which tradition does John Kennedy belong to? Most pundits,
recalling Jack's and Bobby's assassinations, have cast his family
as the ultimate victim of his crash. ``Stop blaming John. It is
enough that tragedy once again punished the Kennedys,'' wrote
Cohen. But attention is gradually shifting to the Bessette family,
whose daughters were passengers on John's plane. The Chappaquiddick
analogies can't be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   3. For what purpose was the risk taken? To illustrate the
Kennedys' penchant for ``adventure,'' ``recklessness'' and
``disaster,'' the Post compares John's crash to the death of Joe
Kennedy Jr., in a World War II bombing mission and to Michael
Kennedy's fatal ``crash'' into a tree while playing football on
skis.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek's Jonathan Alter likens John's flying to his father's
piloting of a PT boat in the war: ``They both grabbed life by the
lapels.'' These comparisons obscure the difference between risking
one's life in war, as Jack and Joe did, and risking it playing
football.
</P>
<P>
   Which tradition does John belong to? He was flying to a
wedding--a more commendable pursuit than the one that killed
Michael, but nothing like the war that killed Uncle Joe.
</P>
<P>
   4. What precautions were taken? Critics point out that John
Kennedy was an inexperienced pilot, took off after sunset, wasn't
licensed to fly in the poor visibility he encountered Friday, flew
the more dangerous route over water, and never contacted air
traffic controllers for assistance. His defenders point out that he
was trained at a top-flight facility and usually brought along a
flight instructor but that Friday's weather reports offered no
warning of poor visibility. Barnicle, like Cohen, argued that to
accuse Kennedy of ``poor judgment is way out of bounds,'' because
``he could just as well have been killed in a subway accident.''
</P>
<P>
   By enumerating Kennedy's usual precautions, his defenders show
that he was more careful than many of his cousins. But against that
background--and comments from other pilots who say they decided the
weather was too dangerous for flying--his decisions last Friday
appear all the more unwise. John Kennedy would be alive today if he
had taken his usual precautions--and certainly if he had taken a
train instead.
</P>
<P>
   5. Was the protagonist morally reckless? Recklessness theorists
associate John Kennedy's ``lack of judgment'' with his cousins'
debauchery. According to the Post, the family's ``fearless
adventurism has sometimes played out in scandal: for example, the
drug problems of Robert Jr., Patrick and David ... or Michael's
notorious involvement with his teenage babysitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Time says of John, ``If he was less reckless than his cousins,
it was not saying much; there were friends who turned down the
invitation to take to the skies with him.'' The magazine quotes one
family member who said, ``The Kennedy story is really about karma,
about people who broke the rules and were ultimately broken by
them.''
</P>
<P>
   This critique confuses different dimensions of ``judgment'' and
``breaking the rules.'' To err in assessing the weather is human;
to sleep with the baby sitter is depraved. John Kennedy knew the
difference: In 1997, he observed in George that his cousin Michael
had ``surrendered his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Recklessness theorists such as Newsweek--which casually
associated John's ``succession of stunning girlfriends'' as a
bachelor with his father's ``sexual snacking'' as a married
man--show far worse judgment than John ever did.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle and other Kennedy defenders, however, gloss over the
same moral differences when they demand that the nation stand with
Uncle Teddy and mourn the loss of ``another Kennedy'' instead of
``assessing judgment.'' Judgment is precisely what should be
assessed. John Kennedy should never have taken off last Friday. The
risk was unnecessary, and two people who entrusted him with their
lives are dead because he screwed up.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not confuse one catastrophic misjudgment with a
pattern of decadence. John Kennedy's death was far less noble than
the tragedies suffered by the best men in his family--and far less
blameworthy than the tragedies wrought by the worst.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Except for political junkies, most people can tell you precisely
one thing about George W. Bush: His father used to be president. No
wonder he's in major-league denial when asked about matching
Poppy's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm not
really thrilled about talking about,'' he told The New York Times,
revealing, in a classic Freudian protestation, more than he
realized.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be impossible for anyone in Bush's shoes not to
bear an especially heavy Oedipal burden. The life of the only son
of a president to become president--John Quincy Adams--illustrates
why.
</P>
<P>
   W. has followed in his father's footsteps by attending Phillips
Academy and Yale, getting into the oil business, running for
Congress, and now, seeking the presidency. ``JQA'' (as he was
called to distinguish him from Dad) had the more daunting task of
succeeding his father--the nation's first vice president and second
president, and an eminent political theorist--as one of the great
statesmen of the early republic.
</P>
<P>
   If W. were to learn even a little about JQA's unhappy plight, he
might well realize the virtues of psychological self-analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The senior John Adams was a leader in the American Revolution
and wrote the influential tracts ``Thoughts on Government'' and
``Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States
of America.'' He saw no reason his eldest son, born in 1767,
shouldn't attain equal greatness. Adams set a rigorous course of
study for young John, assigning him, for example, to read
Thucydides' ``History of the Peloponnesian War'' in the original
Greek, at age 10.
</P>
<P>
   Morally stern, Adams also admonished his son to make ``a good
account'' of himself, and continued to hector him well into his
adulthood. ``You come into life with advantages which will disgrace
you if your success is mediocre,'' Adams wrote to the 27-year-old
JQA in 1794. ``If you do not rise to the head not only of your
profession but of your country, it will be owing to your own
Laziness, Slovenliness and Obstinacy.''
</P>
<P>
   JQA didn't need his father's entreaties to work hard. He had
internalized them fully, and his copious diary entries reveal
neurotically high ambitions and an obsessional level of
self-reproach for not meeting them. ``Indolence, indolence, I fear,
will be my ruin,'' he wrote at age 20, voicing a refrain he
repeated throughout his hard-working life.
</P>
<P>
   At that same young age, he awoke one morning with a hangover
after a night spent caroling with friends, during which, he
recorded, ``the bottle went round with an unusual rapidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his self-flagellation, JQA learned self-control
early. It took George W. Bush 39 years and many more hangovers
before he learned the same. Of course, JQA's paternally instilled
perfectionism sparked a lifelong case of clinical depression. W.'s
growing-up experiences sparked a born-again Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   JQA benefited as well as suffered from his father's position.
Where George Herbert Walker Bush furnished his son with contacts in
politics and in the oil business, John Adams extended to his son
equally rare opportunities. As a boy, JQA accompanied Adams on a
diplomatic mission to Paris and, through that experience, won the
assignment, at age 14, to be secretary and interpreter on another
assignment in St. Petersburg, in Russia. These jobs primed JQA for
his later diplomatic career.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as the intellectually undistinguished George W.
doubtless got into Yale as a ``legacy,'' JQA, though he had
mastered Thucydides, surely wasn't penalized for his father's name
when he was admitted to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   For JQA's earliest intellectual triumphs, too, Adams senior was
at least inadvertently responsible. At age 24, JQA wrote his first
major work of political philosophy, in the manner of many works
then, under a classical pseudonym, ``Publicola.'' A rejoinder to
Tom Paine's Rights of Man, ``Letters From Publicola'' emphasized
the role of passion, not reason, in governing men's political
behavior. Its conservative tone and polished style--compared
admiringly to Edmund Burke--led many to assume that John Adams had
authored it. The case of mistaken identity fed its popularity and
launched JQA's career as a political essayist.
</P>
<P>
   The episode stands as yet another eerie precursor to George W.'s
life: As a much-overlooked New York Times story noted last spring,
W. became the GOP front-runner largely because many people who told
pollsters they favored Bush were ``actually thinking of the
father''; the confusion triggered a virtuous cycle of high poll
numbers, improved fund-raising, and endorsements that has lifted W.
above the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, JQA came both to revere and to recoil from the
magnitude of his father's accomplishments. In a 1793 address, JQA
vowed that while ``the copious treasures'' of fame and achievement
``have already been gathered by the hands of genius,'' he and his
generation would still stay true to ``the precious memory of the
sages.'' Though he was ostensibly paying tribute to the
Constitution, it was not hard to hear the deep filiopietism beneath
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, JQA struggled to stake out his own terrain as
a lawyer or, his ultimate fantasy, a poet. Naturally awed by his
father's achievements, he swore he didn't want a career in politics
(again, not unlike the way W. pursued business after failing to get
elected to Congress at age 31). Yet no sooner had Adams undertaken
his pursuits as an attorney than his father, recently elected as
the nation's first vice president, informed him that George
Washington had named the young man minister to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The news dashed JQA's hopes for independence from Dad. ``I wish
I could have been consulted before it was irrevocably made,'' he
said of the appointment. ``I rather wish it had not been made at
all.'' The senior Adams, meanwhile, took the occasion to chide his
son to start paying attention to how he dressed.
</P>
<P>
   When John Adams became president in 1797, he appointed his son
to the even more prestigious post of minister to Prussia. In both
diplomatic missions, JQA received laudatory reviews, and he was
marked as an important leader in his own right. It could only have
served as a painful reminder of his father's still-greater fame,
then, when, after losing the election of 1800 to Thomas Jefferson,
Adams recalled his son so as not to give his rival the satisfaction
of deciding whether JQA should continue in his post.
</P>
<P>
   Following his career as a diplomat, John Quincy went on to
ascend ever higher in politics. He served as a Massachusetts state
senator and a U.S. senator, and then, during James Monroe's
presidency, as secretary of state, where he was largely responsible
for formulating the principles behind the Monroe Doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced in what was then clearly the No. 2 position in
government, JQA was the presumptive front-runner in the 1824
presidential race, though it was Andrew Jackson who won a plurality
(yet not the necessary majority) of electoral votes. Adams won the
presidency only because Henry Clay backed him in the run-off in the
House of Representatives, but Adams never lived down (false) rumors
that he and Clay had cut a ``Corrupt Bargain.'' He unwisely fed the
rumors and harmed his own reputation by naming Clay his secretary
of state.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Adams' relatively unremarkable presidency, however, he
rebounded as no other ex-president ever has. He ran for Congress
from Massachusetts and, revitalized, served for 18 years--notably
helping to overturn the shameful ``gag rule'' that forbade the
reading of anti-slavery petitions on the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   It takes little imagination to speculate that JQA felt liberated
to enjoy this second career only because on July 4, 1826, midway
through JQA's presidency, his venerated old man passed away.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of JQA's life is that, for all his spectacular
achievements, he was doomed to feel inadequate next to his
larger-than-life father. W. should only have such problems.

   CALIF-SCHOOL (Los Angeles) _ It is a classic Los Angeles tale of
sunny civic boosterism and noir real estate speculation. Built atop
an abandoned oil field, despite repeated red flags and warnings,
the Belmont Learning Center, which would be the most expensive
public high school ever, may never be finished - and if it is, no
one may want to go to school there. The problem: officials say
there may be no way to vent away seeping methane gas and other
hazards to make it safe enough to occupy. This week, the newly
elected majority of the Los Angeles Board of Education voted to
create a special commission to recommend whether to abandon the
more than $200 million project, after $125 million has already been
spent, or spend millions more in an effort to make it work. By Todd

This is especially true in urban centers like Sao Paulo, where
unemployment is at a record high. Representatives from car-armoring

percent this year, to $70 million. By Simon Romero.

`BONANNO': SKILLFULLY DONE BOILERPLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BONANNO: A GODFATHER'S STORY 
Directed by: Michel Poulette 
Teleplay by: Thomas Michael Donnelly 
Based on the books: ``A Man of Honor'' by Josephy Bonanno and
``Bound By Honor'' by Bill Bonanno. 
Starring: Martin Landau, Bruce Ramsay, Tony Nardi, Edward James
Olmos, Jessica Welch, Claudia Ferri, Philip Bosco and Costas
Mandylor. 
On: Showtime 
Date: Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story'' is a two-part, nearly five-hour
miniseries based on material provided by former very real-life New
York crime boss Joseph Bonanno, who is 94, and produced for
Showtime by his son Bill, who was himself a made man in the Mafia.
Much of it is a kind of richly staged visual boilerplate, that is,
scenes of crime council meetings, barbershop assassinations,
opulent weddings, and so on, mostly involving men in splendid
period suits and hats, that could have been ripped from any of a
number of ``Godfather''-related movies.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, a considerable amount of this ambitious
epic, airing Sunday and Monday nights at 8 p.m. and employing a
huge cast of competent actors and numerous evocative locations
including Sicily, is skillfully directed and persuasively
performed.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the scenes featuring Tony Nardi as the mature
New York Mafia don (the virtually century-spanning story uses three
main actors to play Bonanno) are first-rate. In a film that
involves a lot of highly charged eye work _ gazes that convey
menace or purposelfulness or both, squints that convey commands,
looks communicating varieties of love and pride _ Nardi, the
centerpiece of Part 2, is the best. Where others of the movie's
mafiosi sometimes even flirt unintentionally with comedy in the
process, Nardi seems centered, subtly omniscient, under rigid
self-control. He conveys precisely what the film intends _ an image
of a proud, politic leader and strategist who fulfills, despite the
blood on his hands, a real if skewed version of the American dream.
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno's power was considerable, reaching not just into the New
York police force and union halls, but into the mayor's office and
beyond. American history according to the Bonannos posits
intriguing collaborations between major crime figures and our top
and most exalted elected leaders. Much is made in ``Bonanno'' of
the Mafia's critical involvement in John F. Kennedy's presidential
election. The movie also dramatically asserts that at least three
crime families (not including Bonanno's) took part in JFK's
assassination, furious that his father, Joseph, was unable to
control the administration's assault on organized crime spearheaded
by Robert Kennedy as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story'' sweeps across the 20th century
from his humble roots in coastal Sicily to his illegal immigration
into the United States, through his bootlegging Brooklyn days
during Prohibition, to his secret, patriotic assistance in the war
effort during World War II, to his prominent position as
power-broker among New York's infamous mafia families, and beyond.
The story is told in what we are safely to believe resemble
Bonanno's own words, narrated by actor Martin Landau, who appears
occasionally as the aged, now retired, don.
</P>
<P>
   The writing, by Thomas Michael Donnelly, who interviewed Bonanno
for weeks for the movie, captures an authentic sounding voice. ``I
undertook missions,'' the old don recounts, for example, ``that
required the use of force.'' His speech is formal and euphemistic,
evoking a savvy and cautious politician rather than a wiseguy.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its many fragmentary qualities and the obviously
huge effort this miniseries represents, it finally just doesn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how polished many of the elements are, the movie
simply isn't able to hold one's attention for more than a few
minutes at a time. It is, for the most part, a long and tensionless
string of events, scenes whether painfully familiar or relatively
effective that never accumulate the kind emotional or narrative
density epics like this depend on for effect.
</P>
<P>
   As good as Nardi is (and Bruce Ramsay, who looks like a more
refined Tony Danza, isn't bad at all as the younger Bonanno), we
never really feel identified with the character. I suspect this has
something to do with the implicitly pleading tone of the teleplay,
the Bonannos' self-redeeming version of their illegitimate,
sometimes murderous, route to wealth and power. But it has a great
deal more to do with another, more basic flaw in the teleplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story'' mistakenly relies on simple
chronology for its structure, as if cataloguing scores of
presumably real-life events in the order they happened will
automatically produce drama. What's missing is any sense of the
relative weight of the incidents or their dramatic relationship to
one another as they try but fail to generate a lasting impression
of Mr. Bonnano and his allegedly ``honorable'' way of life.

THE STORY WAS BESIDE THE POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the core of the Kennedy brand is hope. ``The dream shall
never die,'' said Edward Kennedy at the 1980 Democratic National
Convention. ``I think we can do better,'' said Robert Kennedy,
campaigning for the presidency in 1968. ``Let us begin,'' said
President Kennedy at his inauguration in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of a better day has always been the basic theme of
Kennedy politics. It is that hope that has connected them to local
and national electorates. And it is what has set them apart,
because unlike other political families, the Kennedys have seen
their fondest hopes dashed by gunfire. Still they returned, the
promise unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The death of John F. Kennedy Jr. had no bearing on the civic or
public life of America; he edited a magazine and lived quietly with
his wife in New York City. But it resonated across the subterranean
life of the nation, evoking hard drive memories of hopes dashed and
lives lost too soon and forever.
</P>
<P>
   There's an entire generation of baby-boomers who have either
turned 50 or are fast approaching the mark who regret many of the
decisions they have made in life. Some of them are wealthy, half
are divorced, and few of them believe that they have made the most
of what they were given.
</P>
<P>
   For them, President John F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr.
serve as chronological bookends, bracketing that time in their
lives when they had the most to give and the least to lose. For too
many, the view back from the son to the father is a distressing
sight. Staring at images on a television screen, the dread they
feel is amplified by what now occurs on that screen.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the decline of the quality of American life more
pronounced than on television. President John Kennedy used the
medium to advance his cause and to engage the nation in a more
direct political exchange. Today, broadcast networks and cable news
operations use the death of his son to ratchet up their Nielsen
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday morning, Barbara Walters abandoned the Hamptons
and came clucking back to ABC News headquarters in New York,
talking on her cell phone down the Long Island Expressway about her
``personal friendship'' with John F. Kennedy and what his death
meant to the country.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, during President Kennedy's era, when Barbara
Walters was just the host of a morning chat show. No one cared what
she thought. No one would have thought to ask. But over the years,
through some terrible Hogarthian transformation, she has somehow
become Baba Wawa, the insufferably overbearing mother hen,
smothering us with her claustrophobic self-importance and faux
concern.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to ABC News on Saturday for one and only one reason
_ to get ratings. In this task, her colleagues Tom Brokaw, Dan
Rather, Peter Jennings, Bernard Shaw, and the others joined her.
The kid was dead. There was money to be made and face time to be
had.
</P>
<P>
   The story, such as it was, was entirely beside the point. Over
the weekend, there was virtually no news, except for shards of
wreckage washing up on the beach. Old-fashioned reporters like Bob
Hager of NBC News easily handled what news there was. The rest of
what passed for news coverage last weekend had nothing to do with
``journalism'' and everything to do with profiteering on celebrity
death.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to mourn the death of someone you do not know.
Since very few people knew John Kennedy, only very few could truly
mourn his passing. But this basic fact was lost along with so many
others. ``A nation mourns,'' said Brian Williams, pandering to what
he imagined the moment required. It required only that he stop
yammering, but he couldn't help himself, and he yammered on.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Newsweek magazine hit the stands with an issue
largely devoted to Kennedy's death. The magazine soon will publish
a commemorative issue with more extensive photography and a few
more details of John's demise. The reason they will do so is
because The Washington Post Co. made over $2 million on its
commemorative issue about the death of Princess Diana. Its
executives figure, probably correctly, that the company stands to
make as much as $3 million on a JFK Jr. issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this bazaar, it was Caroline Kennedy who
redeemed the moment. The networks and cable outlets would have paid
her millions of dollars to sit for an interview; in the event, they
staked out her house and bombarded her answering machine. She said
nothing. And in so doing, she reminded us all of what it was and is
about the Kennedy family that we most admire; their loyalty, their
strength in the face of adversity and their unshakeable belief,
despite all evidence to the contrary, in the promise of a better
day.

IF THERE IS A PARADISE, IT MAY BE VERY NEAR

   The secret to happiness, it turns out, may not be wealth or
power. Or love or success or faithful friendship. Or Ray Charles
crooning ``Georgia on My Mind'' or even chocolate mousse.
</P>
<P>
   Finding happiness may mean going no further than your very own
forehead _ the left prefrontal cortex of your brain, to be exact.
The more the sparks fly from this sliver of gray matter, the more
electrical impulses it generates, the happier you are.
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion of Richard J. Davidson, a professor of
psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, and others who have examined adults, children, infants,
even Rhesus monkeys. Over the last several years, they have tested
perky, enthusiastic people and pessimistic, morose ones. The
results are always the same. People blessed with effervescent left
prefrontal cortices are much more likely to be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson is part of a small band of pioneers who have set out
over the last decade to discover what many philosophers but few
scientific researchers have bothered to ask: What is it, exactly,
that makes us happy?
</P>
<P>
   They are marshaling all the most sophisticated scientific
techniques: searching for a genetic basis for happiness, brain
imaging to pinpoint the spot on the brain where happiness resides,
and in-the-field surveys to try to understand which activities or
stimuli make people more or less happy. And they are interested in
a range of possible applications. How does happiness affect
physiological symptoms like stress and heart disease? Can drugs be
used effectively to make unhappy people happy? Are our brains coded
from birth for a certain level of happiness, or can they be altered
by experiences when we are young, or even as adults?
</P>
<P>
   This is revolutionary stuff, not only for biologists but also
for psychologists, who have concentrated much of this century on
pathology, obsession, melancholy and angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look in a psychology textbook,'' said Daniel Kahneman, a
professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University
and another happiness sleuth. ``There are a lot of pages devoted to
anxiety and depression. Happiness might not even be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Norbert Schwarz, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, said it had historically been tough to get grants to
study what tickles our fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're deciding whether to fund research,'' Schwarz said,
``it seems much more important to say you want to help people not
to get depressed than to say you want to help people enjoy their
dinner more.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, happiness research is on the upswing. Chock it
up to the Don't Sweat the Small Stuff movement, experts say, or to
the emphasis on physical health and ``wellness'' that has us
smoking less and Stairmastering more.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness, it goes without saying, is highly subjective and some
researchers are trying to better define and measure this squishy
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. Diener, a University of Illinois psychologist who
conducts happiness research, said in an interview: ``We're trying
not to just ask people how happy they are in general, but to
document it at specific points. Happiness is how frequently you're
happy, not how intensely you're happy. Having some peaks in there
is nice _ it's certainly not bad _ but if you have a peak, it could
be because you're unhappy and then you had something happen to make
you super happy. Then you have to go back to the normal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Argyle, a psychologist at Oxford University, has found
some common threads. Money, he says, makes little difference to
happiness, except for people who are very poor. People on the job
are happiest when they have good relationships with coworkers and
when part of their day is spent ``wasting time, fooling around, and
sharing gossip and jokes,'' he said. And for some reason, watching
soap operas on television makes people happy (``I think they've got
imaginary friends there,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, most happiness researchers are convinced
that a healthy part of happiness is physiological and genetic.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on twins have found that ``identical twins separated from
birth are more similar in how happy they are than fraternal twins
who grew up together,'' Diener said.
</P>
<P>
   The research of Davidson and others provides some of the most
compelling evidence yet.
</P>
<P>
   People who describe themselves as optimistic, engaged, ``the
kind of people who jump out of bed in the morning and are ready to
tackle the world,'' as he put it, have consistently higher levels
of left prefrontal lobe activity. Physiologically, they also have
``higher levels of natural antibody activity _ antigens against
everything from colds and flu to cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, people who are depressed have greater activity in
their right prefrontal lobe. And children with more active right
prefrontal lobes show ``excessive wariness in response to
unfamiliar situations,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   To see whether anticipation of something good or bad makes a
difference, Davidson tested heavy smokers who were deprived of
cigarettes for a day and then shown a lighted cigarette and told
they would be able to smoke in two minutes. During those two
minutes, the smokers showed a strong increase in left prefrontal
lobe activity.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a group of people with intense fear of making
public speeches were told they would be required to do just that.
Their right prefrontal lobes went ballistic as they got closer to
making the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, drug companies have been banging on Davidson's door.
He says that some studies have found that antidepression drugs
increase left prefrontal cortex activity, although there is no
research yet on how long the effects last.
</P>
<P>
   Yet drawing the line between the physical and the psychological
is not easy. What is cause and what is effect: are people with more
prefrontal cortex activity happier or do happier people have more
prefrontal cortex activity?
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, for example, is studying whether experiences _ like
meditation _ can produce changes in prefrontal brain activity ``to
more definitively answer the question on nature vs. nurture,'' he
said. ``Data suggest there's a lot of plasticity that appears to be
present up until the time of puberty. But brain function might be
malleable even in adults.''
</P>
<P>
   He assisted in a recent study conducted with Jon Kabat-Zinn, a
meditation expert at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center
in Worcester, in which stressed-out executives of a high-powered
biotechnology company were given an eight-week course in meditation
_ one three-hour class a week and an assignment to practice 45
minutes a day. The results are not yet in, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of the Dalai Lama, Davidson is also studying
Buddhist monks, both in Tibet and Wisconsin, to see whether their
lives of meditation show up on their prefrontal lobes. ``To get
these people to do the research is very difficult,'' he added,
``They tell us if we really want to learn about meditation they
could give us instruction, and if we like it we can teach it to
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever this research will ultimately show, happiness is
clearly more than the sum of brain circuits. Researchers have
noticed, for example, that people's responses to questions about
happiness change depending on the context in which they are asked.
If asked about their lives on a sunny day, people are likely to say
they are more content than on a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, a co-editor of ``Well-Being: Foundations of Hedonic
Psychology,'' published this month by the Russell Sage Foundation,
has conducted an experiment in which some people who used a
University of Michigan copying machine found a dime that
researchers planted, while others were not given a dime to find.
</P>
<P>
   After using the copier, people were asked how happy they were
about life, and those who found a dime were consistently more
upbeat about ``their lives as a whole, the economy, that kind of
thing,'' Schwarz said. ``We've found that a dime can make you happy
for about 20 minutes. Then your mood wears off.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness guinea pigs at the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana are given Palm Pilot handheld computers, which
beep randomly several times in a day. After each beep, subjects
fill out a questionnaire rating their happiness at that moment on a
scale of one to seven. They are also asked what they were doing
when they were beeped.
</P>
<P>
   Kahneman, another co-editor of the ``Well-Being'' book, said
research on moment-to-moment happiness could help scientists figure
out all sorts of things. ``What is the mood of people when they
ride in a Washington subway versus a New York subway?'' he asked,
making a comparison between a subway that's new, clean and punctual
and one that's often not. ``What is the effect on mood of having
trees, of looking at water?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kahneman and a colleague published a paper on whether
people are happier in California or the Midwest. ``We found not a
particle of difference,'' he said. ``But everyone in California and
the Midwest thinks that people are happier in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahneman concluded that people asked about happiness often focus
on one particular point, like the fact that the climate is much
better in California. But when it comes right down to it, Kahneman
said, ``climate is just not very important to well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   There do appear to be cultural differences across countries
though.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet, it seems, was the rarest of creatures: an unhappy Dane.
Surveys have found that ``Danes appear to be frightfully happy,''
said Argyle, citing a study in which 65 percent of the Danes
interviewed said they were satisfied with life. By contrast,
``Italians and French seem miserable,'' he said, with only 10
percent giving life a thumb's up.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to be a pretty positive bunch, while Asians are
less sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Japan report being less happy _ probably because
they focus on the negative,'' said Diener, referring to several
cross-cultural surveys that have been done. ``They think about
their own shortcomings. Americans have bad points, but they don't
tend to look at them too much.''

 McCAIN WANTS A LANDING ON MARS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential hopeful John McCain said
Friday that landing an astronaut on Mars would be his ``highest
priority'' in the U.S. space program if he is elected to the
nation's top post.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator, a former Navy fighter pilot, told reporters
at a breakfast meeting that landing on the moon was ``one of the
really signal events'' in this country's history because of the
``spiritual and emotional impact it had on Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Although McCain criticized the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) for having ``cost overrun over cost
overrun,'' he said he would ``support something reasonable as far
as Mars is concerned. ... It would be my highest priority to land a
man on Mars.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain quipped, ``I've always been a Ray Bradbury fan. I'd like
to see if `The Martian Chronicles' are true.'' He was referring to
a popular science-fiction novel by that author.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his views on Texas Gov. George W. Bush's frequent
call for ``compassionate conservatism,'' McCain, like other
challengers of the GOP presidential frontrunner, had criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   He said of the term, ``It's a little bit nonsensical'' and then
asked, ``What is compassionate? What is conservative?'' Speaking of
the two words together, he suggested that they are ``redundant.''
But he said people generally do not have enough compassion for the
poor and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to standard Republican tenets, he added: ``I believe
it's compassionate to lower taxes, have less government and allow
the free market to work.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who endured 5 1/2 years of torture and solitary
confinement in Vietnam after his plane was shot down in 1967 and is
known as a hawk on defense, accused his colleagues in Congress of
failing to authorize adequate military salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that 10,000 military families are on food stamps, he
said, ``It's disgraceful. Our recruiting suffers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old senator, now in his third term, also criticized
President Clinton for Democratic fund-raising tactics that he said
had ``debased'' the institutions of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scandal in Washington was not Monica Lewinsky,'' McCain
said, referring to the former White House intern whose affair with
Clinton was at the core of a Republican effort to remove the
president from office. ``The scandal was the debasing of government
institutions'' through questionable fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   McCain attacked the Clinton administration for allowing big
Democratic contributors to stay overnight in the Lincoln bedroom of
the White House and for selling seats on official trade missions to
supporters. He also criticized the Democratic National Committee
for accepting contributions that turned out to be from agencies of
the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally every institution of government was up for sale,''
he said. ``There was not an institution in this country that they
were not willing to sell to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Clinton's continued high popularity ratings despite
the accusations of wrongdoing, McCain compared him to the cartoon
roadrunner and Republicans to Wiley Coyote, who was always trying _
and failing _ to catch him or blow him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we're about to get him, we fall off a cliff. We run
harder and never catch him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his own candidacy, McCain said he is not waiting for
Bush to stumble but is simply trying to get his message out. The
message includes his constant plea for overhauling the campaign
finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system has become so broken that the special interests
override the public interests,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded he doesn't have enough Senate votes to pass the
campaign finance legislation he has authored with a liberal
Democrat, Sen. Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, but he said
support is building.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has encountered strong opposition to the measure
from his fellow Republicans, said his presidential quest ``is not a
standard campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to attract a lot of independent voters,'' he
said. ``We're not going after the traditional base of the
Republican Party.''

these people to do the research is very difficult,'' he added,
``They tell us if we really want to learn about meditation they
could give us instruction, and if we like it we can teach it to
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever this research will ultimately show, happiness is
clearly more than the sum of brain circuits. Researchers have
noticed, for example, that people's responses to questions about
happiness change depending on the context in which they are asked.
If asked about their lives on a sunny day, people are likely to say
they are more content than on a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, a co-editor of ``Well-Being: Foundations of Hedonic
Psychology,'' published this month by the Russell Sage Foundation,
has conducted an experiment in which some people who used a
University of Michigan copying machine found a dime that
researchers planted, while others were not given a dime to find.
</P>
<P>
   After using the copier, people were asked how happy they were
about life, and those who found a dime were consistently more
upbeat about ``their lives as a whole, the economy, that kind of
thing,'' Schwarz said. ``We've found that a dime can make you happy
for about 20 minutes. Then your mood wears off.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness guinea pigs at the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana are given Palm Pilot handheld computers, which
beep randomly several times in a day. After each beep, subjects
fill out a questionnaire rating their happiness at that moment on a
scale of one to seven. They are also asked what they were doing
when they were beeped.
</P>
<P>
   Kahneman, another co-editor of the ``Well-Being'' book, said
research on moment-to-moment happiness could help scientists figure
out all sorts of things. ``What is the mood of people when they
ride in a Washington subway versus a New York subway?'' he asked,
making a comparison between a subway that's new, clean and punctual
and one that's often not. ``What is the effect on mood of having
trees, of looking at water?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kahneman and a colleague published a paper on whether
people are happier in California or the Midwest. ``We found not a
particle of difference,'' he said. ``But everyone in California and
the Midwest thinks that people are happier in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahneman concluded that people asked about happiness often focus
on one particular point, like the fact that the climate is much
better in California. But when it comes right down to it, Kahneman
said, ``climate is just not very important to well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   There do appear to be cultural differences across countries
though.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet, it seems, was the rarest of creatures: an unhappy Dane.
Surveys have found that ``Danes appear to be frightfully happy,''
said Argyle, citing a study in which 65 percent of the Danes
interviewed said they were satisfied with life. By contrast,
``Italians and French seem miserable,'' he said, with only 10
percent giving life a thumb's up.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to be a pretty positive bunch, while Asians are
less sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Japan report being less happy _ probably because
they focus on the negative,'' said Diener, referring to several
cross-cultural surveys that have been done. ``They think about
their own shortcomings. Americans have bad points, but they don't
tend to look at them too much.''

for Sunday, July 25, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   GUN-CONTROL-REVIEW (Undated) _ The perverse effect of gun
control laws: concern about gun violence stirs legislative interest
in gun control; the ensuing controversy energizes demand for guns
among people who fear they may soon disappear from stores;
manufacturers and distributors build up inventories to handle the
new business; gun control measures that eventually pass are deeply
compromised; the result is a net increase in gun ownership. By
David C. Anderson. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-JEWS-REVIEW (Cambridge, England) _ Iran's arrest of 13
Iranian Jews on spying charges earlier this year was a menacing
sign that bigger trouble might lie ahead _ trouble that could lead
to the last Jewish community of any size in the Middle East outside
Israel following others into virtual oblivion. A look at the
history of troubles of Jews in Mideastern countries other than
Israel. By John F. Burns. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category (unless otherwise noted)
</P>
<P>
   SEXISM-VOCABULARY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Misogyny, a term referring
to men's hatred of women, has long been in common use, but
misandry, a term referring to women's hatred of men, has not, and
appears in few dictionaries. But misandry is currently being seen,
if not heard, more than ever, reflecting an escalation in the
behavior it describes. Misandrous humor is now politically correct.
By Elin Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   MAKESHIFT-SHRINES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some see kitschy makeshift
shrines for victims of publicized tragedy, such as John Kennedy
Jr., as distasteful exhibitionism, another version of venting on
talk radio or confessing sleazy secrets on daytime TV. Others
believe that our celebrity culture has enabled people to replace
the joy and heartbreak of real intimacy with phony _ and
undemanding _ emotional connections. By Jane Gross.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-RIVALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For all the accepted wisdom that
George W. Bush will be the Republican presidential nominee, nine
other candidates are persevering and insisting that the race has
not ended before it began. They all (mostly with straight faces)
happily spin scenarios of how they could lasso the prize Texas
longhorn. A look at some possible scenarios. By Richard L. Berke.
(`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   STRIP-SEARCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Recent court decisions
restricting correction officials' authority to conduct strip
searches may force them to rethink a policy that has been effective
in keeping drugs and weapons out of detention centers and reducing
violence in jails. Critics say the officials who authorized
searches later judged illegal either misunderstood, ignored or were
unaware of established legal boundaries defining who could be
strip-searched. By Kevin Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO-CAMERAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why would professional
athletes, who have spent their careers striving for the celebratory
moments that follow a championship victory, opt instead to stand on
the sidelines videotaping teammates as they jump and scream and
enjoy the moment? To these children of the postmodern,
media-drenched age, is recording the mement more important than
being a part of it? By Ed Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   ANTHROPO-ANIMALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Making animals human: Seeing
a highly intelligent creature like a dolphin or a chimpanzee,
people cannot resist imputing to it whatever human feelings would
be appropriate for the context. This is probably part of our
genetic programming. The whole art of living in social groups,
after all, is to figure out the intentions of other members and to
act accordingly. People do this without thinking, and almost any
fellow mammal will trip the reflex. By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   TASTELESS-TV-ADS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ One sign of the
coarsening of culture is gross-out TV commercials. An increasing
number of ads follow the same rationale that films and TV shows do:
If you shock with crudeness, lewdness or violence, people pay
attention, especially those who equate frankness with hipness.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-INTERVENTION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Suppose the United States
and Europe responded to the charges arising from Africa that they
are indifferent racists willing to spend $1.50 per Kosovo refugee
but only 11 cents per African refugee. Suppose they actually tried
to make peace in an African war. Are there any lessons from Kosovo
that would work in Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone or Eritrea? By
Donald G. McNeil Jr. (`i' category)

   The New York Times News Service plans the following articles
from the Style section for use Sunday, July 25, and thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-BESSETTE-REMEMBER (Undated) _ This is what I know about
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: She liked to touch people. She liked to
sit and hold a friend's hand while they were talking. There was
nothing fake or sloppy about the gesture. She held on. She wrapped
her hands completely around another person's. She meant it. By
Cathy Horyn.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY-REMEMBER (Undated) _ I never knew what to say to John
Kennedy Jr. We were at Brown together and he lived off campus with
some of my friends, but I didn't know him personally. I can't say
if it was respect for his privacy or my own pride that kept me from
pushing our social connections to make him aware of me in the years
that followed. By Bob Morris.
</P>
<P>
   CONDE-NAST-MOVE (New York) _ Now that Conde Nast's high-gloss
magazine empire has officially relocated from 350 Madison Avenue to
its new headquarters at 4 Times Square, complaints of culture shock
are surfacing among black-clad magazine editors unable to find a
restaurant that serves a decent protein shake. By Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   COUTURE-FASHION (Paris) _ What with a white-smocked Andre Leon
Talley squiring around a crew from ABC, another from the BBC
following Anna Wintour, and Puff Daddy simultaneously promoting his
new record and posing for a fashion shoot by Annie Leibovitz, all
at the same late-night party, the autumn haute couture shows
certainly were the media equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel.
By Cathy Horyn. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   NEWPORT-TOURISTS (Undated) _ Some Rhode Island state agency
stuck a car counter outside my driveway, on the dogleg of Bellevue
Avenue, just past Doris Duke's mansion, Rough Point, the last in a
long line of the alternately grim and lovely mansions on Newport's
Gilded Age strip. Between noon on a Saturday and noon on Sunday,
8,000 cars choked past; by 7:45 Monday morning, the counter had
ticked off 3,000 more. But these are not the most telling details
about summer in a city through which more than 600,000 tourists
pass between May and October, eager for a look at the excesses of
the last century. By Penelope Greene.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-LEHANE (Boston) _ A night out with Dennis Lehane, the
mystery novelist, who writes about the working-class Irish. By
Frank Bruni. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Gardening in shade demands patience
and experience. Most of the world of gardening revolves around the
sun, but the woods are full of beautiful surprises. Shade gardens
tend toward the idiosyncratic: they express the plant connoisseur's
appreciation of the select, of fine foliage, of all the nuances of
green. By Marty Ross.

 &HT;    RUSSIA'S SUMMER OF DISCOMFORT UNDER A BRUTAL SUN
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW Swarms of locusts are devouring crops in Russia's
southern growing regions. In the arctic, the heat is prompting
polar dolphins to beach themselves in a suicidal panic rather than
endure the unusually warm water in the White Sea.
</P>
<P>
   In between, in Moscow and throughout Russia's midsection, the
record-breaking summer heat wave has sparked widespread forest
fires, accidental deaths by drowning and at least a few murders.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Russia has had big problems, mainly economic and
political. Its troubles in this searing summer, the hottest since
record-keeping began 120 years ago, seem utterly biblical
pestilence, drought, fire and brimstone. In some parts, the ground
itself is burning as the heat has caused peat bogs to spontaneously
catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Even Russia's vacationing president, in the habit of making
things bend to his will, has been affected by the weather. Last
week, Boris Yeltsin was chased out of his country retreat for a
house closer to Moscow after nearby forest fires threatened to
choke the region with smoke.
</P>
<P>
   June, the hottest month on record and the driest since 1956,
regularly saw high temperatures into the 90s. Rainfall was less
than 15 percent of the average.
</P>
<P>
   An intermittent pattern of showers and thunderstorms has cooled
July somewhat. But temperatures remain abnormally high in a country
unaccustomed to summer; the average high for July in Moscow is 74
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Only a select group of Russians is enjoying the unusual weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is very, very good,'' declared Mikhail Bakinov, a
Moscow appliance salesman peddling air conditioners by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Winter is expertly handled in Russia with fur coats, snowplows
and centuries of experience in coping with frigid temperatures and
heaps of ice and snow.
</P>
<P>
   Summer is another matter. According to one survey, only 3
percent of homes in Moscow have air conditioning, a city of 12
million mostly living in crowded apartment blocks. Muscovites have
flocked to the rivers and ponds to cool off, though most Russians
never receive swimming instruction as children.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow alone, more than 200 people have drowned since June 1,
most of them seeking to beat the heat with a deadly combination of
alcoholic beverages while swimming in rivers and ponds. Of Moscow's
110 Soviet-era swimming pools, only about 30 are still operating.
Most were closed for lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dead are men and most of them were legally drunk,
authorities said. Statistics show that five times as many Russians
die by drowning in a given summer compared to Americans. Last year,
25,000 Russians perished in the water, compared to 5,000 in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if people have a death wish,'' said lifeguard
Mikhail Solyonov, shaking his head while speaking of the lethal
mixture of alcohol and water.
</P>
<P>
   Fires, drought and insects have affected more than 1 million
acres of farmland, prompting officials to predict another bleak
harvest this fall and a need for further food aid from the United
States and the European Union, who supplied $1.5 billion in the
past year. Russia consumes 70 million tons of grain a year. This
year's forecast predicts a yield of 55 to 58 million tons, after a
dismal 1998 that produced only 47.8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow and other cities, health officials have issued
warnings about air pollution as smoke from the fires drifts over
populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   The heat was decidedly unhealthy for at least two Russian women,
the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets reported. The brutal temperatures
prompted their angry husbands to kill them, according to police
files.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a man who had been married only three days stabbed
his wife to death during an argument over who would bear the heat
to go out to buy cold juice. In another, a man struck his wife on
the head with a stool after she repeatedly implored him to buy an
air conditioner. He then stuffed her body into a refrigerator ``to
cool off,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Khabarovsk region of Siberia, fires have prompted the
authorities to close the forests to visitors and set up roadblocks
to prevent cars from driving through the woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's forestry service reported this week that some 886 fires
are currently burning across nearly 2,000 square miles. The fires
are among the more than 17,000 fires reported so far this summer.
The service has committed 8,500 firefighters and 112 airplanes and
helicopters to battle the blazes in an operation firmly in the red.
The agency lacks $190,000, the estimated cost of fighting the
fires.
</P>
<P>
   The damage caused by the fires, insects and the drought _ and
the fact that Russia will again be dependent on Western food aid _
prompted the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper to suggest that
the weather has done its part to boost the Communist Party chances
in the legislative election in December, and the presidential race
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the pre-election season, the bad harvest will become a
strong argument for the leftist opposition,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Russians seem to approach the hot
temperatures as they do their economic woes resigned to the fact
that there is little they can do to change things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter will be here soon,'' said Lena, an ice cream vendor at
Moscow's zoo. ``And then we'll complain about the cold.''

NOT-SO-LITTLE MERMAID SCULPTURES DRAW CRITICISM IN GALVESTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ This island resort city seems to have a
problem with breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks ago, the Galveston City Council rejected the idea of
adopting a special ordinance to discourage public lewdness _
particularly women revealing their breasts during Mardi Gras revels
and other special events.
</P>
<P>
   Now city officials are wringing their hands over topless mermaid
sculptures going up on a beachfront hotel facade.
</P>
<P>
   The Flagship Hotel building, which sits on a pier over the Gulf
of Mexico, is owned by the city but leased to a management firm
that has hired Houston sculptor Sergio M. Pineda to redecorate the
building's exterior.
</P>
<P>
   The new design includes two-dimensional renderings of two
50-foot-tall, topless mermaids.
</P>
<P>
   Well, so far they're topless.
</P>
<P>
   The artistic project was the topic of a brief discussion during
a City Council workshop meeting this week in which City Attorney
Barbara Roberts said the city's contract with hotel operator Daniel
Weh gives the city no control over the exterior decorations unless
they compromise the building's structural integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly does not compromise the integrity of the
structure,'' Roberts told council members.
</P>
<P>
   Pineda has assured the city that when finished, the sculpture
will be in good taste. The mermaids' breasts appear so prominent
now because the work is still in progress, he told officials during
a meeting this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's asking for everyone to be patient until the project is
finished,'' Roberts told the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it's finished, he does not believe it will be offensive
to anyone,'' she said. ``However, if it is and if council would
like . . . he can come back in and cover her with fish scales.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion was laced with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first question was, `Sergio, are you sure that mythical
mermaids had such strong chins?''' Roberts said as she displayed
drawings of the project to the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might suggest clip-on blouses that say `Censored,'''
Councilman Bill Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said Weh is spending $20,000 on the hotel's exterior
redecoration in hopes of drawing more tourists to the landmark
Seawall Boulevard inn. The island resort has about 64,000 people
and is 45 miles southeast of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the size of that part of the body, you would expect them
to cost more,'' Councilwoman Lyda Ann Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Pineda said he is depicting mermaids the
way many artists have over the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``But further, I thought that these mermaid artworks should
represent what we want Galveston to be: beautiful, inviting,
seductive, robust and romantic,'' he said.

<P>
   My great-grandfather John Wesley Staples (1865-1940) was vain
about writing and scribbled even grocery lists theatrically,
gesturing grandly with the pencil and pausing between words to lick
its point. A fuss over a shopping list seems ridiculous _ until you
consider that John Wesley was born in the slaveholding South, where
educating black people was illegal until after the Civil War and
where aggressively literate blacks were seen as subversive and even
dangerous well into the 20th century. Modern writing on the role of
race in academic achievement generally discounts this history. But
the only way to grasp the extent of the problem is to acknowledge
that black literacy was obstructed as a matter of law for more than
a century.
</P>
<P>
   John Wesley's father, also named John, was enslaved in Virginia
in 1831, when the black Baptist firebrand Nat Turner led the bloody
slave rebellion that terrified the whole of the plantation South.
Slave owners blamed black literacy for the plot, and pursued what
historians have since described as a program of ``compulsory
ignorance'' to prevent slaves from colluding through written
material. A Virginia state law passed in the year of the rebellion
forbade schooling, not just for slaves but for free Negroes as well
_ forcing parents to exile their children into Northern states in
order to educate them.
</P>
<P>
   When free Negroes petitioned for relief, the Legislature passed
a deliberately vindictive statute, banishing from the state any
child who left Virginia for the purpose of learning to read and
write. Similar laws were passed quickly throughout the South and
took an enormous toll. By the time John Wesley was born, only one
in 10 Negro adults were literate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compulsory ignorance'' created a legacy of alienation from
books and reading that has had a lingering effect on
African-American achievement. The most pernicious fallout was a set
of preconceptions _ often held by both blacks and whites _ that
defined brawn work as black and brain work as an exclusively white
activity. Of the many obstacles to academic excellence,
expectations based in race have proved to be one of the most
important _ and least-studied _ factors.
</P>
<P>
   This could change with a forthcoming report from the National
Task Force on Minority High Achievement, sponsored by the College
Board. Many studies have scrutinized academic achievement among
impoverished black students. But the task force study, one of the
first of its kind, will venture into affluent areas like Evanston,
Ill., and Berkeley, Calif., to examine a disturbingly persistent
achievement gap between blacks and whites who are essentially of
the same class and economic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article by The Times' Pam Belluck examining Evanston
shows that the fallout of enforced illiteracy is still evident not
just among the black poor but in the black middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Black students who excel at school typically struggle with
racial stereotypes and conflicted notions of ethnic identity. Some
students absorb the broader society's view that they can never be
first-rate students and give up trying. Those who excel are
routinely attacked by their friends for ``selling out'' and
becoming ``white.'' Still others find themselves confronted by
teachers and counselors who cannot conceive of them as academically
inclined and discourage them from taking advanced courses.
</P>
<P>
   Black families that urge their children on are historically less
well equipped than whites to provide necessary supports. For one
thing, the black parents are most often first-generation college
graduates _ who grew up in households without books or systems that
could support first-rate academic achievement. The current crop of
black high achievers, then, is battling hostile cultural conditions
_ and traveling a course that no one in the family has traveled
before.
</P>
<P>
   The National Task Force on Minority High Achievement will study
these students at school, at home and among their peers _ in an
attempt to produce more of them, more quickly. But what is already
clear is that the leap from averageness to excellence for children
of the black middle class will require discarding attitudes and
preconceptions that were hundreds of years in the making.

BROADCASTERS MIFFED AS CABLE NETWORKS ENCROACH ON EMMY
NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Broadcasters began to get a bit huffy about
the annual Emmy Awards nominations a few years ago, when cable
networks like HBO and Showtime began racking up most of the
nominations in the categories of mini-series and
made-for-television movies.
</P>
<P>
   Last year many were really peeved when Tom Hanks' expensive
12-part series, ``From the Earth to the Moon'' for HBO, won the
Emmy for best mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   At least that space-race project was squeaky clean. This year
ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC have additional reasons to grumble about the
Emmy nominations, which were announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cable shows are now invading the most precious awards realms,
too, like best drama, best comedy and all the acting categories _
and they are doing so using levels of sex, violence and profanity
forbidden to the broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   Even in highbrow drama and nonfiction programming, cable has
begun to encroach. The A&AMP;E network received 20 nominations this
year, five more than venerable PBS. Not counting technical
categories like sound editing and hair styling, the two were even,
with 10 each. But last year A&AMP;E mustered only two nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the PBS nominations were for dance or classical music
performance productions _ two for ``Live From Lincoln Center'' and
two for ``Great Performances'' _ while A&AMP;E earned most of its nods
for two mini-series, ``Dash and Lilly'' (starring Sam Shepard as
Dashiell Hammett and Judy Davis as Lillian Hellman) and ``Horatio
Hornblower,'' and a documentary, ``The Farm: Life Inside Angola
Prison.''
</P>
<P>
   This year cable networks swept all five nominations in the
made-for-television movie category, and four of the five
nominations for lead actor, lead actress and supporting actor in a
mini-series or movie.
</P>
<P>
   And HBO alone swept the five nominations for best performance in
a variety or music program, a category in which profanity can be a
big plus, as evidenced by the nominees: George Carlin, John
Leguizamo, Dennis Miller, Chris Rock and Tracey Ullman.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ``The Sopranos'' _ the HBO drama series about a North
Jersey mobster and his two families, blood relatives and business
associates _ that caused the biggest stir in television circles
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' earned the most nominations of any show _ 16 _
including two of the five nominations for best actress in a drama,
a best actor nomination for the show's star, James Gandolfini (Tony
Soprano), a best supporting actress for Nancy Marchand (as Tony's
wicked mother) and four of the five nominations for best writing in
a drama series. (``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' got the other one.)
</P>
<P>
   While ``N.Y.P.D. Blue'' was once sharply criticized for briefly
showing a man's bare bottom (some stations refused to televise the
episode), sex, violence and profanity abound in ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   In one episode Tony Soprano takes his daughter to Maine to visit
colleges, and while she's being interviewed, he stops off to kill a
man by strangling him with wire. In another, oral sex was a theme
that managed to be both humorous and painfully sad. Both episodes
were nominated for best writing for a drama.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Marshall, president of the Television Academy of Arts and
Sciences, which conducts the awards voting, said ``The Sopranos''
was great drama not because it pushed standards of what's
acceptable on television to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's powerful writing, and they've struck a balance between
the Mafia violence and a real humanity,'' she said. ``That's why it
broke through.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast executives understandably see a double standard,
especially when it comes time to compete for those Emmys. They know
that HBO is a network people pay extra to get and thus is entitled
to more artistic license. Yet the basic cable networks also go
unregulated by the Federal Communications Commission, while
broadcasters must hew to certain standards of propriety.
</P>
<P>
   Also, pay-cable networks like HBO, which have no advertising, do
not have to worry about Nielsen ratings, so they can cast
realistically instead of using big-name stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that as broadcasters we can get into every home in
America, and some responsibility definitely comes with that,'' said
Doug Herzog, president of Fox's entertainment division. ``But at
some level there's unfairness, because the biggest cable networks
can get into almost every home in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox may test the limits of broadcast standards this fall with a
very adult comedy called ``Action,'' a satire of Hollywood moguls
and their perverse ethics. It uses profanity but bleeps it, so the
audience can get the idea from people's lips without hearing the
words. It also has numerous sexual situations and jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Frank and detailed sexual discussions are staples of the HBO
series ``Sex in the City,'' which earned a best comedy nomination
Thursday as well as a best comedic actress nomination for its star,
Sarah Jessica Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics were surprised that the show earned a nomination
while two well-regarded first-year comedies, NBC's ``Will and
Grace'' and ABC's ``Sports Night,'' did not.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Sopranos'' muscling into the best drama category, an
often-nominated and still popular show, Fox's ``X-Files,'' got
squeezed out. (Gillian Anderson did earn her fourth nomination as
best actress.)
</P>
<P>
   But the show's creator and executive producer, Chris Carter,
said that he had had a sense that ``this would be the year for us
to get knocked off,'' and he added that this season, the seventh,
would probably be the series' last.
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy Award winners will be announced Sept. 12 in Los
Angeles.

EVEN FOR DEATH'S ESCAPEES, THE MYTH SAYS, THERE ARE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Resurrection from the dead may be the most universal of mythic
ideas: a devoted savior descends to the netherworld to restore a
loved one to life. But there is always a price to be paid: natural
law is rarely overturned without penalty and pain. Persephone must
return to Hades. Lot's wife, insufficiently awed by her rescue from
her death-ridden home, glances back and turns into a pillar of
evaporated tears. And the Christian story of resurrection leaves
the final transformation incomplete, pending the spiritual
perfection of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   This myth is also at the heart of two 400-year-old operas. In
the Chinese opera ``The Peony Pavilion,'' which is being performed
in complete 19-hour form as part of New York's Lincoln Center
Festival '99 (its last marathon performance is this weekend), the
slightly cocky young scholar Liu Mengmei brings his beloved back to
life. And in Monteverdi's ``Orfeo,'' which was given an exquisite
performance last month in a production by Trisha Brown at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, Orpheus, whose playing of the lyre could
wring tears from stones, uses his music to rescue his Eurydice from
Hades.
</P>
<P>
   This operatic coincidence is unusually resonant. Both works were
written around the same time (``Peony'' in 1598, ``L'Orfeo'' in
1607). Both became models for their respective styles of music
drama. And both, in their resurrection myths, invoke the dreamy
powers of art while alluding to its dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Consider first ``Peony,'' which, when seen in full, has the
force of a revelation. However strange the initial impression is on
Western eyes or ears _ the formal hand gestures, the eye movements,
the sweeping, sighing melismas, the percussive punctuation _ the
opera is a grand picaresque comedy. Liu's rescue of his beloved
from the Underworld is more earthy than heroic: he has to shovel
dirt out of the grave, worry about foul smells and flee with his
newly disinterred wife as a suspected grave robber. It is as if the
17th-century author, Tang Xianzu, were winking slightly at the very
idea of resurrection. Liu has more to worry about from earthly
authorities who would behead him for plundering tombs than from any
supernal force.
</P>
<P>
   And how pompous those earthly authorities and their minions are!
Liu never fails to boast of his scholarly superiority (``I am
stuffed full of knowledge''); his beloved, Du Liniang, pities the
mirror that can capture only part of her beauty; the Prefect
self-importantly quotes ancient poetry to prove his points. There
is constant deflation of pretense. Even images of natural beauty _
so central to the work's effects _ are turned into bawdy allusions.
It is as if Shakespeare's gravediggers had been set free in the
Ming dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   This seems extraordinarily mischievous given that ``Peony'' is a
``kunqu'' opera _ an elite, learned genre _ with a text peppered
with literary citations. What is also surprising is that the
penalty we expect for Liu's violation of natural law never comes.
The work seems to proclaim that anything is possible if one dreams
well enough and is willing to challenge convention.
</P>
<P>
   But the opera is also so subtle that no sooner is this impulse
celebrated than it is resisted. Everything is pomposity? Not quite.
Everything is possible? Barely. Du's resurrection always remains
somewhat creepy; her father never fully accepts her return to life.
In addition, the ritualistic performance style keeps circumscribing
desire in melancholic ceremony. The director, Chen Shi-Zheng, uses
a variety of popular and vernacular ideas in his staging _ very
little authentic kunqu material survives _ but he retains a
controlled, stylistic foundation that keeps the mischief in check.
The impression is not of unbounded freedom but of bounded
accommodation. Art may break boundaries but it also must answer to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Monteverdi may have had something similar in mind. In the myth,
Orpheus has such mastery over his art that he can use it to suspend
natural law and descend into Hades. But Monteverdi's attitude
toward Orpheus' musical powers is more ambiguous. The composer
wrote this opera at a moment of heated debate in Italy about the
nature of music: should music or text take priority? Monteverdi
believed that music had already gone too far in eclipsing its
texts. It had become overly introverted, intricate, indulgent. In
creating one of the first modern operas based on his understanding
of classical ideals, Monteverdi wanted music to serve the text, not
dominate it. It would have to acknowledge an external authority.
</P>
<P>
   But this is just what Orpheus is unable to do. He treats music
as a law unto itself, answerable to no constraints. He can't even
control his own impulses _ he ultimately glances back at Eurydice,
violating a strict edict, and so condemns her to eternal death. Nor
is Orpheus the master musician he seems. He succeeds in passing
into Hades not by seducing the ferryman, Charon, with his music,
but by inadvertently putting him to sleep. And while Orpheus
credits his music with winning over the Lord of the Underworld,
Persephone's plea is what makes the difference. Orpheus may sing
the praises of his own song, but he does not take its proper
measure; he prefers elaborate effects to simple communication. In
both his actions and his style, Orpheus acknowledges no external
authority; he insists on his absolute freedom, and ends up losing
it.
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, ``L'Orfeo'' is not a celebration of music's
seductive powers to undo death and rescue love, but an exploration
of music's limits. This is the opera's tragedy: not that Orpheus'
powers fail, but that, in their self-absorbed form, they cannot
possibly succeed. ``Peony'' ultimately sides with Monteverdi as
well. Both operas suggest that in art, as in death, there is no
escape from rules and limits. But the struggle against them ends up
becoming one of the great recurring myths of Western opera.

CONSERVATIVE SENATORS TARGET CRITICS OF CHRISTIAN COALITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)  
 (bl)  
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six conservative senators are putting the squeeze
on a group that has been highly critical of the Christian
Coalition, calling for a Justice Department investigation of
Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   The six Republicans _ Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Jeff
Sessions of Alabama, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Paul
Coverdell of Georgia, Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Sam Brownback of
Kansas _ suggest that Americans United is guilty of ``intimidating
people of faith'' in politics.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter, the senators charge that Americans United wants
to unfairly restrict political activity by churches.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are limits on what religious organizations can do
_ if they want to retain their tax-exempt status. For example,
churches can encourage their followers to vote, but they're not
supposed to endorse candidates or engage in partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   The senators contend that the fact that Americans United keeps
publicizing that distinction amounts to a ``subterfuge for a
threatened IRS review of their tax-exempt status.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United, which was
organized in 1947, described the charges as ``patently absurd'' and
said the lawmakers were only carrying the water for political ally
Pat Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have chosen to describe as intimidation is actually
an education effort designed to inform religious leaders about
federal tax law,'' Lynn wrote the senators. Lynn charged that the
men are acting at the behest of Robertson, leader of the Christian
Coalition, which was recently denied tax-exempt status because of
its pro-Republican political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for several senators denied that claim, but Robertson
met earlier this summer with GOP leaders in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is under review by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL MILESTONE
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the Christian Coalition is busy organizing its
annual conference and celebrating its 10th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Washington gathering is expected to feature an
array of Republican political leaders, especially those with their
eyes on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition conferences have become key pit stops
for Republicans courting the conservative vote. Invited speakers
this year includes George W. Bush, Steve Forbes, Lamar Alexander,
Pat Buchanan, Elizabeth Dole, Dan Quayle, Orrin Hatch and Gary
Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson described it as ``the
perfect time to celebrate our accomplishments and make ready for
the next decade.''
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL BREAUX-PAS
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., is known for reaching out to
Republicans but this seemed too much even for that consummate
deal-maker.
</P>
<P>
   A respected Washington watchdog group sent out an eye-catching
e-mail noting that Breaux crossed party lines to give $1,000 to GOP
presidential front-runner George W. Bush of Texas. Working with
Republicans is one thing, but giving them money in a high-stakes
presidential battle is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Breaux won't be drummed out of the Democratic
caucus just yet. The donation was actually from his son, John
Breaux Jr., a lobbyist with a firm headed by former Sen. Bennett
Johnston, D-La. For him, contributing to Bush was probably a smart
idea. The Bush campaign mistakenly listed Breaux Jr.'s occupation
as senator.
</P>
<P>
   HOME IS WHERE THE CASH IS
</P>
<P>
   Outside Florida, the South is not known as a particularly
fertile spot to raise political cash for national races. But
home-state and regional loyalty are combining to make other
Southern states sources of presidential dollars this time around.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, North Carolina
has been the second best fund-raising spot for hometown girl
Elizabeth Dole, providing $350,000 for her campaign, ranking it
just behind California. And Tennessee, Georgia, Florida and Alabama
join California in the top five states for Tennessee boy Lamar
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Tennessee has been the third-best cash
cow for native son Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all their totals fall well short of the record
bankroll of George W. Bush, who relied on traditional money states
such as New York and Michigan as well as Texas, California and
Florida in compiling his unrivaled war chest.

DAPPLED OR DARK, SHADE HAS ITS FAVORITE PLANTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARTY ROSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Just have this branch removed,'' my friend the rosarian
suggested matter-of-factly some years ago, offering a neat solution
to all my gardening problems.
</P>
<P>
   She was pointing to one of the long, beautiful, muscular limbs
of my distinguished backyard oak, older than our ages combined. I
removed the roses instead. Maybe one day I'll have a sunny garden,
but so far I've inherited one shady yard after another from
gardeners who, like Peter Pan, left their shadows behind when they
moved on.
</P>
<P>
   These gardeners seldom seem to leave a lasting legacy. Their
peonies become lost in the lengthening shadows as the trees they
planted grow on toward maturity. Spring bulbs persist, but lilies
withhold their blooms when the shade embraces them. Roses lose
their vigor and succumb to every passing pestilence.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, interfering with the natural growth of trees has
never been easy for me, and even as these bright gardens lose their
youthful glow, they develop the quiet, woodsy character I've come
to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have their definitions and gradations, but there are
really only two basic kinds of shade: part shade (also known as
light shade or part sun), and various local and personal
interpretations of what constitutes full shade. Plants suited to
part shade should receive up to six hours of sunlight a day during
the summer, and ideally the warm kiss of morning sun, not the
afternoon's unrelenting rays.
</P>
<P>
   On a clear day in July, the part-shade garden will seem quite
bright, but the light should be dappled and sparkling. In full
shade, the sun's direct light may penetrate for only an hour or two
here and there, as it does under my magnificent oak.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening in shade demands patience and experience. Most of the
world of gardening revolves around the sun, but the woods are full
of beautiful surprises. Shade gardens tend toward the
idiosyncratic: they express the plant connoisseur's appreciation of
the select, of fine foliage, of all the nuances of green.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Jim understands the palette of woody and herbaceous
shade plants perfectly. Anyone else would have brought in a
woodsman to deal with the forest of tall black locust trees with
redbuds beneath them at the north end of his garden in Kansas City,
Mo.
</P>
<P>
   He made a little clearing under the trees and planted a fine
blue-leaf fothergilla, smooth and oak-leaf hydrangeas, a few well
chosen hostas and a ground-cover tapestry of native perennial
ginger, lady's mantle, lamium and variegated bishop's weed.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, I had never heard of most of these plants. When I
moved to Kansas City from New Orleans, where even the shade is hot
and lushly green, a neighbor passed along a division of native
ginger to plant in the loamy skirt of leaf mold under my oak. A
garden-club friend stopped by with advice: pulmonarias, she said.
</P>
<P>
   I invested immediately in the tantalizing Mrs. Moon, a
well-known variety of this very old garden plant, with
characteristic spear-shaped, silver-spotted leaves and pink flower
buds that turn blue as the flowers open.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moon and other pulmonaria varieties arrived in four-inch
pots, and the tiny plants were quickly lost among the daffodil
foliage and later under drifts of autumn leaves. Starting in my
second spring, most of my garden budget went toward the luxury of
perennials large enough to stand up for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Every garden has its rules, though unwritten and subject to
constant negotiation. My husband, who considers hostas ``old lady''
plants, tried to ban them from our garden, but I have managed to
insinuate a few nice specimens into my beds: Frances Williams,
Hosta sieboldiana, Krossa Regal, Aureo-marginata and Elegans. These
have not escaped notice; Elegans, particularly, glowing blue in a
sweeping ribbon of perennials along the driveway, has advanced my
reputation in the family for good taste and underhandedness.
</P>
<P>
   I planted three Arum italicum bulbs in a very dark bed, and they
are unhappy there, but Virginia bluebells nearby galloped through
the dappled spring. The hellebores we planted several years ago,
whose blooms we never thought would lift themselves high enough for
the bees to notice, now stand in impressive clumps here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Bleeding heart bursts through the leaf mulch in April and
appears perfectly happy with almost no direct light. Two or three
little foam flower (Tiarella wherryi) plants that spent their first
three years doing absolutely nothing can now be relied upon for a
frothy show of white flowers on dozens of ramrod-straight flower
spikes for weeks in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Several beautiful epimedium species are well established in
moist spots and need no care whatsoever; they bloom in delicate
clouds under the daffodils, and their dangling teardrop leaves
delight me all summer long. Several toad lilies (Tricyrtis hirta)
return unfailingly every year; in the fall, their arching stems are
covered with exotic spotted blooms like orchids.
</P>
<P>
   Pale lavender autumn crocus don't seem be fully established yet,
but when it pleases them and the weather is kind, they bloom at the
front of the bed under the tricyrtis.
</P>
<P>
   In any garden, it is important not to plan too carefully, nor to
assume anything. Delicate rue anemone (Anemonella thalictroides)
caught my eye at a nursery in Tallahassee one spring and came home
in my hand baggage. It has settled quietly in a shady corner,
coming through the mulch before the crocus and blooming for months.
</P>
<P>
   The creamy, extravagant double-flowering bloodroot I had nearly
forgotten about bloomed lavishly this spring. Hardy begonia
grandis, with seeds as fine as dust, has thoroughly established
itself in a wide swath under the oak.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a long-lost Solomon's seal popped up again. I grow a
few different species of this shy woodland gem, all in deep shade,
and I carefully marked the position of Polygonatum commutatum, the
Great Solomon's seal, which is said to grow to five feet where
conditions are right.
</P>
<P>
   I'm about five feet tall myself, and I envision standing in the
arc of my Solomon's seal, the dangling blooms at my ears, surveying
a shade garden gone amok. Perhaps I'll get the chance yet.

CAROLYN BESSETTE KENNEDY: OUTWARD AND INNER BEAUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 25)  
(also see KENNEDY-REMEMBER) 
 (bl)  
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was not an icon, though she might have become one. Nor was
she the stylish successor to her mother-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, though she clearly possessed a good deal of her grace.
</P>
<P>
   Having never met the woman whose death and beauty have made her
an instant icon, I imagine Carolyn Bessette Kennedy would have been
a little appalled and a little amused to be put on a Greek pedestal
simply because she had the common sense to pull her hair off her
face (probably because her mother told her to do so when she was a
girl), and to wear good, clean clothes, preferably in black.
</P>
<P>
   This is what I know about Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: She liked to
touch people. She liked to sit and hold a friend's hand while they
were talking. There was nothing fake or sloppy about the gesture.
She didn't just touch a person once on the wrist or grab them
suddenly by the hand and then let go, the way some people will when
they grow shy or embarrassed or no longer have a need to
demonstrate their interest.
</P>
<P>
   She held on. She wrapped her hands completely around another
person's. She meant it.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that she had beautiful eyes, and it's true that
they possessed a luminosity and blueness that held people,
especially men, spellbound. But without the spontaneous warmth of
her touch she might have come across as cold and intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing: people who are busy holding another person's hand
don't have time to touch themselves. That is the first rule of
style: never fuss with yourself once you leave the house.
</P>
<P>
   She had good bones. I do not mean it in the fashion-magazine
sense, that she had prominent cheekbones, a high forehead and a
long neck, although she did. Rather, I mean it as interior
decorators do when they refer to a room's basic components _ the
things which allow you to create any number of impressions, from
austere to fancy, but which fundamentally speak to those more
enduring qualities of comfort and style.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennedy had a natural sense of composure. Anybody could see
that. When she made a public appearance with her husband, which was
more often than people might think, she knew who to approach, and
more important, what to say. She was good at small talk.
Well-brought-up women usually are, but in her case it helped that
she had an alert, lively mind.
</P>
<P>
   Did she have style? I suppose she did, although I distrusted
most of what was written about her. Once she married, and it became
obvious she wasn't going to make herself available for interviews _
and why should she? _ people started cranking out the usual blather
about what an icon she was. But it was the same typewriter going
back and forth. And what could anyone add to the story that her
silence had already made suspect?
</P>
<P>
   Second, she wore Yohji Yamamoto. This was curious, and probably
calculated _ curious because Yamamoto is about as close as you can
get to a purist's kind of fashion, and Mrs. Kennedy, though she
knew a lot about clothes and had worked at Calvin Klein, didn't
strike anyone in her married years as a fashion insider. And she
most likely knew wearing Yamamoto was going to set her apart.
Yamamoto's clothes offered a private woman, who was suddenly thrust
in the public eye, a certain amount of flexibility. They were
knowable and unknowable at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   She understood the strange, crude, hilarious irony of being in
the public's imagination. When the VH-1 Fashion Awards nominated
her in 1997, she sent a letter politely declining.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Diana, Princess of Wales, who perhaps understandably
connected her appearance to her sense of duty, Mrs. Kennedy
remained slightly aloof from the public's agitation over her. She
didn't completely satisfy its longing, and yet that, of course, was
the source of both her elegance and her fascination.
</P>

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25)  
 (af)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In Dennis Lehane's mystery novels, he taps into what he
describes as the ``comically fatalistic'' outlook of the
working-class Irish with whom he shares this corner of New England,
and to whom he unmistakably belongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feeling that God has a sense of humor,'' Lehane
explained. ``You might not be laughing, but He is.''
</P>
<P>
   God was undoubtedly enjoying a modest chuckle on this July
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was 11:30 p.m., 90 degrees, and Lehane was in the passenger
seat of a brand new rented car that called it quits on a busy
entrance ramp to Interstate 93.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put my seat belt on,'' Lehane's wife, Sheila
Lawn, announced from the back. ``For when the drunk comes along and
hits us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good thinking, honey,'' Lehane said, taking a drag on a
cigarette. ``She's always thinking. That's why she's so good to
have around.''
</P>
<P>
   They sounded suspiciously like Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro,
the fitfully involved lovers who pool wits to chase down criminals
in Lehane's increasingly popular novels. The fifth, ``Prayers for
Rain,'' about the evil influences behind a young woman's cryptic
suicide, was published by William Morrow &AMP; Co. last month.
</P>
<P>
   A four-hour tour through some of the Boston-area neighborhoods
that take such vivid, sinister shape in Lehane's pages was a
journey into the interplay of fact and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   In Dorchester, a gritty district just beyond the shadows of
Boston's glittering skyscrapers, Lehane pointed out the church
belfry that houses Kenzie's office. He nodded toward a desolate
building where Kenzie's favorite fixer, a behemoth named Bubba
Rogowski, has his lair.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane tried to stop at a dark, menacing bar that appears in the
climax of ``Darkness, Take My Hand,'' his second book, but three
lavishly muscled bouncers were keeping an overflow crowd at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Over a Budweiser at Nash's, an Irish pub down the street, he
talked about this neighborhood, where he grew up. His father toiled
here as a warehouse foreman, and his mother worked in a school
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   When Lehane, 33, uses the area's establishments in his books, he
masks the identities of the places in which untoward events occur.
</P>
<P>
   He shows less mercy toward his friends, whose real names pop up
in surprising contexts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a drug dealer, pedophile or pimp, it's probably a
buddy of mine,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   But the only time he provoked complaints from friends was when
he dared to mistreat a pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said. ``You can kill 50 people in a book,
but you kill one dog, and people are like, `How (italics)could(end
italics) you?'''
</P>
<P>
   After Dorchester, it was on to Brighton, the section where
Lehane and Ms. Lawn, 29, live. But a mile into that trip, the car
broke down. They were unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time for mints,'' Ms. Lawn said, breaking out
Tic-Tacs. It turned out to be an example of the foresight Lehane's
characters might exhibit. Ms. Lawn figured that a police officer
might check out the situation, and it was best not to invite
questions with boozy breath.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, an officer came along. But after quickly making
sure that the driver had found a way to summon help, he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if you guys had been kidnapping me?'' Ms. Lawn asked. She
jiggled the door handle. She was locked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the perfect kidnap car!'' she gasped. Lehane smiled.
Their tastes for malice and melodrama are much the same.

<P>
   Heat and humidity will scorch the Northeast and Middle Atlantic
states Saturday, as winds from the west descend the Appalachians.
Many locations near the Atlantic Seaboard will have highs in the
upper 90s.
</P>
<P>
   During the afternoon, thunderstorms will likely develop in the
mountains of the Northeast and then push toward the coast late in
the day. Some of these storms will be strong, with damaging winds
and heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front will cross the northern Great Lakes ahead of much
cooler and drier air. Along this front, a few showers and some
isolated thunderstorms will develop over northern Michigan. Farther
south, scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop in very
warm and muggy air across the southern Appalachians and in much of
the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Many locations near the western Gulf Coast will have
thunderstorms during the afternoon, as sea breezes and a
disturbance near 18,000 feet combine to promote numerous showers.
</P>
<P>
   Sea breezes will spark widely separated storms in Florida and
the eastern Gulf Coast. Heat will be oppressive in the central and
northern Plains, as several locations will have readings in triple
digits.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest monsoon will shift westward into the deserts of
Arizona, triggering scattered thunderstorms and showers. In the
Northern Rockies, a cold front pushing to the east will usher
marine air inland from the Pacific. Behind the front, a few showers
are likely in parts of Oregon, Nevada and the Bitterroots. Onshore
flow on the Pacific Northwest will promote clouds and showers.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TEMPORARY OASIS
</P>
<P>
   While Pennsylvania withered in the throes of a state-wide
drought, more than 2 inches of rain fell at Harrisburg on Thursday,
breaking the rainfall record for the date set in 1896 by more than
a quarter-inch. The deluge came in three waves of showers and
thunderstorms in the morning, afternoon and evening. In summer,
temporary oases of wetness commonly occur within large regions
suffering from drought, just as small enclaves of dryness can form
within overly wet regions. Such checkered patterns of precipitation
are a consequence of the hit-or-miss nature of summertime
thunderstorms.

TEXAS FAMILY WITNESSES KEY POINTS IN KENNEDY FAMILY SAGA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Note Hearst budget change. Story can be used for Saturday.) 
 
By TERRY KLIEWER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOCKLEY, Texas _ Tragic twists of fate for the Kennedy family
have provided unexpected opportunities for a Texas truck driver and
his son to be eyewitnesses to key points in the Kennedy saga.
</P>
<P>
   John Meagher, 54, paused Friday on a slow morning at the Hallett
Materials sand-and-gravel pit south of Hockley, about 20 miles
northwest of Houston, to reflect on the unlikelihood of it all:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there to see John Kennedy Jr. give his salute to his
father's coffin at the entrance to Arlington National Cemetery. I
was aboard the ship that provided rescue support to Apollo 11, the
guys who went to the moon to reach JFK's goal in space. And my son
is aboard the Briscoe, the destroyer that the Kennedys used for
John Jr.'s burial at sea.''
</P>
<P>
   This quiet, reflective Navy veteran admits these coincidental
crossings of path of the Meaghers, father and son, with the
Kennedys, father and son, rank among the highlights of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Call him an accidental witness to history, but his first brush
with the Kennedys was more calculated than random, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was new in the Navy, stationed at Arlington, Va., not far
from the cemetery. On the day of the funeral _ a day off for us _
my buddies went off to do other things, but I decided to put on my
dress whites and head to the cemetery to see what I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Meagher arrived just about the moment of entrance to the
cemetery for the Kennedy procession. He found a viewpoint about 50
yards from where Jacqueline Kennedy had paused with John Jr. and
Caroline, and happened to be looking on just as the young boy gave
his famously poignant salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a sad thing, but it was history,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as a Navy computer technician, he was on the U.S. carrier
Hornet in the Pacific Ocean in 1969 to pluck astronauts Neal
Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins from the sea after their
return from the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them once down (below deck) while they were quarantined
after their flight,'' he says. ``There was an area roped off for
spectators.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Thursday, his son Sean, 23, a second-generation Navy
technician on the U.S. destroyer Briscoe, has his brush with
history. The vessel was used by the Kennedy and Bessette families
for the sea burial of the ashes of John Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and
his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean was one of the crew posted in dress whites along the
perimeter of the deck as the families came aboard. He saw the
arrival but along with everyone else was sent below (deck) after
that out of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Meagher has watched the nonstop TV coverage of the JFK Jr.
tragedy on a portable TV he perches on the dash of his Kenworth
during slow moments at the sand-and-gravel pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it when I heard about John Jr. I guess no
one could. The Kennedys are such a part of American history,'' he
said. ``Their tragic luck is pretty phenomenal.''

DEMOCRACY OF ROMANS, CORRUPT BUT ARGUABLY TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To most historians of this century, the Roman republic was a
corrupt oligarchy ruled by a rich and decadent aristocracy despite
its democratic Constitution, popular assemblies and regularly
elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frozen waste theory'' is how Richard Talbert, a history
professor at the University of North Carolina, describes what has
become the conventional view. The Roman republic was a private fief
of ``a narrow aristocratic cabal,'' compared with Athens of the
fifth and fourth centuries B.C., which was revered as the
birthplace of a purer show-of-hands democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet over the last decade or so, several scholars have been
nibbling away at republican Rome's undemocratic reputation, arguing
that it was an imperfect but still recognizable democracy.
Political office was less controlled by the aristocracy than was
assumed. What's more, they say, in some ways, Rome had even more in
common with modern notions of democracy than Athens did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We neglect the open aspects of the system which produced
results the ruling classes didn't like and couldn't predict,'' said
Fergus Millar, an Oxford historian and the author of the
just-published ``The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic,''
(University of Michigan Press). ``My book is a deliberate,
one-sided attempt to shake up the conventional view of the
republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rome's democratic credentials weren't always in
doubt. After all, America's founding fathers took the Roman
Constitution, with its combination of Senate and Assembly, as their
model, not the single Athenian assembly. As James Madison wrote in
the Federalist Papers: ``Had every Athenian citizen been a
Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob . . .
History informs of no long-lived republic which had not a senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the 19th century, Greece began to replace Rome as the
West's political and cultural model. As the British pushed to
expand democratic reforms, liberals pointed to the Athenian
experience as evidence that democracy was achievable without a
traumatic upheaval like the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The German historian Matthias Gelzer set the tone for much
subsequent Roman scholarship in 1912 with his book ``The Roman
Nobility,'' which stressed ``the hereditary nature of political
power in the great aristocratic families'' and concluded that even
if occasionally ``a new man was brought to the fore, the overall
picture did not change.''
</P>
<P>
   Rome left a much better record of its political life than did
Athens, which didn't help its image. Since historians knew more
about Rome, they could better trace the web of family connections,
special interests and bribery there.
</P>
<P>
   There has been ``general distaste for Roman politics in most
modern scholarship,'' Mary Beard, a British classicist at Cambridge
University, explained in a recent book review in The Times Literary
Supplement, published in Britain. That Rome was ``a milestone of
political freedom is only rarely trumpeted.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians like Millar are trying to reverse this perception.
After all, it was Rome, not Athens, that invented that cornerstone
of modern democracy, the secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   And even though some of Rome's popular assemblies may have had
weighted voting systems that favored the rich, they were still the
only political bodies that could pass laws and appoint governing
officials. The Senate, which was dominated by the aristocracy, had
neither of those powers.
</P>
<P>
   Millar turns traditional interpretations on their heads, using
the corruption of democracy as evidence of its existence. That
bribery was widespread demonstrates how essential popular assent
was deemed to be for the exercise of political power. As for the
reactionary, anti-democratic measures introduced by Sulla around 80
B.C., Millar said they make sense only if the supposedly
all-powerful aristocracy felt it was not getting its way. And
indeed, it had to contend with an assembly that demanded handouts
of cheap corn and land and wanted a say in the administration of
the empire.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum was the ultimate symbol of Rome's open, visible
political system. This is where leaders went to make their case and
win the support of the Roman population. Their power was so
dependent on this popular support that rival groups vied for
physical control of the places where citizens gathered, even
turning to violence to maintain their pre-eminence.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Constitution of the Roman Republic'' (Oxford University
Press, 1999), Andrew Lintott, a historian at Oxford University,
also stresses the power of the Roman assembly, which he says
``supports an interpretation of Rome as some kind of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites the Greek historian Polybius, who around 150 B.C.
attributed Rome's military success to the stability imparted by a
mixed Constitution that incorporated monarchic and aristocratic
elements as well as democratic ones.
</P>
<P>
   This Constitution was so hostile to tyranny, he adds, that even
toward the end of the republic, it was a constant restraint on
ambitious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The very scope and size of ancient Rome also makes it more
relevant to many of today's democracies. At most, the Athenian
city-state had an electorate of about 40,000 men in the middle of
the fifth century B.C., falling probably to about half that by the
end of the Peloponnesian War in 404 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Roman republic, however, there were more than
1 million Roman citizens, many of them freed slaves. Meanwhile, the
inhabitants of its quickly expanding empire were regularly granted
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Romans had a more fluid democratic concept of citizenship,
much closer to our own,'' Victor Hanson, a classicist at California
State University at Fresno, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Hallett, a classics professor at the University of Maryland
at College Park, agreed: ``Athens was an uninclusive, closed
democracy that didn't reach out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course extending citizenship didn't always means extending
power. Rome became more authoritarian as popular leaders sought
ever greater powers to tackle the problems of an expanding empire.
And to vote, Romans still had to show up personally in Rome. Thus,
anyone who lived outside the city was effectively disenfranchised.
Romans may have invented the secret ballot, but the mail-in ballot
remained something of the future.

LONDON JOURNAL: A PROPHET OF THE LEFT IS QUITTING, BUT NOT
QUIETLY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Tony Benn has roused a lot of passionate opinions since
he joined the House of Commons in 1950, but the one he most fears
now is approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the final corruption,'' he said in the basement office
of his Notting Hill house packed with the tapes and transcripts of
half a century of provocative comment.
</P>
<P>
   Papers hang from where he has stuck them to the ceiling, a
cockpit habit he picked up in wartime days as a Royal Air Force
pilot. ``It's this `dear old Tony' thing where they think you're
harmless and don't really mean what you say and they love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in a ``Dear Comrades'' letter to Labor Party
officers in his Chesterfield district, Benn announced that he would
not run for re-election. But he tried to head off notions that he
was giving up his role as prophet of Britain's left, giving robust
expression to the socialist ideology and trade union economics he
has always championed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of retiring and shall continue to work
closely with all those, outside and inside Parliament, who want to
see the Labor Party recommit itself to the causes of social
justice, democratic socialism and peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly the vexing tributes began. Alan Clark, a Conservative
member of Parliament, said: ``As a parliamentarian, he's tops. I
wouldn't mind having him as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Parris, a newspaper columnist and former Tory member of
Parliament whose district adjoined Benn's, credited him with
``rock-solid intellectual consistency, a single lifelong fight for
an unwavering set of beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   John O'Farrell, author of a Labor history, said he had inspired
generations of activists. ``If there'd been a poster of Tony Benn,
we would have had it on our walls, not Che Guevara,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Prime Minister Harold Wilson, in
whose government Benn served, said he had ``barmy ideas,'' pursued
``tomfool issues'' and represented ``a kind of aging perennial
youth _ he immatures with age.''
</P>
<P>
   Others called him a Communist, a loon, a parlor revolutionary,
an upper-class romantic, a calculating populist and ``Red Wedgie
Benn,'' a play on his socialist views and his long-discarded full
name with the unwanted aristocratic tones, Anthony Neil Wedgwood
Benn.
</P>
<P>
   The name he hated most of all was the one he had to change
British law to shed _ Viscount Stansgate, the Lord's title he
inherited on the death of his father in 1960. In a campaign that
first brought him to prominence in public life, he fought for three
years to get the legal right to turn down the hereditary title and
thereby remain in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Benn feels out of place in the Parliament he
struggled to remain a member of and in the party he began passing
out leaflets for as a 10-year-old in 1935. The boisterous Labor
assemblage of union heads, leftist ideologues and people whose
workplaces were mines, shipyards and factory floors has now become
a disciplined party of middle managers, suburban householders and
get-ahead-minded businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If guys are having a lousy deal, they want you there to
support them, and that's what I've tried to do in Parliament,''
Benn said. ``But now in Parliament, if you make a speech that
doesn't fit, then immediately all the political correspondents say
it is a coded attack on the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reporting of the argument; instead it's all this
personality rubbish and celebrities, celebrities. It's a litmus
test of loyalty to an individual, and I literally do think that
democracy is being destroyed in the nicest and politest possible
way. It has to be revitalized from the outside, and that is why
I've made the decision I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Punctuating his talk with sips of tea and draws on his pipe,
Benn warmed to the subject of whether a 74-year-old socialist was
out of date in modern Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the nature of work has changed; the term working class
is used to mean guys in overalls with dirty fingernails doing
manual work,'' he said. ``But actually the class distinction that
still matters is the difference between the earners who are 90
percent of the population and the owners who make up 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of quite well-paid people who were suddenly
thrown out in their 50's, and all of a sudden they realized that
all they had to sell was their labor, so the old idea is still
very, very relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Benn said he thought the great struggle of the 20th century had
been over the right to vote, but that victory was now being turned
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the power has gone somewhere else. It's gone to NATO, to
Brussels, it's gone to the World Trade Organization, it's gone to
Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch, to people who never get elected, and
so we're in a situation where we're far from Parliament or Congress
being there to protect people from the external powers, i.e., to
control the economy in the interest of the people,'' he said.
``Parliament is now there to control the people in the interests of
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   His goals are distinctly out of fashion in the party that Prime
Minister Tony Blair calls New Labor. While others set out in
pursuit of a ``third way,'' he sticks to his own well-trod one. He
is in favor of increasing income taxes to fund public services,
expanding the welfare state, rolling back privatization and
restoring full union rights. He is against nuclear weapons and
waging war unless it is approved by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   He is immensely proud of the entry of his 45-year-old son,
Hilary, into Parliament in a by-election in Leeds last month even
though the younger Benn proclaimed himself a committed New Labor
man. He campaigned as a ``Benn, not a Bennite,'' to which his
bemused father responded, ``Benns move left as they get older.''
</P>
<P>
   Benn's positions in the 1960s and 1970s included stints as
postmaster general, minister of technology, secretary for industry,
and secretary for energy. As a Labor Party officer, he fought for
the ``true faith'' of socialism, helping move the party to the left
in the 1970s in a fratricidal war that produced deep internal
divisions and kept it from regaining power until Blair and his
self-described ``modernizers'' moved it to the center and, not
incidentally, to electability.
</P>
<P>
   Benn was born in London in 1925, the son of William Wedgwood
Benn, a Liberal member of Parliament who later switched to Labor.
An Oxford graduate, he last month celebrated the 50th anniversary
of his marriage to Caroline Middleton, an American from Ohio. Benn
bought the park bench where he proposed from the Oxford Town
Council, and it sits in their overgrown front yard. The couple have
four children and nine grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His health is good though he wears hearing aids to correct a
condition that he quickly dismisses with an anecdote: ``It was a
very hot night in Bristol, and there was a heckler. I told him a
few times that he should run his own meeting rather than ruin ours,
and then I heard what he said. It was `Can we open a window?'''
</P>
<P>
   He dictates diary entries daily, and he estimates the word count
now tops 13 million. He has published seven volumes, and the next
one, which he goes out of his way to note will not be the last,
will cover the decade 1990-2000 and be titled ``Free at Last.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently purchased diary pages that carry him past his 100th
birthday, and he shows every confidence of being around to fill
them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final entry will be from St. Thomas' Hospital,'' he said.
``It will say, `I don't feel very well today.'''

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Michel Roux, the marketing whiz who made
Absolut vodka a household name and visual icon, has turned his wits
toward wine.
</P>
<P>
   His new Le Vin du Couer rose from Ctes de Provence comes not
only in an arresting square bottle, but also sports three distinct
labels, each a graphic variation on the theme of romance.
</P>
<P>
   Bottle one features a heart-shaped illustration of a man and
woman drinking wine outdoors at a table, with the caption Pour
lhomme et la femme, which translates simply as For man and woman.
The second and third bottles sport virtually identical artwork, but
with same-sex couples and corresponding captions Pour les hommes
and Pour les femmes.
</P>
<P>
   The wine in each bottle is the same, produced by Domaine Rabiega
in Provence. In tastings, the wine comes across as flat and
fruit-challenged compared with some of the zippier dry roses on the
market today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clearly the happy-loving-couple imagery that Roux's
company, Crillon Imports, expects to propel sales. To force the
issue, Crillon is mixing the labels randomly in every 12-bottle
case, so retailers and restaurants ordering the wine will have
little choice but to promote the multisexual message.
</P>
<P>
   Bottles of Le Vin du Couer hit shelves nationwide on July 15.
Whether the man-woman label will outsell the same-sex ones _
despite being outnumbered 2-1 _ remains to be seen. The wine
retails at $10.
</P>
<P>
   Working in the wines' favor is that the two largest
wine-consuming metropolitan areas in the United States _ New York
and San Francisco _ also have large gay populations.

HOW HEADHUNTERS LEARN TO JUKE, FEINT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ CEOs of big companies usually don't answer classified
ads. When they switch jobs, they do it discreetly: A headhunter
calls and makes an offer they can't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   But getting to the executive _ that can be tough.
</P>
<P>
   Executives almost always have secretaries screen calls. Senior
administrative assistant Carla Brooks at energy giant Enron in
Houston said that when she hears ``unique business opportunity,''
she figures it's either a stockbroker or a headhunter on the other
end.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the busy factor: Executives often don't have time
to talk to every Tom, Dick or Harry Headhunter who calls.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lucksinger, president and chief executive officer of AmCare,
a health maintenance organization, is one of those busy, in-demand
executives. It's executive secretary Lee McDonald's job to deflect
unimportant calls.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said she has worked eight years for Lucksinger and
knows who is calling and why. So, when a headhunter calls and acts
like Lucksinger's long-lost brother, her antenna shoots up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get to him,'' McDonald said. Sometimes, she takes a
message. Other times, she tells the hunter her boss isn't
interested.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CREATIVITY CAN WORK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get around the secretaries who guard the gates, headhunters
often get creative.
</P>
<P>
   David Wallace Cox, the vice president of Enron's Pulp, Packaging
and Paper Division in Houston, said that if he doesn't return his
phone calls at work fast enough, he gets calls from headhunters at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a headhunter will pretend he's a customer to try to
reach the up-and-coming executive at Enron, whose business success
was recently lauded in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so excited we may have a customer on the phone,'' said
Cox. ``Sometimes, I've even tried to sell to them,'' he said with a
laugh, mocking his questions: ``How much paper do you buy? Where do
you normally get it?''
</P>
<P>
   Long-time executive recruiter Jack Bradshaw said if he is having
trouble getting through, he'll try to find an intermediary to
broker an introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the ``target's'' friend calls and makes an
abbreviated pitch. As a favor to this friend or business colleague,
the ``target'' usually listens to the job opportunity, said
Bradshaw, managing director of the Stratford Group, a recruiter in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, Bradshaw calls the executive before 8 a.m. _ before
the secretary arrives _ or after 5:30. Executives often pick up
their own phones when no one else is around to answer them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives who say they do not want to field headhunters'
calls will call back, Bradshaw said. They may not be looking for a
job now, but they figure ``if I'm on some recruiter's list, I
should stay on the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters also are a great source for obtaining information
about the competition. Employment lawyer Richard Brann said he can
find out which firms are beefing up their employment law section.
</P>
<P>
   Brann said he gets a fair number of legal-industry headhunters
calling about a ``great opportunity.'' If they're calling him at
Baker &AMP; Botts in Houston, he figures they're also calling other
lawyers at the firm. So he wants to know what kind of offers and
salaries are circulating.
</P>
<P>
   Brann, who makes his living selling legal advice, said he can't
afford not to return any call _ even calls from stock brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I think it's a headhunter and it turns out to be a
client, and other times I think it's a potential client and it
turns out to be headhunter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TOP-SECRET CONQUEST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Often, executives will recognize the search firm, which
increases the chance they'll take the call, said John Griffin,
partner in charge of global energy, chemicals and utilities for
Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, a search firm in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   That increase in visibility is in part because headhunters have
been in the news lately for identifying candidates for high-level
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Headhunters who fill high-profile positions sometimes use their
success to seek publicity that will help them do more business.
This week, the publicist for the headhunter who found
Hewlett-Packard Co.'s new CEO asked if the Houston Chronicle wanted
to interview the recruiter.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters can sometimes face what appear to be daunting
challenges. Griffin said he was trying to find the perfect
candidate for a high-tech manufacturing company. He heard about
someone who worked for a defense company. The man's phone number
was literally top secret.
</P>
<P>
   After Griffin had had three long phone conversations with a
secretary, she finally divulged the phone number. The vice
president took the job. Griffin sent the secretary a box of Godiva
chocolates.

 &HT;    Beanie-baby buyers come in every size and shape
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I caught myself making up Beanie-Baby names
for the people waiting outside the line at the Rainforest Cafe.
This wasn't a great deal of fun, but I had already lost all my
change trying to toss it inside the mechanical crocodile's mouth. I
had to do something.
</P>
<P>
   I was bored beyond all hope.
</P>
<P>
   But so was everyone else and, lucky for me, I had only been
outside the cafe _ I wasn't officially in line _ for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-aged guy I named ``Jelly'' (His shirt won't
cover/those rolls of his belly/that's why we all/just call him
Jelly) said aloud to no one in particular that he had been waiting
in line to buy Beanie Babies at the Rainforest Cafe for 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my watch. It was 10 a.m. Jelly had spent the night
at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Or, rather, outside the mall. The mall police kick all the
Beanie afficianados out at 9 p.m. and they faithfully line up
outside. At 8 a.m. the mall police let them back in again and they
line up in the same order they slept.
</P>
<P>
   I can imagine a few products that would lead me to spend the
night on concrete outside a mall if I thought I had a reasonable
chance at getting one; Super Bowl tickets, perhaps, or a World
Series game in which the Texas Rangers were playing.
</P>
<P>
   But put this into perspective. This is not a once in a lifetime
event for the Beanie people. They do this every week. Each Monday
night they trudge to Grapevine Mills Mall and begin lining up like
beggars before the feast.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the most important part: No one in the line has the
slightest idea until 10 minutes before the store opens what will be
offered for sale. That is like waiting in line for a World Series
ticket and finding out that the only thing being sold were tickets
to a Don Ho concert.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters, I saw:
</P>
<P>
   _ Grouch: She's been up all night/away from her couch/Don't mess
with that woman/the one they call Grouch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frazzle: She can't mind her kids/She can't have the
hassle/they're shoplifting again/but don't bother Frazzle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cheater: She'll cut in line so quick/you really can't beat
her/you'll need a big purse/to knock away Cheater.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speedy: Watch Speedy run!/away he will zoom!/That dang Beanie
line/has no men's restroom.
</P>
<P>
   It is a misconception that all those buying Beanie Babies are
women, indeed, there were, like Jelly, several men in this Beanie
Baby line, though he had been the only one to pull an all-nighter.
</P>
<P>
   (Lest anyone begin to eye me suspiciously, let me hasten to say
I was watching this line because my wife had joined it that
morning. Honest.)
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that men in Beanie Baby lines have a completely
different reason for being there than most women, or at least they
pretend to have a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   The women in this line obviously liked Beanie Babies because of
the ``cute'' factor. The men, on the other hand, postured
themselves as ``investors,'' a sort Merrill, Lynch, Spangle of
Beanie Street.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK by me to spend the night waiting to buy something cute,
but to spend your time trying to buy a stuffed animal you believe
will make you rich is bit much. Perhaps these guys think they need
to horde Beanie Babies before the Y2K crisis so if the worst
happens they can trade a Jabber for a gallon of water.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Beanie Baby Brotherhood waited in line patiently
until about 9:45 a.m. when employees of the Rainforest Cafe pass
out the list of what will be sold. Why this cannot be posted the
night before so people do not have to sleep all night on the
concrete is beyond me. It must be part of building the Beanie Baby
``mystique.''
</P>
<P>
   When the list was passed out, Jelly became highly agitated. He
had been sure a Spangle would be for sale and it was nowhere on the
list. Immediately, he suspected an international conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has to be going on,'' he said, narrowing his eyes.
``When a big outfit like this can't lay its hands on a Spangle,
something is a little fishy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishy? You must be talking about Neon the sea horse. Sorry,
Jelly, but you're just going to have to get back in line.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some Rhode Island state agency stuck a car counter outside my
driveway, on the dogleg of Bellevue Avenue, just past Doris Duke's
mansion, Rough Point, the last in a long line of the alternately
grim and lovely mansions on Newport's Gilded Age strip.
</P>
<P>
   Between noon on a Saturday and noon on Sunday, 8,000 cars choked
past; by 7:45 Monday morning, the counter had ticked off 3,000
more. But these are not the most telling details about summer in a
city through which more than 600,000 tourists pass between May and
October, eager for a look at the excesses of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   The real Newport, still a little fusty, still sort of stylish,
chugs along, and it looks something like this.
</P>
<P>
   NAUGHTY NIGHTS IN THE KITCHEN At 10 a.m. on a foggy Friday in
July, Brigit Nihan, a Dutch designer, loitered on her couch wearing
not much more than her long blond hair and a chenille bathrobe. Ms.
Nihan, 38, was waiting for customers for her first trunk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way this is a success story, but in another way it's a
disaster story,'' Ms. Nihan said, flicking off her robe to model
one of her designs, a denim wrap skirt edged in a 1970s-era
psychedelic print and a white T-shirt. ``I was just planning to
make clothes for girlfriends, for (italics)housewives,''(end
italics) she said. ``I wanted a new kitchen. I thought we could
make some money. It was not my intention to be a fashion designer.
I'm from Newport, so what do I know?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nihan's living room, in a modest house just above Newport
Harbor, was strewn with her ``housewife'' clothes: wrap skirts and
dresses in vintage fabrics like old quilting prints, bandana prints
and tiny paisley prints, many edged with rickrack or ruffles. Ms.
Nihan grew up in Amsterdam and trained as an architect. She moved
to New York in the late '80s and to Newport a few years ago with
her husband and two small boys.
</P>
<P>
   She has been making clothes only since February. She sold them
in the spring under the name Brigit at Barneys, Henri Bendel, Fred
Siegal and Steven Alan, as well as at Japanese department stores,
an unusually successful Seventh Avenue foray. Orders from those
stores have weighed heavily upon her slight shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these horrible things, like you have to be ready for
spring 2000 by Sept. 1,'' she said. ``Are they kidding?'' She has
decided to skip a fall collection to make the spring deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Perking up, Ms. Nihan described her line. The ``diner skirt,''
in a gray men's shirting fabric trimmed with white rickrack, is a
``naughty little waitress skirt.'' She calls a pink baby-corduroy
dress with enormous white buttons up the back and big pockets in
front ``the nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   Off came the denim wrap skirt. ``You see, you are like a little
nurse in this dress,'' Ms. Nihan said, twisting to show off the
buttons. ``It's very sexy to be a nurse. And this, this is my best
seller,'' she said, flinging off ``the nurse'' and donning a pale
yellow sleeveless wrap dress printed with sprigs of flowers and
edged in a marvelous ruffle. ``Look how sexy, it opens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nihan said she didn't really think Newport was a bawdy town.
``Or maybe I'm not supposed to see it that way because I'm a
housewife,'' she said. ``Anyway, I was thinking that I wanted to
make things that were very casual and very frumpy. They turn out to
be sexy because they just sort of fall open.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, her designs have that sort of craftsy, handmade,
outsider arty look that appeals to urban sensibilities, even as
they play a nice ironic counterpoint to the Lilly Pulitzer dresses
and skirts still worn by quite a few Newport women, many of whom
are, in fact, housewives.
</P>
<P>
   PASHMINAS AND ROSES At 7 p.m. that same evening, many of the 500
or so guests at a preview party for the annual Newport Flower Show,
a benefit for the properties of the Preservation Society of Newport
County, were bottlenecked in a booth full of pashmina shawls. They
had filed dutifully through Rosecliff, the turn-of-the-century
Stanford White mansion, where the show is held each year, past the
heart-shape staircase and into the white and gold ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There, on display, were the winners of flower-arranging
competitions in categories like ``R.S.V.P.'' (``a monochromatic
arrangement in tints, tones and shades of pink'') and `Dinner at
8,'' (``a dinner table for six guests inspired by Mary McFadden
evening gowns'').
</P>
<P>
   They spilled out onto the marble veranda and down to the
perfect, stepped turf where 88 exhibitors of things like stone
garden figurines and bronze fountain sculptures formed a horseshoe
of tented booths.
</P>
<P>
   The pashminas came in as many colors as Gatsby's shirts. Some
had embellishments like embroidery and beads, prompting much
stroking, patting and sighing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most I've ever sold to one person at one time was 11,''
said Susan Gubelmann, whose booth it was and who has been selling
pashminas at cocktail parties and trunk shows since April. ``If I
pay attention, I think this could be really big. A little chatting,
a little selling, cha-cha-cha. Just imagine, I've got pashminas for
babies, the precious little darlings!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gubelmann, who was also the marketplace coordinator of the
event, did not have a pashmina on, but she was wearing a terrific
ostrich feather hat. It was made for her that afternoon by Lisa
Stubbs, whose company is called Lilo and who made many of the hats
sailing past that evening, like little galleons of straw, ribbon
and feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Target, one of the sponsors of the show, had a booth, too. It
was giving away little pots of tiny red rosebushes. Many people
took two. What with all the big hats and the little roses, and if
you squinted a bit and tried to forget about the fetching
periwinkle pashmina you'd just lost to a woman in an ankle-length
pink Lilly Pulitzer, it looked as if beautifully costumed extras
had been deployed about the place by the set designer of ``An Ideal
Husband,'' everyone twirling and bobbing in perfect period style.
</P>
<P>
   SKATERS AND SURFERS Duffs is a company that makes skateboard
shoes, and on a warm Friday night, the company was scheduled for an
exhibition of expert skaters wearing Duffs goods at Skater Island,
a year-old skate park in Middletown, Newport's less glamorous
neighbor on Aquidneck Island.
</P>
<P>
   At 7, he Duff skaters were an hour late, but the 20-odd kids
rattling around in the cavernous arena (a plywood simulacrum of a
city park and an empty pool, with skater temptations like a 12-foot
``vert'' ramp) didn't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   Tayler, 10, said gruffly that she wasn't there for Duffs. She
was there because she's at Skater Island most nights. A year
membership here is $50. Four hours of skating costs $5 for members,
and $10 for nonmembers, but a lot of the kids skate free because
Sid Abbruzzi, 48, a surfer who owns the place with two partners,
runs outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
   AC-DC played loud and scratchy. Tayler clambered up onto the
plywood catwalk and dropped down into the ``pool,'' her tiny body
obscured by her dinged-up white helmet and huge kneepads as she
plummeted eight feet into the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:30, moms began arriving, hauling off the little ones, and
older kids like Ashley, 18, showed up. Ashley said that most of the
older skaters were surfers, too, a poignant identity in a state
with not much surf. ``It's the whole Ocean State thing,'' she said.
``You know, Rhode Island, the ocean, you're a surfer.'' She trailed
off, and went to tackle the street course.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be surfers can get daily surf reports from Water
Brothers, Abbruzzi's surf shop on Memorial Boulevard in Newport.
Here's an excerpt from last week. ``Surfing is real flat, forget
about it today. (italics)The waves are flat.(end italics) Later.''

REMEMBERING JOHN KENNDY JR: INTIMATIONS AND REGRETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 25)  
(also see KENNEDY-BESSETTE-REMEMBER) 
 (bl)  
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I never knew what to say to John Kennedy Jr. We were
at Brown together and he lived off campus with some of my friends,
but I didn't know him personally. I can't say if it was respect for
his privacy or my own pride that kept me from pushing our social
connections to make him aware of me in the years that followed. I
knew that he would have been gracious if I had introduced myself at
a party, but I also knew that he had more than enough people to
talk to wherever he went.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the nicest thing you can do for someone is leave him
alone, and so I was biding my time for the last 15 years until we
had reason to talk.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, four hours before he left for his cousin Rory's
wedding in Hyannis Port, he called. ``Hi, it's John from George,''
he said. (I love the way he'd go around introducing himself in
public by saying, ``Hi, I'm John _ it was sort of like, ``Hi, I'm
Elvis.'')
</P>
<P>
   He was calling to thank me for a cover story I'd written for the
July issue of his magazine, George, and was pleased to hear that
I'd had a good experience with members of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of my first real moment with him, I went into
an unsolicited little pep talk about how George could be improved.
</P>
<P>
   I was probably speaking out of turn (a less generous editor in
chief would know better than to call a freelance writer on a Friday
afternoon) but he deflected my criticism handily and ended on a
cheerful note. ``I just wanted to thank you for doing a really
great job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the news broke the next day, my sadness contained a
selfish taint. After so many years of waiting to distinguish myself
in his eyes, our relationship had come and gone in an instant. That
evening, a producer from CNN called. Before she had a chance to try
to elicit names and phone numbers of people who actually knew
Kennedy well, I said that I'd gotten a call from him myself just a
few hours before he got in his plane. Within minutes, another CNN
producer called.
</P>
<P>
   When he offered condolences, I told him it was not a personal
loss and that Kennedy wasn't a friend, only that he had impressed
me by calling, and if that was the sort of comment needed for the
tribute that CNN was rushing to put together for Sunday night, then
I'd be happy to testify. The producer wanted to book me for 8 the
next morning. Was that too early? Of course not. I should have felt
queasy. But I was thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been said about the media's ghoulish feeding on tragedy
as news. Fashion and media people had their air time with Versace
and Diana. Columbine high school students had their moment. Now, I
was having mine. It was oddly empowering to know that CNN was
driving out to East Hampton to speak with me, even if I knew
Kennedy only in the most transitory way. For years, I'd known that
his  &UR; real &LR;  friends took care not to speak to the press about him,
and that his staff at George was not commenting, either.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, my living room was being wired for the
interview. Couches were moved. Lights were set up. The producer
prepared notes and stopped me from talking before the cameras
rolled. ``If you have something to say,'' he told me, ``it always
comes out better the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   I made it clear, once again, that I was speaking only as a
freelance writer for George, nothing more. But when the cameras
rolled, the producer started asking me about Kennedy's days at
Brown and what his mother thought of his acting aspirations there.
I had to stop and say that I wasn't comfortable speaking about
Kennedy's personal life. Of course, when I turned on the television
that night, I was presented as someone who knew him. For anybody
who really knew him I must have sounded like an opportunistic
imposter.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the calls have started coming in: from people who
knew that I knew some people who knew him. From people who knew him
only slightly better than I did, like the friend who dreamed that
Kennedy came to her home to comfort her about his death, or the
friend who was in Hyannis Port for Rory Kennedy's wedding. Another
friend reported that an editor she knew was having a beer with
Kennedy and staff members in his office after he had made his call
to me. ``Even if you weren't the last person he talked to at
work,'' she said, ``maybe you were the last person he  &UR; called &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Now, having seen all the coverage, it strikes me that there are
many levels of knowing a person. The strangers laying flowers in
front of a door in Tribeca and speaking to reporters with tears in
their eyes aren't overcome just because they need to feel a part of
something. They're struggling to find themselves in him, to touch
something to make him their own. It's the same with the people he
knew well or, like me, hardly at all. Everybody wanted to touch
him. They still do.
</P>
<P>
   After CNN finished with me, but before the interview was
broadcast, I called a close friend who had known Kennedy since high
school. She was finding it strange to be flooded with phone calls
all weekend from people she didn't know very well, all wanting to
check in with her and her husband about the tragedy. Quietly, she
told me that whenever she and her husband would go out with John,
he'd immediately lift their son up onto his shoulders and carry him
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good guy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I hope she didn't catch me on CNN. &QL;

MOUSE LEADS WAY INTO COMPUTER LEARNING ADVENTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: FYI, in last graf, (at) stands in for the symbol.) 
(yn) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mia Mouse is a mouse who follows the computer's mouse. Mia's the
star of Mia: The Search for Grandma's Remedy (Windows, Macintosh;
about $25-$30), a two-CD-ROM game for children ages 5 and older.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first offering from a Canadian company, Kutoka
Interactive of Montreal. The company plans three other
learning-based titles for children with each one focusing on a
separate subject: science, arts and math.
</P>
<P>
   Grandma's Remedy places emphasis on literacy skills. It's a cute
program, with an ailing Grandma mouse in a sardine-can bed and a
tea-bag pillow.
</P>
<P>
   While this is Kutoka's first release, it isn't the company's
first attempt with children's educational programs. The 4-year-old
company was a developer of programs with Compaq, Fischer Price,
Corel Corp., and other companies that publish software for the
children's market, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Mouse's grandmother needs medicine. In Mouseland, sparklies
are used for currency, and Romaine Rat has swiped Grandma's stash.
It's up to Mia to amass enough sparklies to purchase Grandma's
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Mouse must cover the Victorian house from attic to
garden. Along the way, she'll meet a dozen or more characters _
spiders, birds and frogs _ as well as inanimate objects brought to
life.
</P>
<P>
   The animation is well done. Richard Vincent, president of Kutoka
Interactive, said the company's committed to using the best video
technology, and employed a method with Mia to give players
real-time control. There are some nice features: Mia's eyes, for
instance, will follow the movements of your mouse, and Mia can go
anywhere on the computer screen the cursor goes. If the child needs
help, successive clicks on Mia's head provides more and more
detail.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine activities and four levels of difficulty, so as
the child improves or grows older, the game can be revisited. The
activities help develop vocabulary, word recognition and thinking
skills.
</P>
<P>
   The program was named the ``Best of Retail Vision 1999'' earlier
this year in San Francisco, competing against titles from LucasArt,
Hasbro and other better-known producers. It also has gained
finalist status in several software award competitions outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>

United States and Canada: 1-877-858-8652, or visit the company's

NAVY AND MARINE CORPS FIGHT TO KEEP BOMBING RANGE IN PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy and Marine Corps took a hardline Friday in
a dispute with Puerto Rico over a military bombing range, raising
the likelihood that the White House will be called upon to settle a
disagreement that has repercussions for the New York Senate
campaign of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Pentagon panel appointed at the request of
President Clinton to resolve the dispute expressed frustration with
the armed services' unyielding approach to a controversy centered
on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Marine Corps want to resume simulated combat
operations on the 22-mile-long island that were halted in April
following a bombing mishap in which a Marine F/A-18 pilot
mistakenly dropped two 500-pound bombs on an observation post,
killing a Puerto Rican civilian Navy employee and injuring four
others.
</P>
<P>
   The accident has ignited a political firestorm across Puerto
Rico, prompting the political leaders of the island's 3.8 million
U.S. citizens to demand permanent cessation of bombing and
withdrawal of the Navy from the island of 9,300.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen protesters picketed outside the office building where
the Pentagon panel met Friday, demanding Navy withdrawal. Dozens of
Puerto Rican protesters continue to occupy the 899-acre target zone
on Vieques formerly used for aerial bombardment, naval gunfire and
Marine mortar and artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials anticipate the stalemate
between the armed services and Puerto Rico's political leaders will
reach the White House in late summer, requiring the president to
make a decision that could affect whether Mrs. Clinton's burgeoning
Senate campaign gains political support from New York's two million
Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Vice Adm. William J. Fallon and Marine Lt. Gen. Peter Pace
insisted in testimony before the four-member Pentagon panel that
live fire training on Vieques remains essential to prepare
aviators, sailors and Marines for possible combat overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a game,'' Fallon declared. ``We're talking about
people's lives here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon, the Atlantic fleet commander responsible for preparing
forces for deployment, warned that live fire training must resume
on Vieques by September or the combat armada centered around the
aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower will deploy to Europe and
the Middle East later this year with ``serious deficiencies'' that
could jeopardize performance in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Pace said military leaders have ``a moral obligation'' to
provide combat forces with the best, most realistic live-fire
training available before sending troops into harms' way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe that to them,'' said Pace, commander of 92,000 Marines
in the Atlantic and Europe. ``Without Vieques, the forces would not
be trained as well as they could be before we put them at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But members of the Pentagon panel complained that the two armed
services were ignoring the need for compromise to accommodate
changing political realities in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Navy Vice Adm. Diego Hernandez, a Puerto Rico-born
member of the Pentagon panel who formerly served as commander of
the U.S. Caribbean fleet, challenged the Navy and Marine Corps to
help find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a problem is insoluble, you have to redefine the
problem,'' said Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Marine Corps Gen. Richard Neal, a member of the panel,
decried the armed forces' ``lack of sensitivity'' toward the
residents of Vieques and urged the Navy and Marine Corps to talk
directly to Puerto Rico's leaders and residents of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon and Pace said they visited Vieques to prepare for their
report but did not meet with local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a hand-in-glove relationship,'' Neal said.
``The implication of the testimony I am hearing today is, `That is
not my job,' when in fact I see it as a key part of your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., a member of the panel who
served as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the
armed services are failing to deal with fast-changing political
circumstances in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal in facts, not in sentiments,'' replied Fallon, the
senior Navy officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admiral, let me tell you something _ public perceptions are
facts. Public attitudes are facts,'' Hamilton replied curtly.
</P>
<P>
   Alcides Ortiz, executive director and general counsel of the
Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration which handles the
island's dealings with the federal government, said the armed
services and Puerto Rico's political leaders are not discussing a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Rico's political leaders, led by Gov. Pedro Rossello,
are already meeting with White House officials to press their case
for Navy withdrawal. The governor met Monday at the White House
with the president's deputy chief of staff, Maria Echaveste. The
governor, who heads Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign
in Puerto Rico, also met with Tony Coelho, head of Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, the governor's top representative in Washington, D.C.,
said Rossello had not made any requests for specific action on
Vieques to either the president or the first lady other than asking
Clinton, as commander-in-chief, to review the balance of military
requirements and local political sentiment.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pace, the senior Marine officer, appealed for the fact-finding
panel to help the armed services and Puerto Rico find a compromise
to the stubborn impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family event _ we're trying to sit around the dinner
table trying to figure how we fix this thing,'' Pace said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon panel, lacking even the outlines of a compromise,
ordered two more days of hearings _ a development that will delay
the report to the White House beyond the initial Aug. 2 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The panel left late Friday to visit Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Panel Chairman Frank Rush, a senior Defense Department official,
said the panel would receive recommendations from the Navy on steps
for greater economic development on Vieques and the turnover of
some of the Navy's 22,000 acres to Puerto Rico _ gestures that may
help ease the political standoff.

IS THERE ROOM FOR FASHION AT THE PARIS HAUTE COUTURE SHOWS?

 (HLW)  
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ What with a white-smocked Andre Leon Talley squiring
around a crew from ABC, another from the BBC following Anna
Wintour, and Puff Daddy simultaneously promoting his new record and
posing for a fashion shoot by Annie Leibovitz, all at the same
late-night party, the autumn haute couture shows certainly were the
media equivalent of shooting fish in a barrel. And this should have
pleased no one more than Bernard Arnault.
</P>
<P>
   It was Arnault, the chairman of the French luxury conglomerate
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, who put John Galliano at Dior and
Alexander McQueen at Givenchy, thus bringing to a couple of aging
fashion houses, and to haute couture, a new sense of excitement.
You don't have to dwell on how important this was, or how much
money LVMH started pouring into couture. But nobody expects to make
money selling $30,000 dresses. That's not what haute couture exists
for. It's to generate publicity for all the other products,
perfume, for instance, that a company sells. In effect, that's why
Galliano and McQueen are there.
</P>
<P>
   But after Galliano's Dior show on the night of July 19, one
would have to wonder whether Arnault had made a deal with the
devil. The show was at Versailles, in the Orangerie. ``I hear the
collection is beautiful,'' an American client said before she sat
down on a plastic seat cushion filled with water. Obviously, a lot
of people were anticipating something in keeping with Louis XIV,
not a 450-foot runway padded in white plastic, with French security
guards in black wraparound sunglasses, like the ones Keanu Reeves
wears in ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the show began. The first models _ well, you could see
right away that the inspiration was the futuristic guerrilla look
of ``The Matrix.'' A lot of black leather cut at weird angles, with
chain-link or lace tunics, cartridge belts and lots of buckles. By
the time some Day-Glo outfits appeared, people were looking
mortified. What was all this? Then out came long coat dresses in
loden and cream wool, some riding pinks and leather outfits in a
hackneyed English hunting theme, all worn with elaborately
feathered hats sporting foxtails, embalmed and stuffed birds and
one boar's head grinning on a bed of ivy.
</P>
<P>
   It was ludicrous. Even if there was something believably modern
here, the sort of world Galliano was envisioning hardly needs haute
couture. It all seemed perversely designed to offend. Even harder
to fathom is the publicity value to Dior, and LVMH, of a collection
that is at right angles with the image of the house.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, Kal Ruttenstein, fashion director of
Bloomingdale's, said, ``I think Arnault is smart enough to know
that if you give a designer like Galliano access to creativity,
then it makes Paris seem an exciting place, and that's good for
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the so-called new couture is more preoccupied
with image than with product. For instance, Viktor Horsting and
Rolf Snoeren, the Dutch designers, concede that they haven't sold a
single garment since they started showing in Paris a couple of
years ago. Yet, they continue to build their name. What is more,
their show on July 20 was the most brilliant of the week.
</P>
<P>
   They did the whole presentation with one model, Maggie Rizer,
standing on a revolving turntable in the middle of a square stage.
Her first outfit was a mini-dress of natural jute and silk. After
she revolved a few times, moving only her eyelids, the designers
put a jute dress embroidered with lace and Swarovski crystals over
the mini. She revolved, and they brought out another dress. They
kept adding layers, in floral silk taffeta or jute with embroidery.
It was like one of those Chia Pet commercials. Watch Maggie grow.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it was mesmerizing, and the crowd was with it the whole
way. By the ninth layer, a huge jute cape, Maggie's head appeared
to have shrunk to the size of a walnut as the designers achieved
their signature silhouette of massively over-scale shoulders. Then
Maggie clasped her hands, covered with tiny strands of colored
crystals, and revolved as the crowd roared. She looked like the
Infant of Prague or an angel.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Snoeren said: ``Making this collection was very
special for us. It was like a celebration of fashion.'' Isabella
Blow, the London stylist, who helped raise money for the
presentation, said it cost about $60,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Most people, if they understand fashion, go for the established
houses, where the styles aren't so radical. After the Ungaro show,
the couture salon was packed with clients trying on dresses and
putting samples on reserve. The next morning, Michelle Herbert, a
New Yorker, came breezing in with her husband, Larry Herbert, whose
Pantone Inc. develops color systems for the fashion and publishing
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Slipping into a red lace dress, Mrs. Herbert assessed the week:
``I thought this was one of Ungaro's best collections. Part of
Givenchy was good. I mean, Alexander does great work. Dior was a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to clients accustomed to personal chefs and bodyguards,
there's a thrill to being looked after by a couture house. Big
customers are sent flowers and invited to private dinners. ``They
make me feel like the enfante cherie, the beloved child,'' said
France Goldman, a French-speaking client from Florida, who had
picked out a few things from Ungaro and Yves Saint Laurent. She
added: ``There's nothing like a Saint Laurent fitting. You have
seven or eight people around you, one to fit the sleeves, one for
the blouse. And when you wear the suit, you think: `Wow! You could
walk into any room and look perfect.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Saint Laurent is there for. His show on July 21
started off predictably. There were dark jersey dresses, smartly
tucked and belted, some suede and tweedy gray suits with blanket
stitching and bright paisley blouses, and pretty color mixes, like
a sage suede skirt with a lilac boucle jacket.
</P>
<P>
   But the show gathered steam when a model fanned open her pink
taffeta evening coat, with its fizz of marabou feathers, to display
an exquisitely draped gown in aquamarine satin. Out came
embroidered peasant blouses and a sleeveless evening top quivering
with white feathers over a long black skirt, with more feathers
above the elbows of long black gloves. It was vintage Saint
Laurent, but in a manic couture season, it was an even, even show.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar de la Renta's show for Balmain didn't quite blow up one's
skirt, as they say, but there were some deliciously high moments,
as when a model came out in a floor-length mink caftan, and another
emerged in a poncho of sheared saffron-dyed mink over tweedy gray
pants. More down-to-earth day looks included a double-faced wool
coat and dress of pale pink and pistachio, and a navy wool dress
with subtle embroidery and a fizz of trim around the hem.
</P>
<P>
   With Balmain among the top sellers of couture, and familiar
faces like Nan Kempner, Princess Firyal of Jordan and Jayne
Wrightsman (in white-rimmed sunglasses) in the front row, de la
Renta has reason to play the field at night. But his many evening
looks, from simple jewel-tone sheaths to fancy ball gowns and a
pretty navy gown with sprinkles of feathers and roses tucked under
folds of fabric, would have been better served without so many
competing social agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modernist'' is not a word that most people use to describe
Christian Lacroix, but that is what he is. His collection on July
20 was about abstraction and intense color, often with handpainted
flourishes, yet done in the craft of couture. That might be a pale
gray column streaked with intersecting bars of black and lime, with
a snug jacket knitted eccentrically with spangles. Or an A-line
gown with wide diagonal stripes of lime, cream and black suspended
from a slender yoke of black crushed velvet.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the shapes were simple, Lacroix's use of them
as canvases, adorning a rose-pink shift, for instance, with a
patchwork of images and bronze brush strokes, made them visually
complex. It was only when he piled on a bow or got carried away
with geometry that his fine point was lost.
</P>
<P>
   All week long, Talley, editor at large of Vogue, has been riding
shotgun for the producers of a special about the collections (to be
shown on July 29 at 9 p.m. on ABC), leading them through the high
country. The other day, he was at Chanel, interviewing Karl
Lagerfeld in his studio.
</P>
<P>
   A model came in wearing a rose-pink taffeta skirt with a net top
encrusted with gold beads. She twirled, and Lagerfeld said, ``It's
like a parachute, no?'' With that, he started drawing the design on
a piece of paper, talking all the while.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Talley shouted to an assistant, ``I need a mike!''
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld, oblivious, continued to talk about the modernness of
the full skirt. ``You don't have an old ball gown situation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, July 20, Lagerfeld presented the last Chanel haute
couture show of the 1990s. It was something. The first model came
out in a black boucle coat with a white collar of knitted silk
balls fluffing up like a ruff, and like one in a famous portrait of
Coco Chanel. From there, Lagerfeld marched toward the 21st century.
Here was a collection that bridged the gap between old and new, the
only one of the week that offered proportions and shapes that might
be meaningful to women.
</P>
<P>
   Suits told the story. They were close to the body, in solid
shades of wine, cream and heather, with short skirts and jackets
with hidden zippers in the shoulders, so that they went on like
tunics but in essence were jackets. The models looked comfortable
as they pushed their hands into the pockets. Lightness was also
suggested by shifts made from laying rectangles of crepe on tulle
for a grid effect.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld replayed his knitted silk balls on a navy evening
jacket, worn with a long skirt of navy satin. Some of the silk
faille dresses, in colors like ruby and lavender, with which he
closed the show, looked a little too voluminous, but they were
popular the next day with clients. And they certainly didn't add up
to an old ball gown situation.

GASOLINE PRICES UP MODERATELY THIS SUMMER, WITH FURTHER INCREASES
POSSIBLE

<P>
   Gasoline prices across the United States have risen moderately
in the summer driving season, continuing an upward trend that began
earlier in the year as oil-producing nations cut back supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Further increases may be in store, those who follow the industry
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices at the pump could go up as much as 10 cents a gallon,''
said Frederick Leuffer, an oil analyst with Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Retail prices rose by 2.6 cents last week to a national average
of $1.17 a gallon for regular, according to an Energy Department
survey of 800 gas stations, the highest level since November of
1997. Gasoline prices have risen 33 percent since last February
when they reached a low for the year of 87.8 cents a gallon. On an
inflation-adjusted basis, that was the lowest price for gas since
the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in California have risen higher, to an average of $1.46 a
gallon for regular.
</P>
<P>
   They jumped by 8.2 cents last week following a July 9 explosion
at a Chevron Corp. refinery near Oakland. Prices were highest in
the northern part of the state where a series of refinery problems
have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Premium gasoline is selling for close to $2.00 a gallon at some
Northern California stations.
</P>
<P>
   With higher prices, refiners like Amerada Hess Corp. have sent
extra supplies of gasoline in tankers which could ease the upward
spiral. Spot prices in the futures market have already fallen this
week for California gasoline. Retail prices have been volatile all
year, approaching an average of $1.60 in the spring, before
falling, and then rising again in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To help ease the shortages, the California Air Resources Board
last week granted Chevron a temporary variance to allow the company
to sell up to 147 million gallons of higher sulphur gasoline that
does not meet the state's air quality standards.In the past, the
regulations have led to prices that have generally been about to 10
cents a gallon higher than in the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies have also been tight because demand has been higher
than last year because of the strong economy, with many people
driving sport utility vehicles that have lower gas mileage. In
California, gasoline consumption has been running about two percent
above last year's levels. At this point, however, the rising cost
of crude oil appears to be the primary reason whys refiners have
raised gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crude oil prices turned out to be a lot higher than anybody
thought they were going to be,'' said John Lichtblau, the chairman
of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an oil industry
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Leuffer of Bear Stearns predicts that crude oil prices could go
as high as $27 a barrel. The price was only $11 a barrel for the
benchmark West Texas Intermediate just four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Supply cutbacks agreed to in March by the OPEC nations and other
non-OPEC producers such as Mexico are the main factor behind rising
crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Major oil producers agreed to reduce production by about 1.72
million barrels, or 8 percent. The compliance rate among OPEC
producers has been about 90 percent, according to Bear Stearns, a
higher figure than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks came at a time when demand had also been more
robust than had been forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The International Energy Agency, which had forecast in May that
world demand for crude oil would rise by 1.5 percent, recently
increased that estimate to two percent due to signs of recovery in
some of the Asian economies such as Japan.
</P>
<P>
   This has brought down inventories of crude oil throughout the
world. Oil companies have cut back on drilling and exploration,
which has led to much slower development of new supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Leuffer, for example projects that non-OPEC production will be
down by about 400,000 barrels a day and that most oil companies
will not be rushing to increase spending on exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good news for the consumer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lattif, the president of Gateway, a small auto parts
company, has watched the price of regular gasoline surge from about
$1.19 a gallon to $1.27 this week at some local stations in
Danbury, Conn. Lattif drives a Ford Explorer, a sport utility
vehicle, and his company has 16 delivery vans.
</P>
<P>
   He has decided to switch his firm's fuel purchases to gas
stations with lower prices at the pump, rather than sticking with a
company that offered refunds when gasoline purchases reach certain
levels. At current prices, he calculates the change could save as
much as $2,000 a year.

MEXICO TO REVIEW AUTOPSY REPORTS OF JOURNALIST'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Raul Valencia Valencia is CQ.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A new forensic specialist has been appointed to
review two differing reports on the death of an American journalist
who was slain while hiking in a mountainous region of western
Mexico last year, a prosecutor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, David Magdaleno Rodriguez, said in a telephone
interview that he expects the presiding judge to decide in
September the fate of two Huichol Indians who have confessed to
killing Philip True, the Mexico City bureau chief of the San
Antonio Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   Magdaleno said he would interview the wives of the two suspects
next month at their remote ranch in the Jalisco state municipality
of Mesquitic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is delayed because both the defense and the
prosecution have to travel to distant places to get testimonies and
evidence,'' said Magdaleno, speaking from the rural town of
Colotlan where the two men are jailed. ``But we are hoping to have
a resolution by the end of September.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Chivarra de la Cruz, 28, and his brother-in-law Miguel
Hernandez de la Cruz, 24, were arrested in December after signing a
confession that they had hit and strangled True, 50, because he had
offended them by taking their photographs.
</P>
<P>
   An experienced hiker, True was killed while on a trek through
the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains while researching the Huichol
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been marked by contrasting autopsy reports and the
varying accounts of the two suspects. Magdaleno said a forensic
investigator, Raul Valencia Valencia has been appointed to review
the autopsies to write a concluding report.
</P>
<P>
   The first autopsy was conducted in December by Jalisco state
coroner Mario Rivas Souza, who determined True's death was a
homicide by strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   A second autopsy was performed by examiners with the federal
attorney general's office concluded that True died from edema, an
excessive accumulation of fluids in the lungs, and from a blow to
the head.
</P>
<P>
   The second autopsy also said True, a moderate drinker, had high
alcohol levels in his blood. It did not indicate that a body often
produces alcohol after death.
</P>
<P>
   True's body was found Dec. 16 in a makeshift grave in a steep
canyon after a week-long search involving the Mexican military,
friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Since confessing to the killing, the two men have tried to
change their stories at least twice and have had different defense
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   After they were jailed, they told investigators they killed
True, saying he appeared to be drunk and entered their house
without permission, threatening to rape the wife of one of the men.
</P>
<P>
   They later said they didn't kill True and that they only saw him
walking past their ranch one early morning in December. Chivarra
said they confessed to the killing only because the authorities had
tortured them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw the gringo before in my life. I didn't touch him.
I didn't kill him,'' Chivarra said in an interview in March.
</P>
<P>
   Magdaleno said the two are now saying that they acted in self
defense and that True's death was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Mr. True was threatening to rape one of the wives,
and so they defended themselves and Mr. True accidentally hit his
head,'' Magdaleno said. ``For me, the only version I am handling is
the official one, their signed confession.''

   DETROIT _ If the least expensive car you offer costs $55,000 and
you want to double your sales, what can you do? For Jaguar Cars
Ltd., the answer seemed simple: Develop new, more affordable models
to attract customers who might like a Jag but had never thought
they could afford one.
</P>
<P>
   Moving down-market can be risky. Mercedes-Benz had to change the
design of its A-Class after that subcompact, which is sold in
Europe but not in America, rolled over in safety tests.
DaimlerChrysler's sales of the Smart, a tiny, innovative car
developed with the Swatch watch company, have fallen short of
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar has no plans to sell anything as small as the A-Class or
the Smart; the Ford Motor Co., Jaguar's parent, will put other
nameplates on its econoboxes. Still, within a couple of years there
will be a compact Jaguar sedan, sized and priced similarly to the
Mercedes C-Class. And for 2000 Jaguar is offering the S-Type, which
competes with medium-sized luxury sedans like Mercedes's E-Class
and BMW's 5-Series.
</P>
<P>
   Starting just above $40,000, the S-Type is about $15,000 less
the Jaguar XJ8, and the company expects it to attract younger
buyers. Jaguar plans to sell about 20,000 S-Types annually in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   My test drives of two versions of the smaller Jaguar, plus
strong early sales figures, suggest that the company is on the
right track. Though smaller and less expensive than its siblings,
this cat shares the traits of the Jaguar species: distinctive
appearance, luxurious accommodations and powerful, graceful
performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rear-drive S-Type feels, looks and acts like a Jaguar
although it shares its basic architecture with the new Lincoln LS _
the first such instance of ``platform sharing'' since Ford bought
Jaguar in 1990. But the engineers have done a remarkable job of
disguising the common underpinnings. The LS feels stiffer, firmer
and _ in a first for Lincoln, quite Germanic; the S-Type is silky,
smooth and plush in the British tradition. This platform will also
be used for a very American car, the 2001 Ford Thunderbird.
</P>
<P>
   I did not immediately fall in love with the look of the S-Type,
as I typically do with Jaguars. The car seemed to lack the brand's
usual sexiness and glamour, as exemplified by the
drop-dead-gorgeous XK8 coupe and convertible. But others clearly
disagreed; many people I encountered thought the car was stunning,
and as I see more S-Types on the roads, its styling has grown on
me.
</P>
<P>
   The car certainly resembles the high-performance 3.8 S-Type of
the 1960s. In particular, the new S-Type's most prominent feature
is an elliptical vertical-bar grille straight out of the Jaguar
history book.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the much-celebrated Mark II 3.8, built from 1959 to
1967, provided inspiration for Geoff Lawson, the design impresario
for the company, who died recently at age 54.
</P>
<P>
   But while current Jaguars generally have the most shapely rumps
on the road, the S-Type's rear end doesn't stand out.
</P>
<P>
   The back was raised to create more trunk space for the car's
presumably more practical owner. At 13.1 cubic feet, the space is
about right in this class, but it is shallow, requiring that
suitcases be laid flat.
</P>
<P>
   While the silhouette is similar to the 1960s models after which
the S-Type was patterned, its proportions differ from its modern
siblings, with their low roofs, long hoods and tapered tails. This
is largely due to the car's more compact size; it is 6.5 inches
shorter than the XJ8. And the rear window evoked the Lincoln Town
Car more than the bigger Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, though, this is clearly a Jaguar, down to the
distinctive scent of the soft leather. There is rich wood, of
course, but it is a lighter ``mushroom-stained maple'' than the
walnut used on other models.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type officially accommodates five, but its back seat is on
the tight side for a car of this size. The front seats are
extremely comfortable and supportive.
</P>
<P>
   The car has the usual luxury-class safety features: dual front
air bags, side front air bags, traction control and anti-lock
brakes. It can be equipped with all kinds of high-tech gadgets,
including rain-detecting windshield wipers; a stability control
that selectively applies the brakes to help prevent skids, and an
obstacle-detection system that beeps, as the car backs toward an
object or a person.
</P>
<P>
   You can have a satellite-guided navigation system with Jaguar
Assist, an emergency messaging system that provides automatic
response if an air bag deploys. But I found the navigation controls
were not at all intuitive; lacking a user's manual or verbal
instructions, I repeatedly tried to program in a destination.
Frustrated, I gave up every time.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type can be ordered with a $4,300 communications package
that includes the most expansive use of speech recognition in any
auto on the road today. Using simple voice commands, the driver can
make calls on the cellular telephone, set the radio station, play a
compact disk or cassette tape and adjust the heat and
air-conditioning. In total, the system allows 44 commands.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Type's driving dynamics are excellent, and the car
delivers graceful power in a purely Jaguar way. The basic engine is
an all-new 3-liter V6 rated at 240 horsepower and 221 foot-pounds
of torque. Also available is a 4-liter V8 used in other Jaguars and
in the LS (281 horsepower, 287 foot-pounds). Both engines are
paired with a smooth five-speed automatic; there will be no stick
shift for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Subtle character differences exist between the V6 and V8 models.
The S-Type with the V8 obviously has more raw power _ impressive
power, indeed, for highway cruising and passing maneuvers. But the
V6 may appeal more to enthusiast drivers, since that car's lighter
weight makes it feel more nimble.
</P>
<P>
   An optional sport package ($1,100) adds more spirited
performance to either version with larger wheels, performance tires
and ``Cats,'' for Computer Active Technology Suspension, which
automatically adjusts the ride from firm to soft depending on how
the car is driven.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar has for decades had the stigma of inferior quality and
dreadful reliability, but all that seems to have changed since Ford
took over. In the most recent ratings by J.D. Power &AMP; Associates,
Jaguar ranked at the top in initial quality, after hovering near
the bottom of the list only seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar has cleverly priced the base versions of the S-Type a few
thousand dollars above the equivalent new Lincolns, but a few
thousand below the 5-Series and the E-Class.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Feline grace in a practical, less pricey package.

SETTLEMENT ENDS WRATH OF WINERIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Finally, they can put a cork in it.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle has ended between the Foxen and Fess Parker
wineries over the use of the Foxen name on their wines.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement was struck this week during a lengthy settlement
conference in a Los Angeles federal courtroom, according to the
parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference of opinion has been resolved,'' said Jenny
Williamson, whose husband co-owns Foxen Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased that it's over,'' said Fess Parker, a former
television star who portrayed Davy Crockett. ``Now we can get on
with business.''
</P>
<P>
   Details, however, are sealed, so only time may reveal how the
wineries' labels are affected. Both sides said they must abide by
the agreement not to disclose how they can or cannot use the Foxen
name in the future, or whether there is any cash settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Relations soured between the two wineries in March and worsened
two months later in a highly publicized trademark lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In his court claim, Foxen Vineyard co-owner Richard Dore
contended that the Fess Parker Winery &AMP; Vineyard used his
registered ``Foxen'' trademark without authorization on Fess Parker
Foxen Cuvee and Fleur de Foxen wines for about three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to trade on our good name and reputation, and
that's flat out wrong,'' Dore said last spring. ``We're
dumbfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   In a counter claim, winemaker Eli Parker, who is the son of Fess
Parker, charged the Foxen winery with fraud in connection with its
trademark registration and sought to cancel the Foxen trademark. He
said that the word was only used on Parker labels to denote his
winery's location along Foxen Canyon Road, north of Los Olivos.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1987, Foxen Vineyard is named in memory of Dore's
great-great-grandfather Benjamin Foxen, an English sea captain and
a northern Santa Barbara County pioneer. The winery and vineyard
are located on 2,000 acres purchased by Foxen in 1837.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Parker said the disputed wine constituted less than 8
percent of Parker's wine production over the three relevant vintage
years.
</P>
<P>
   Foxen Vineyard is staging a fund-raising barbecue and dance on
Aug. 7 to help pay its legal bills, which total more than $90,000.

 &HT;    Dietary goals and the evolution of RDAs
 &HT;    By Rachael Kennedy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 1939. Although the United States has yet to enter World War
II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt calls on doctors to help
determine the nation's readiness for war. Sadly, many young men are
unfit for duty. The diagnosis: malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Roosevelt asks the nation's elite scientists to advise
the government on nutrient needs of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the Food and Nutrition Board creates the first
Recommended Dietary Allowances, working with scant data.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to update the RDAs every five years to help combat
deficiency diseases in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 1994; the RDAs are now the benchmark of
nutritional adequacy. Nutritionists, researchers, the government
and the public use them daily.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the board gears up to revise the 1989 guidelines,
they believe the RDAs need an overhaul. The end result is the
evolution of the Dietary Reference Intakes; revisions will be
complete by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DRIs (are) a comprehensive effort undertaken to include
the current concepts about the roles of nutrients and food in
long-term health, going beyond deficiency diseases,'' states a
recent American Dietetic Association article.
</P>
<P>
   The DRIs include four references:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Adequate Intake: The dietary intake level deemed adequate to
maintain health, determined when adequate scientific support is not
available to establish an RDA. It's used to set goals for healthy
individuals and groups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Estimated Average Requirement : The dietary intake level
estimated to keep 50 percent of a specific group healthy. It's used
to help government agencies and researchers set goals for groups of
people, such as mothers in the federal government's WIC nutritional
program for women, infants and children.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recommended Dietary Allowance: The dietary intake level
sufficient to meet requirements of 98 percent of healthy
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tolerable Upper Intake Level: The maximum level of daily
nutrient intake above which adverse health effects are likely to
occur. It's used to warn individuals of danger if maximum intakes
are regularly exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, the RDAs are no longer focused only on
preventing deficiency diseases. . .. Now they are also aimed at
reducing the risk of diet-related chronic conditions such as heart
disease, diabetes, hypertension and osteoporosis,'' Sandra
Schlicker, senior staff officer on the nutrition board, said in a
statement.

 &HT;    Learning the new ABCs of good nutrition
 &HT;    By Rachael Kennedy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were asked to describe your diet, what would you say?
Would you say it's ``healthy''? Would you say you're getting the
right amount of nutrients?
</P>
<P>
   If you're not sure, then take a look at the new Dietary
Reference Intakes from the Food and Nutrition Board of the National
Academy of Sciences. Some DRIs came out in 1997, some are being
published this year and some will be available in the future. They
should be complete by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, DRI is a generic term for four new health standards
that will offer a more complete picture of nutritional health needs
than the old RDAs (Recommended Dietary Allowances) did. These
include Adequate Intake, Estimated Average Requirement, RDA _ with
a new definition _ and the Tolerable Upper Intake Level, which, if
exceeded regularly, can be risky. (See article below for
definitions.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We use to have the RDAs which were designed expressly for a
healthy population. It was not adequate for all the uses that it's
taken on,'' said Roswell nutritionist and American Dietetic
Association spokeswoman Kathleen Zelman. ``In my practice, the most
beneficial thing to come out of this is the (UL). It helps people
understand where they need to be and where they don't want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this mean? The DRIs, for the first time, are
showing what we need in our diet to prevent osteoporosis, heart
disease and other chronic conditions. Secondly, they detail what
levels of certain nutrients may cause health problems, if exceeded
regularly. New DRIs are out for nutrients affecting bones, as well
as the B-vitamins. This fall, DRIs on antioxidants will be
released. DRIs forthcoming include the macronutrients (protein, fat
and carbohydrates), trace elements (iron, zinc, etc.), electrolytes
and water, and other food components (fiber, phytoestrogens, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   Many customers and clerks at local health stores are unaware of
the changes. That's not surprising considering the Food and
Nutrition Board has yet to publish any information for the
layperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to educate the health professionals until the
(DRIs) are closer to completion. They can then better relate them
to the patient,'' said Jennifer Otton, communication specialist
with the board.
</P>
<P>
   The board has moved slowly, gathering all data available before
making recommendations. At least one public meeting is held with a
broad range of groups _ including supplement-industry officials,
scientific experts and government regulators _ before a
recommendation is approved. ``We want to make sure we make
scientifically justified recommendations,'' said Norm Krinsky, a
Tufts University biochemistry professor and a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved
new labels reflecting the changes, and no one is sure when that
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to wait for the government, you can use charts
accompanying this article and consult a nutritionist for ways to
meet the new levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really where we can come in with our education. There's
a lot of information we can give to consumers so they don't get
bogged down in the numbers,'' said Zelman, who adds she is getting
adequate information and support from the American Dietetic
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the groups that will benefit the most from the new
recommendations are women in childbearing years, people at risk for
heart disease, the elderly and those that have the ``if one's good,
two is better'' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much anecdotal info out there, and now we have
updated scientific values to combat it,'' Zelman said. ``A great
deal of research and consensus goes into this. I have the ultimate
confidence in the recommendations.''

 &HT;    Married priests: 'Reform' within church 'inevitable'
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Friday, Jack McBride celebrated his 28th wedding
anniversary. Sunday, he will celebrate the Catholic Mass.
</P>
<P>
   McBride, 66, who was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood
in 1960, married a member of his church in 1971. The man once known
as father to a parish is also father to two daughters. McBride had
wanted to be a priest since childhood, but because he is not
celibate, he can no longer function as clergy within the church. He
will hold Mass in his home, as he does weekly.
</P>
<P>
   If a priest has been released from his vows by the Vatican, he
can marry within the church but is treated as a layman.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church cannot revoke the sacrament of
ordination to the priesthood, but it does not recognize priests who
marry. ``Men who have been ordained to the priesthood remain
ordained priests through all eternity,'' said Monsignor Peter Dora,
vicar general of the Archdiocese of Atlanta. But, he said, the
mandatory practice of celibacy is a discipline of the church. ``The
fact is, every priest in the Latin rite makes his promises
knowingly and is expected to remain unmarried.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride and thousands of other married priests are hoping that
will change.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 leaders in the crusade for that cause will gather at
Emory University next week for the Fifth Worldwide Congress of the
International Federation of Married Catholic Priests. They
represent 15 countries and more than 40 organizations of married
priests and other Catholics who want change in the church. Corpus,
a 25-year-old organization of married priests in the United States,
is combining its annual convention with the congress.
</P>
<P>
   The main message of the gathering, being held for the first time
in North America, ``is that here is a whole cadre of Catholic
priests, trained, educated, zealous, many of them with a fire in
their belly, still excited about the ministry, still concerned
about the care of souls,'' said McBride, a local member of Corpus.
``They are saying to the church, `Why don't you use us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Archdiocese of Atlanta has a healthy crop of
priests and seminarians, elsewhere in the country the church is
suffering from a declining number of clergy. Since 1990, Catholics
in the archdiocese have almost doubled, from 159,800 to 311,000,
and the total number of priests has increased from 181 to 234. Of
those, 121 are priests officially attached to the Archdiocese of
Atlanta, up from 106 in 1990. The rest are part of religious orders
working in the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   The future looks even brighter. The number of seminarians
training for the Atlanta Archdiocese has grown from 17 in 1990 to
62 today.
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, however, the trend is downward. In
1995, there were 49,052 priests in the country. In 1999, that
number has shrunk to 46,352. Ordinations to the priesthood were
down from 511 in 1995 to 460 in 1999, part of a steady decline from
almost 1,000 in 1965. At the same time, the Catholic population of
the country grew from 45.6 million in 1965 to 59.2 million in 1999,
leaving 2,617 parishes without a resident priest.
</P>
<P>
   Married priests could help alleviate some of this shortage,
Corpus leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, married men who hold the office of permanent deacon are
absorbing some of the priestly functions. Permanent deacons,
recognized by the Vatican since 1967, perform many liturgical and
pastoral duties, but may not celebrate Mass. Married men may be
ordained to the diaconate, but single men ordained as deacons
cannot marry, and married deacons whose wives die may not remarry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Roman branch of the church spurns ordained priests
who marry, some Eastern rites within Catholicism do ordain married
men to the priesthood under rules similar to those for the
permanent diaconate in the Latin rite.
</P>
<P>
   And, Roman Catholic dioceses have also accepted some married
Lutheran and Episcopal priests, including two in the Archdiocese of
Atlanta. But far more priests are moving in the other direction,
since many Catholic priests who marry later become Episcopal
priests.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bob Hudak is one.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak, 51, is pastor of the Episcopal Church of the Nativity in
Fayetteville (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   In all of his conscious memory, Hudak said, he wanted to be a
priest. As a kindergartner in his New Jersey home, he played Mass
at a little altar his grandfather built, keeping his back to his
imaginary congregation, in proper pre-Vatican II form.
</P>
<P>
   At the tender age of 14, he left home to begin preparing for the
priesthood in the Franciscan order, drawn by St. Francis of
Assisi's view of the interconnectedness and worth of all of
creation and all people. He remembers the ``lump in my throat and
the ache in my stomach'' as he watched his family drive away in
their 1957 Chevrolet. The separation was worthwhile, he thought,
because it enabled him to become a Franciscan priest. Celibacy was
a requirement he was willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   He came south in 1985, and was directing a community ministry
and working as associate pastor of St. Pius X in Greensboro, N.C.,
in 1990 when his life took a turn.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his ministry was to connect with other ministries in the
area. One of them was directed by the woman who would become his
wife. For a while, he avoided her precisely because he was afraid
he was becoming attracted to her, he said. After about a year, when
she questioned his aloofness and asked whether she had offended
him, he confessed the truth. ``She ended up opening up and saying
she felt the same way,'' he said. ``From then on, it was a very
difficult thing. I don't know how we got through that time, but I
do know it was by the grace of God.''
</P>
<P>
   After a time of soul-searching, he left the active Roman
Catholic priesthood and they married in 1991. They now have two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the church, he became program director of
Atlanta's Common Ground, a day center for people with AIDS, and
later headed the Atlanta Interfaith AIDS Network. But he missed the
priesthood. His journey to the Episcopal Church began with a class
at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in DeKalb County. His intent
to re-enter the full-time ministry was sealed at an Easter Vigil
service with Atlanta's Emmaus Community. He celebrated his first
public Eucharist as an Episcopal priest on Easter 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak decided to move to the Episcopal Church rather than stay
in the Catholic Church and fight for the married priesthood there,
he said, because ``I don't like to set myself up for
disappointment. I just knew that the expectations I had would not
be realized in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has lost no love for the Catholic Church.
``Eventually, I became like a person who gets received into an
adoptive family and is able to look back on the family of origin
with love, appreciation and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Hudak, those in Corpus have chosen to stay within the
church and fight for change. The organization, which had its
beginnings in the mid-1970s, a time of tumult in the church, grew
out of a group called the Society of Priests for a Free Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Ann Breyer was there. Breyer, a Corpus board member, is on
the research faculty of Florida State University. She was a Sister
of Mercy until 1969, when she married a Carmelite priest she had
met when both were graduate students at the University of Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Paul VI had just issued his encyclical ``Humanae Vitae,''
which reaffirmed the church's ban on ``artificial'' birth control,
and many priests believed his statement was unrealistic. Many were
also frustrated that the church seemed to be slowing down or
turning away from some of the modernization and reform promised by
the second Vatican Council. Some left the church; others were
squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
   The movement they founded was based on the belief that the
church could change, including accepting married priests.
</P>
<P>
   Corpus' most important role is that it is ``a witness to an
alternative lifestyle,'' said Breyer. ``It's much easier to be a
gay priest than a married priest. If you're a gay priest, it's
swept under the rug. You're not forced to leave. You don't become a
pariah, which is what happens when you're a married priest.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance by the church of married Episcopal priests was ``a
terrible affront,'' she said, ``but what did it say? I don't know
that Rome really thought about this _ but it did say there is a
compatibility between marriage and ordination. The church could
never again say there's no such thing as a married priesthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike those 1970s activists, many men marrying and leaving the
priesthood today do not join Corpus, whether or not they stay in
the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our numbers are staying steady, but we are not growing by
leaps and bounds,'' said Anthony Padovano, who served for 10 years
as president of Corpus, which has more than 2,500 members. ``I
think part of that reason is that many of the priests who resign
now tend to leave the whole structure. That's one element. Another
element is a fair number of those who resign now choose not to get
involved with the fairly considerable work it involves to dialogue
and challenge the institutional church. It's quite clear that
enormous numbers of priests are resigning in the United States; the
drop in seminary enrollment is extraordinarily severe. But that has
not correlated into large numbers of resigned priests joining us.''
</P>
<P>
   Padovano, 64, was teaching in Texas after about 15 years in the
active priesthood when he fell in love with a graduate student. He
married her in 1974, the year Corpus began.
</P>
<P>
   He remains in the Catholic Church, he said, because ``I feel
that it's my home. I belong there. I know the culture of the
church. Another fundamental reason is that if I love the Catholic
Church, which I do, and I believe reform is inevitable, I can
witness more powerfully for that reform from within the institution
rather than as an outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory University religion professor Eugene Bianchi thinks
eventual acceptance of a married priesthood is inevitable. Bianchi,
a thrice-married Catholic priest, is studying current and former
members of the Jesuit order, which is now half the size it was in
1960 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're coming to the end of a 900-year experiment with
mandated clerical celibacy, which was a reform movement in the 12th
century as a way to pull together the scattered feudal church,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Protestant Reformation, the trend has been back toward
married clergy, and the trend was accelerated in the 1960s with the
sweeping changes of the second Vatican Council and the social and
sexual revolution in culture, he said. ``That brings us right up to
Corpus.''
</P>
<P>
   Bianchi says that it is not celibacy but mandatory celibacy that
today's reformers oppose. ``There are always men who find it a
congenial mode and some of them do great work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Married men can also do great work and can bring a wider
perspective to ministry, said McBride, who now operates a hospice
in Covington with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I look back,'' he said when asked whether he misses
his days in the active priesthood. ``I think everybody does. I
still dream about it. I love the priesthood. I love the ministry.
But I think my education as a priest started when I left the
diocese. My vision got broader. I became more aware of the
experience of others. What I've learned through life experience is
much more important than what I learned in seminary.''

 &HT;    Dietary goals and the evolution of RDAs
 &HT;    By Rachael Kennedy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 1939. Although the United States has yet to enter World War
II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt calls on doctors to help
determine the nation's readiness for war. Sadly, many young men are
unfit for duty. The diagnosis: malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, Roosevelt asks the nation's elite scientists to advise
the government on nutrient needs of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the Food and Nutrition Board creates the first
Recommended Dietary Allowances, working with scant data.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to update the RDAs every five years to help combat
deficiency diseases in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 1994; the RDAs are now the benchmark of
nutritional adequacy. Nutritionists, researchers, the government
and the public use them daily.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the board gears up to revise the 1989 guidelines,
they believe the RDAs need an overhaul. The end result is the
evolution of the Dietary Reference Intakes; revisions will be
complete by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DRIs (are) a comprehensive effort undertaken to include
the current concepts about the roles of nutrients and food in
long-term health, going beyond deficiency diseases,'' states a
recent American Dietetic Association article.
</P>
<P>
   The DRIs include four references:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Adequate Intake: The dietary intake level deemed adequate to
maintain health, determined when adequate scientific support is not
available to establish an RDA. It's used to set goals for healthy
individuals and groups.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Estimated Average Requirement : The dietary intake level
estimated to keep 50 percent of a specific group healthy. It's used
to help government agencies and researchers set goals for groups of
people, such as mothers in the federal government's WIC nutritional
program for women, infants and children.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recommended Dietary Allowance: The dietary intake level
sufficient to meet requirements of 98 percent of healthy
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tolerable Upper Intake Level: The maximum level of daily
nutrient intake above which adverse health effects are likely to
occur. It's used to warn individuals of danger if maximum intakes
are regularly exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, the RDAs are no longer focused only on
preventing deficiency diseases. . .. Now they are also aimed at
reducing the risk of diet-related chronic conditions such as heart
disease, diabetes, hypertension and osteoporosis,'' Sandra
Schlicker, senior staff officer on the nutrition board, said in a
statement.

 &HT;    Learning the new ABCs of good nutrition
 &HT;    By Rachael Kennedy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you were asked to describe your diet, what would you say?
Would you say it's ``healthy''? Would you say you're getting the
right amount of nutrients?
</P>
<P>
   If you're not sure, then take a look at the new Dietary
Reference Intakes from the Food and Nutrition Board of the National
Academy of Sciences. Some DRIs came out in 1997, some are being
published this year and some will be available in the future. They
should be complete by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, DRI is a generic term for four new health standards
that will offer a more complete picture of nutritional health needs
than the old RDAs (Recommended Dietary Allowances) did. These
include Adequate Intake, Estimated Average Requirement, RDA _ with
a new definition _ and the Tolerable Upper Intake Level, which, if
exceeded regularly, can be risky. (See article below for
definitions.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We use to have the RDAs which were designed expressly for a
healthy population. It was not adequate for all the uses that it's
taken on,'' said Roswell nutritionist and American Dietetic
Association spokeswoman Kathleen Zelman. ``In my practice, the most
beneficial thing to come out of this is the (UL). It helps people
understand where they need to be and where they don't want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this mean? The DRIs, for the first time, are
showing what we need in our diet to prevent osteoporosis, heart
disease and other chronic conditions. Secondly, they detail what
levels of certain nutrients may cause health problems, if exceeded
regularly. New DRIs are out for nutrients affecting bones, as well
as the B-vitamins. This fall, DRIs on antioxidants will be
released. DRIs forthcoming include the macronutrients (protein, fat
and carbohydrates), trace elements (iron, zinc, etc.), electrolytes
and water, and other food components (fiber, phytoestrogens, etc.)
</P>
<P>
   Many customers and clerks at local health stores are unaware of
the changes. That's not surprising considering the Food and
Nutrition Board has yet to publish any information for the
layperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to educate the health professionals until the
(DRIs) are closer to completion. They can then better relate them
to the patient,'' said Jennifer Otton, communication specialist
with the board.
</P>
<P>
   The board has moved slowly, gathering all data available before
making recommendations. At least one public meeting is held with a
broad range of groups _ including supplement-industry officials,
scientific experts and government regulators _ before a
recommendation is approved. ``We want to make sure we make
scientifically justified recommendations,'' said Norm Krinsky, a
Tufts University biochemistry professor and a board member.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved
new labels reflecting the changes, and no one is sure when that
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to wait for the government, you can use charts
accompanying this article and consult a nutritionist for ways to
meet the new levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really where we can come in with our education. There's
a lot of information we can give to consumers so they don't get
bogged down in the numbers,'' said Zelman, who adds she is getting
adequate information and support from the American Dietetic
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the groups that will benefit the most from the new
recommendations are women in childbearing years, people at risk for
heart disease, the elderly and those that have the ``if one's good,
two is better'' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much anecdotal info out there, and now we have
updated scientific values to combat it,'' Zelman said. ``A great
deal of research and consensus goes into this. I have the ultimate
confidence in the recommendations.''

 &HT;    Armstrong holds steady lead in Tour de France
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ Lance Armstrong finished among a pack of
86 riders in Friday's 18th stage of the Tour de France. But with
only two more days of competition in this torturous three-week
cycling event, the yellow-jerseyed Armstrong was jubilant as he
allowed himself to toy with the idea of winning one of the world's
most prestigious sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to get this done,'' Armstrong said about 30 minutes
after he finished the final stage of the three-week long Tour.
``I've got only two more days.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Armstrong showed how comfortable he has become
crashing this esteemed European event when he pulled up fellow
Austinite and Lance Armstrong Foundation fund-raiser Elizabeth
Kreutz to the winners podium, giving her a hug and handing her his
large bouquet of yellow daffodils, zinnias and snapdragons.
Armstrong's wife, Kristin, and his mother, Linda, will be among the
thousands who will watch today as the participants ride a
57-kilometer time trial that begins and ends at Futuroscope.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was mobbed by autograph-hungry fans as he calmly rode
from the finish line to his team's nearby hotel. About two dozen
workers then lined the main hallway of the hotel in hopes of
catching a glimpse of the brash Texan who has shocked the rabidly
patriotic French cycling fans with his riding abilities.
</P>
<P>
   No one is conceding the race, which ends in a basic victory
stroll down the Champs Elysee in Paris on Sunday afternoon, but
Armstrong's lead is basically insurmountable, with his 6-minute,
15-second margin over second-place Fernando Escartin considered an
above-average cushion compared to the past 85 Tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone has conceded it to me,'' Armstrong said,
who rides for the U.S. Postal Service. ``But that's a lot of time.
On paper, there's nothing to suggest that I shouldn't win this
thing. I have to concentrate and ride within myself. Unless I crash
and can't get back up, if I broke something, then I should be all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, there is not much time for the other 140 riders to
cut into Armstrong's lead or wish him a catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Today's stage fits the style of Armstrong more so than it does
his main competition, Escartin and Switzerland's Alex Zulle, the
only riders with a chance of catching him.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong won the prologue that kicked off the Tour at Le Puy Du
Fou on July 3rd, and then claimed the time trial and the yellow
jersey on July 11 at Metz, a town near the France-Germany border.
Since then, Armstrong has yet to relinquish the yellow jersey worn
by the overall leader.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's stage, which was briefly interrupted outside of Jonzac
by protesters trying to seek publicity for a local winery, was
relatively noneventful. Temperatures on this cloudy, windy
afternoon inched their way up to the 60s as riders strolled through
the picturesque French farmlands about 300 miles south of Paris.
The clouds broke at the end of the stage, where the finish line
split the middle of Futuroscope, the steel-and-chrome amusement
park that attracts visitors with high-tech scientific exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   None of the top riders tried to break away and win the stage,
leaving the victory for Gianpaolo Mondini. The 28-year-old Italian
won his first-ever stage by sprinting away from a pack of 12 riders
about 4.5 kilometers from the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong officially finished 31st, 3:07 minutes behind Mondini,
but he shared the time with 85 others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a pretty boring stage, really,'' said George
Hincapie, Armstrong's teammate. ``And that is just what we hoped
for. We didn't even have to do that much tempo at the front,
because so many other teams had their own interests to protect. ...
or simply rode for a stage win.''
</P>
<P>
   The French teams were the ones struggling for a stage win.
Frenchman Jean Cyril-Robin was among the last breakaway group, but
he allowed Mondini to pass him near the end. If a French rider
fails to win either today or Sunday, it will mark the first time a
rider from the host country has failed to capture a stage since
1926, when the Tour was won by Lucien Buysse of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The French media, tabloid and mainstream, has attacked Armstrong
since he won his first mountain stage at Le Grand-Bornand
Sestrieres, accusing Armstrong of using performance-enhancing
drugs. Earlier this week, they reported that traces of a chemical
had showed up in Armstrong's blood test, only to later find out it
was a skin cream.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was tested at the start of the Tour, and he has
submitted to drug tests each day that he has worn the yellow
jersey. Tour officials tested Armstrong and 16 other riders Friday
morning and none showed signs of drug use. Armstrong said Friday he
believes the French media have been critical because none of the
riders they normally cover have been doing well in the home
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so obvious they're jealous and desperate,'' Armstrong
said. ``They're just grasping at straws.''

 &HT;    Kudzu: the green monster
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ronnie Webb stands on the corner of Shadydale Avenue
and Claire Drive on a pleasant July day and watches as a 17-ton
front end loader attacks a stand of kudzu in a vacant South Fulton
lot, scraping and digging and depositing yards of dirt and uprooted
vines and leaves into one pickup truck after another.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, a route supervisor with the city's Department of Public
Works, is on familiar ground. The city has cleared this tenacious
patch of green year after year, since ordinances written during the
missing and murdered children crisis made out-of-control kudzu a
misdemeanor in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   When Webb's crew is finished the lot is as smooth and barren as
a NASCAR dirt track. But they'll be back again next year, he says,
when the Terminator of weeds has raised itself from the dead, and
reclaimed this same vacant lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read an article that said in Japan they eat kudzu like we
eat collard greens,'' says Webb, ``but I can't picture me eating no
kudzu.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the city, Petunia, Chopper and Mule harbor no such
reservations. These residents of Inman Park love kudzu so much
they've stripped their yard clean of every last rhizome, and their
owner, Christine Sibley, must bring them greenery chopped from
neighboring yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are spoiled fat goats,'' Sibley says.
</P>
<P>
   Goats and front end loaders are two of the weapons that we
deploy in our war against kudzu, a war we've been losing for four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Brought to this country from Japan in 1876, kudzu was finally
recognized as a threat by the federal government in 1953. Since
then billions in public and private money have been dumped into
efforts to dig, burn, poison and even eat the weed, while it has
steadily expanded into new territory. There are an estimated 7
million infested acres in the East, a number that grows by 120,000
acres every year.
</P>
<P>
   While the vine extends from Massachusetts to Florida, and as far
west as Texas, kudzu's sunny heartland is in Georgia, Alabama and
Mississippi. Any traveler of rural highways in these states has
seen the awe-inspiring topiary that results when kudzu climbs and
swallows trees and power lines, creating a roadside gauntlet of
fanciful monsters dressed in emerald.
</P>
<P>
   We are now at the height of the growing season, when the green
energy steaming off this mighty vegetable is almost audible, when
kudzu grows a foot a day and creeps over sidewalks and highways. In
the next few weeks the vines will produce hanging clusters of
purple blossoms that emit a piercing, sweet aroma akin to the smell
of grape gum.
</P>
<P>
   An unstoppable force of nature that flattens forests,
obliterates farms, swallows houses and cars, shorts out power lines
and reduces diverse woodlands to an impenetrable monoculture of
matted vines, kudzu is, just the same, as much a part of Dixie as
iced tea and red clay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there might not be much of Dixie left if not for this
hardy plant. ``The South would be in the Gulf of Mexico if we
didn't have kudzu,'' says Jimmy Adams, co-owner of Adams-Briscoe
Seed Company in Jackson, east of Griffin. Perhaps Adams, 49, is
biased. He sells kudzu seed. Critics liken that to selling air
pollution. But there is a kudzu demand, for reasons that are a
hundred years old.
</P>
<P>
   Greedy overplanting of cotton, the failure to rotate crops and
other disastrous farming techniques depleted soils throughout the
Southeast during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As the
region's topsoil eroded into the sea, the boll weevil arrived,
accompanied by the Depression. Agriculture began to dry up and blow
away.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu kept the South from turning into another Dust Bowl. While
many folks are under the impression that kudzu somehow escaped from
a mad botanist's lab, the truth is that the introduction of kudzu
to the region was the result of a sustained, expensive effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Soil Conservation Service, established by Congress in 1933
to reduce soil erosion in the South, provided 84 million kudzu
seedlings to landowners. Depression-era workers with the Civilian
Conservation Corps worked at planting public land, and the
government offered farmers up to $8 an acre to grow the
nitrogen-fixing legume, which not only enriched and protected
topsoil, but served as a protein-rich forage for domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
   By 1947 there were 3 million acres of Pueraria lobata being
cultivated in the unsuspecting South.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite the fact that the federal government has finally
declared it a noxious weed, kudzu is still sought by Adams'
customers, who buy about 500 pounds of kudzu seed a year, which he
imports from Guatemala. Some use it to fight erosion, but ``the big
consumers last year were meat goat producers,'' Adams says.
</P>
<P>
   Goat breeders grow kudzu to feed their animals. That, in itself,
is no easy trick. ``A lot of people think you throw it on the
ground and run,'' says South Georgia goat farmer James ``Red''
Smith, 53. ``But kudzu is hard to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a fraction of most kudzu seeds are viable, and only 20
percent of seeds that germinate survive. Agricultural textbooks
from the 1920s and '30s recommend raising the seedlings in a
nursery, and transplanting them in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has about 230 nannies on his Brooks County farm, 20 miles
from the Florida border. Instead of growing his own kudzu, he
loaned 160 goats to a neighbor who has 30 acres of timber being
eaten up by the vines. This worked well until wild dogs got inside
the fencing and killed many of his goats.
</P>
<P>
   Goats love the weed, but deplete it rapidly. ``Its trouble is
that it's so good they graze it right out,'' says Smith. ``They
pull it up and it dies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as big guns in the war on kudzu, goats have a few
weaknesses. Even the heftiest Nubian can't pull up a kudzu taproot,
which can grow 9 feet into the ground and weigh up to 400 pounds.
Goats leap most fencing, or strangle themselves if tethered to a
stake, owners say. Many breeds also refuse to be herded by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Sheep, on the other hand, are easily herded, and also enjoy
kudzu. The state of Florida and the city of Tallahassee are using
small herds of sheep to control invasive pest plants.
</P>
<P>
   Some came from Dick Henry's Concord, N.H., herd, which he also
uses to control vegetation under transmission lines in the northern
forests. Henry says a Florida Department of Environmental
Protection pilot project that unleashed 500 of his sheep on canal
banks in North Florida could expand in the future. ``In British
Columbia they use 50,000 to 100,000 sheep to clear vegetation.''
Sheep, he says, are heat tolerant, and could be the answer to the
South's kudzu quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Hoots, the self-described ``Kudzu Queen'' of Georgia,
would like to extend that strategy, and get humans to consume their
fair share of the weed. ``If you can't beat it, eat it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Hoots, 47, is author of several books about kudzu, and maker of
kudzu jelly, and kudzu-vine baskets carried in such stores as Ed &AMP;
Phoebe's on the square in Marietta. ``We sell cases and cases of
the jelly,'' says co-owner Ivonne McDonald, adding that it has a
flavor similar to apple jelly, with a subtle aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   Hoots' kudzu syrup is also used as the glaze on the kudzu kebab
served at the Kudzu Grill in Chattanooga. ``It's probably one of
our best-selling items,'' says kitchen manager Ted Flint of the
pork loin dish.
</P>
<P>
   Jelly, baskets and more will be on display at the Providence
Canyon State Park's Kudzu Takeover Day, Aug. 7. Providence Canyon,
an hour south of Columbus, is itself an emblem of the forces that
brought kudzu to the South. Once home to cotton farmers, the land
eroded to a depth of 150 feet from poor soil management. As the
``canyons'' widened, structures plunged into the cracks, including
the 19th century Providence United Methodist Church building that
gave the region its name. Despite the planting of kudzu there,
erosion continues.
</P>
<P>
   Which goes to show that kudzu can't solve every soil problem.
Flora Tolar's father must have sensed this back in the 1930s,
because every time the Civilian Conservation boys came by to plant
kudzu near his Mississippi farm, he'd dig it up again.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the plant took hold. ``We have hundreds of acres around
us,'' says Tolar, 66, who is Hoots' Mississippi counterpart. ``If I
didn't close the doors and windows at night it would probably come
through the house.''
</P>
<P>
   This genial defender of the green takes advantage of the
availability by using every part of the plant. The leaves she cooks
likes collards (''it tastes horrible if you don't add a lot of
seasoning to it''), dries for tea (''unless you put honey or sugar
with it, it tastes kind of strange'') or fries with a light
breading. She makes a salad from the sprouts and flowers, and
steeps the flowers for an extract to make kudzu wine and kudzu
jelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long fight,'' says the Batesville retiree, who
lives 20 miles from Oxford. ``I think kudzu could eventually feed
the world. People want to eradicate it, but we could do that by
eating it.''
</P>
<P>
   James Miller, 55, a forest ecologist with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Forest Service, and an adjunct professor at Auburn
University, has spent so many years tromping through waist-high
kudzu vines that he's allergic to the blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   He doubts that there are enough hungry people to eat our kudzu
problem. There are herbicides that will kill the plant after five
years of reapplications, he says, but the cost _ about $1,000 an
acre _ is prohibitive. He says that the kudzu-eating ``time bomb''
caterpillar, developed by North Carolina State University
scientists, will also be costly to deploy.
</P>
<P>
   The best solution, Miller says, is to bring a carefully selected
natural enemy from among the 300 insects that feed on kudzu in its
homeland of China.
</P>
<P>
   What then? Will we then unleash a new pest on the West, an
insect that's even worse than the plant?
</P>
<P>
   No, Miller says, adding that biological control research is
exacting and restrictions are strong. ``The chances of making a
mistake are slim.''
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Mr. Kudzu'' in the agricultural community, Miller is
frequently approached by foresters and agronomists on the West
Coast, who want to grow the plant to study it.
</P>
<P>
   He politely declines to send them seeds. ``I tell them you don't
want to be known as the person who brought kudzu into Nevada or
Oregon or Washington.''

   BUSH-FAITH _ AUSTIN, Texas _ On Thursday, GOP presidential
front-runner George W. Bush announced some specifics on his ideas
for faith-based programs at the federal level. As governor, Bush
has aggressively promoted partnerships between government and
faith-based groups, which he says can provide many social services
more effectively _ and cost-efficiently _ than the state
bureaucracy. But it isn't clear how effective the partnerships
between Texas and faith-based groups have been. In fact, nobody is
even sure how many of them there are. We watch a faith-based group
in action, talk to people who say such groups have changed their

faith-based groups forge closer relationships. (Greenberger, Austin

SERIES FOR SPORTS CARS HAS BIG PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RALPH LEEF   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ The customer-friendly format allows fans to see
the cars up close and get autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is world class.
</P>
<P>
   Admission remains a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the almost-too-good-to-be-true American Le Mans
Series _ professional sports car racing that two-time series
prototype champion Wayne Taylor of South Africa calls ``the
best-kept secret in the world of motorsports.''
</P>
<P>
   That secret is getting out. It will be further exposed Sunday at
Sears Point Raceway here when NBC televises live the final 90
minutes of the 2 hour, 45 minute race. There will be a similar
broadcast at next week's race in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge for us,'' said Taylor, who will drive a $900,000
Doyle-Risi Ferrari 333 SP around the 2.52-mile course at speeds
that would make NASCAR Winston Cup drivers blanch. ``Finally, all
the ingredients are there to make the series go.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the muscle cars of NASCAR's Winston Cup have
exploded onto the national scene, traditional sports car racing has
foundered. For years, under the banner of the International Motor
Sports Association, professional sports car racing lagged far
behind most other race forms.
</P>
<P>
   Things got so bad in 1997 that Sears Point Raceway officials
decided not to include the race in its '98 schedule. Yet the
three-hour IMSA race at Sears Point in 1996 was one of the all-time
greats at the 30-year-old course. Taylor edged Italian Max Papis by
0.198 of a second in a field that included drivers from 13
countries. But only 5,000 spectators attended that race and just
8,000 came to the 1997 race.
</P>
<P>
   It was worse last year at Road Atlanta and Mosport Park in
Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada. Although customer counts are a
well-kept secret, drivers and officials estimate there were 3,000
fans at Road Atlanta and 2,000 at Mosport.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers are way up at the same tracks this year,
according to American Le Mans Series executive director Bill
Donaldson, who spent 19 years at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The first three in the eight-race series have been successes, he
said, and included crowds of 100,000 at Sebring and 30,000 at Road
Atlanta and Mosport. ``Not bad if you look back a year ago. We're
expecting crowds to be up substantially everywhere we go.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden interest? Drivers point to one man: Don Panoz of
Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz purchased the Mosport, Road Atlanta and Sebring tracks and
the Professional Sports Car Series from Seattle's Andy Evans. He
changed the name of the series to Le Mans, in homage to the classic
France race that annually draw upwards of 450,000 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz, who gained much of his wealth when his pharmaceutical
research group developed the nicotine patch, has moved quickly, and
boldly, in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far he has done more than anyone has expected,'' said
Taylor, who was an outspoken critic of Evans and his Professional
Sports Car group that couldn't get the series out of neutral. ``He
has the sport and the fans at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The first key move by Panoz was to negotiate a network TV
contract, which boosted the circuit and improved the standing of
the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the TV contract closed the deal for his Olive Garden
sponsorship. ``I couldn't sell my sponsors on a series that is on
SpeedVision,'' said Taylor, who is the only man to ever win his
prototype class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 24 Hours of
Daytona, the 12 Hours of Sebring and last year's 10-hour Petit Le
Mans at Road Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Weidensall, director of broadcast operations for the
American Le Mans Series, said NBC will stay with ALMS next year
when the series is expected to expand to 14 races, eight in the
states, three in Europe and three in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will televise only Sears Point, Portland on Aug.1 and
portions of the six-hour, 1,000-mile Petit Le Mans on Sept. 18 live
this year. ESPN2 televised the 12 Hours of Sebring. The other races
are being televised by CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said Panoz felt that the Le Mans name, despite the
European connotation, would help unify American professional sports
car racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're leveraging on the Le Mans brand name,'' Donaldson said.
``We have a 10-year contract to use that name and we are also going
with the rules of the Automobile Club de l'Ouest to create
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the series was plagued by infighting over rules that
seemed to change faster than the ink could dry on the new rulebook.
</P>
<P>
   Panoz also sought well-known racer Lyn St. James to head up an
all-women's series _ the Women's Global GT. Panoz is well aware of
Winston Cup racing's popularity among female fans and he wants to
tap into that market, if possible, by giving women their own
series.
</P>
<P>
   But Panoz and his group still have hurdles, including
establishing public recognition of its cars and drivers. There are
no familiar names like Jeff Gordon or Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The LMP point leaders after the first three events are Elliott
Forbes-Robinson; Butch Leitzinger; Alex Caffi; Taylor; David
Brabham; Ross Bentley; Chris Bingham; Erick Bernard; Didier Theys
and Jim Downing.
</P>
<P>
   The Panoz group _ with the help of network TV _ must also
educate viewers about the cars. No easy chore.
</P>
<P>
   Visualize, if you can, the winning American Le Mans Series car
at the recent Road Atlanta race. It was the Riley &AMP; Scott Mk
III/Judd co-driven by Eric van de Poele and Mimmo Schiattarella.
How about the Ferrari 333 SP _ driven by Mauro Baldi of Monte
Carlo, Monaco and Theys? Get the picture?
</P>
<P>
   There's another wrench in the works. The American Le Mans Series
main event features three races in one. There are the very fast
prototypes _ 22 are among the record 48 feature race entries at
Sears Point _ the GTS (Grand Touring Sedans) and the GT class.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek Ferrari 333 SPs and Riley &AMP; Scotts, Porsche 911 GTIs
and Panoz LMPs are hand-built and designed for speed. The GTS cars
are led by the C5R Corvette, Dodge Viper and factory-chassis
Porsches. The GT class features cars that are the closest to
off-the-assembly-line production cars, mostly Porsches and BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   It is great racing, even if you can't tell one class from
another. For those who tire of the really fast prototypes up front,
there are pitched battles among the top GTS cars in the middle of
the pack and the closest races are usually among the GT class at
the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the American Le Mans series know success won't come
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a process that will take some time to build,'' said
Donaldson, who was executive vice president when he left
Indianapolis Motor Speedway more than a year ago to work with
Panoz. ``We have the equipment and technology and talented drivers.
Now we need to give them exposure.''

   CYC-TOURDEFRANCE _ Lance Armstrong finished among a pack of 86
riders in Friday's 18th stage of the Tour de France. But with only
two more days of competing in this grueling three-week event, and
given his large lead that no one has successfully challenged, the
yellow- shirted Armstrong was jubilant as he strode to the podium
to stand alongside stage winner Gianpaolo Mondini. Although no one
is conceding the race, which ends in a basic victory stroll down
the Champs Elysee in Paris Sunday afternoon, Armstrong's lead is
basically insurmountable. (Halliburton, Austin American-Statesman)

the Gong Show rather than see the illegal chop block by Texas Tech
wide receiver Derek Dorris that ripped up his right knee. ``I've
never seen it. I don't care to look at it,'' Hicks said Friday at
the Big 12 Conference football media day. ``There's nothing I can

just have got to live with it and go on.'' (Riggs, Austin

conviction in 1978. After failing to earn enough votes for
induction from the Baseball Writers of America, Cepeda finally
earned a spot in Cooperstown as the Veterans Committee voted him in
this year. Cepeda shares his thoughts while attending the National
Sports Collectors Convention at the Georgia World Congress Center.

   CYC-TOURDEFRANCE _ Lance Armstrong finished among a pack of 86
riders in Friday's 18th stage of the Tour de France. But with only
two more days of competing in this grueling three-week event, and
given his large lead that no one has successfully challenged, the
yellow- shirted Armstrong was jubilant as he strode to the podium
to stand alongside stage winner Gianpaolo Mondini. Although no one
is conceding the race, which ends in a basic victory stroll down
the Champs Elysee in Paris Sunday afternoon, Armstrong's lead is
basically insurmountable. (Halliburton, Austin American-Statesman)

 &HT;    Celestine Sibley is recuperating at home
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Celestine
Sibley is suffering ill health and is recuperating at Sweet Apple,
her home in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   A column Sibley wrote just before her health declined will
appear Sunday in Dixie Living. Then her column, which also appears
three times a week in the Living section, will be on hiatus
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Regular readers of her column will know of Sibley's earlier
health problems, which she has reported in a characteristically
unself-conscious style. She has also alluded to her current
situation.
</P>
<P>
   She was treated for breast cancer in the summer of 1995. At the
time she wrote: ``My health has never been of o'er-weening interest
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the cancer has returned, said Dr. Martin York, a medical
oncologist at Piedmont Hospital, who began treating Sibley in 1995.
The cancer has spread to the bones of her leg and a single area
inside her brain, York said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are able to control her symptoms with high doses of
medications,'' York said. ``But she's really pretty sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley was slowed down by a heart attack last year, but
continued writing her column and driving herself to work each day.
``She's a remarkable human being,'' said York.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley, 85, was hospitalized twice this month but remains in
good spirits, her granddaughter Sibley Fleming said. ``She's so
get-up-and-go. She was driving up until the day before she (was
admitted). She's not going to relinquish her car keys easily to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming added that readers and friends have offered tremendous
support. ``The family really does appreciate everything everybody
has done, all the food and flowers and concern.''

PENTAGON SCIENTISTS AT WORK ON SCI-FI WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 25)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the battlefield of the future, land mines will
unearth themselves and burrow elsewhere if they sense they have
been detected. Swarms of tiny flying robots, no longer than six
inches, will spot enemy tanks and relay targeting data by satellite
to commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Far from science fiction, the projects are on the drawing board
of the Pentagon's research and development think tank, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.
</P>
<P>
   Mines are a cost-effected means of denying an enemy a large
swath of a battlefield, or at the very least, forcing an opposing
army to stop its advance and shift resources to mine-clearing.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the adversary overcomes a minefield by carving out a
narrow path, a process that can take hours, depending upon the size
of the minefield.
</P>
<P>
   DARPA, with a $2 billion annual budget, is at the beginning
stages of developing what scientists call a ``self-healing
minefield'' that would tie up an adversary for an even longer
period of time and make obsolete so-called anti-personnel mines,
which have claimed the lives of thousands of innocent civilians
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that a network of hundreds of technologically savvy,
tank-killing mines would be buried along an enemy's frontier. The
mines would be outfitted with sophisticated sensors and a wireless
communication system so that they could ``talk'' with one another.
</P>
<P>
   If an enemy soldier attempts to clear a path through the
minefield, the mines would relay a distress call to the others,
spring up through the ground, move to a nearby location and bury
themselves again.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, one mine would be able to tell another mine that
``something's changed'' and then ``the anti-tank mine could
reposition itself,'' said Frank Fernandez, the director of DARPA.
</P>
<P>
   A network of mines would change the dynamic of mine-clearing and
buy U.S. forces more time in the heat of battle because it ``forces
the adversary from clearing a small area to having to clear the
whole minefield,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's scientists are facing tough technical hurdles of
how exactly the mines would move from location to location _
whether they would hop by means of a spring-loaded motor or crawl
like a crab.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez asserts that if the concept works, it could mean that
the U.S. military no longer would have to use anti-personnel mines,
which the Army scatters around tank-killing mines to deter the
enemy from mine-clearing.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-personnel mines are triggered by a light touch, the brush
of a foot or hand. Anti-tank mines, however, are triggered by heavy
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Unexploded anti-personnel mines are a major health hazard.
According to the State Department, 110 million mines are buried in
62 nations and kill 26,000 people each year, mainly civilians.
Minefields often are difficult to detect without expert help
because they have been overgrown by weeds and their whereabouts
long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his decision not to sign an international treaty
banning anti-personnel mines, President Clinton said they are
needed to protect U.S. forces in South Korea from a numerically
superior adversary in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Another weapon DARPA is developing is the so-called micro air
vehicle, which would be less than six inches in any dimension. It
would carry sophisticated imaging sensors for night or day
operations and would be designed specifically for use in urban
warfare, as in Mogadishu, Somalia, where U.S. troops had difficulty
spotting enemy forces among civilians during a 1992-1994
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the project, DARPA scientists will have to make
significant advances in miniaturizing aircraft components. One key
goal is to develop turbojet engines that are about the size of a
shirt button. While that may be several years down the road,
Fernandez, an aerospace engineer, said DARPA plans to test fly next
year the world's smallest aircraft autopilot and guidance system _
complete with global positioning gear _ that weighs only about two
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   To put the miniaturization in perspective, the Pentagon
currently employs unmanned aerial vehicles, some of which are
20-feet long and weigh over 300 pounds, to conduct surveillance and
relay television images back to a command post. Such a weapon was
used in the Kosovo conflict, and at least one crashed.

E-TICKET WINS ACCEPTANCE AMONG FLIERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Electronic airline tickets are no longer the wave of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the delight of the U.S. airline industry, more and more
passengers are embracing paperless tickets, also known as
e-tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Several carriers, including Chicago-based United Airlines and
Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest Airlines, recently hit halfway marks
for e-ticket use, with about half of all travelers using them. The
industry is also starting to create technology that will let
carriers handle each other's e-tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The e-ticket concept is simple. As with hotels or rental cars,
airline reservations are stored in computers. Customers don't need
tickets to check in.
</P>
<P>
   The system varies by carrier, but in general, passengers need to
show up at the airport with photo identification. A few carriers,
including Houston-based Continental Airlines, Dallas-based
Southwest Airlines and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, say it's a
good idea to bring a confirmation number, but it's not required.
</P>
<P>
   ``No worry about losing anything,'' said Al Lenza, vice
president of distribution for Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, carriers' ticket agents will ask to see a credit
card if it was used to buy a ticket. For international travel, an
itinerary/receipt is typically needed.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest and Continental both offer automated check-in machines
for e-ticket customers.
</P>
<P>
   Major U.S. carriers, seeking to boost customer convenience and
save themselves money and time, began testing and introducing
e-tickets in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers cut postage costs and processing time. E-tickets save
some carriers between $1 and $3 per ticket, depending on the
airline.
</P>
<P>
   At Southwest, 13 or 14 people handle a paper ticket once it is
given to an agent, said Kevin Krone, director of marketing
automation. The paper works its way through accounting and other
processes before landing in storage.
</P>
<P>
   Continental executives say passengers were the driving force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did this for the customer,'' said Bonnie Reitz,
senior vice president of marketing and sales. ``We want to make
everything easy for the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bush Intercontinental Airport this week, several passengers
said they preferred ticketless travel. Houston resident Kristin
Elliott, flying Continental to Atlanta for business, was one.
</P>
<P>
   An e-ticket fan who travels every couple of months, Elliott
checked in and got her boarding pass from a machine. She is able to
check in quickly and doesn't have to worry about losing her ticket
before getting to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a huge line of people waiting to check in the
old-fashioned way,'' she said after checking in.
</P>
<P>
   Sheree Jones of nearby Katy, Texas, was flying Continental for a
vacation _ with a paper ticket. Her mother, though, uses e-tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother uses them all the time and she loves them. I just
haven't done it,'' Jones said. ``It's hard to teach an old dog new
tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said her mother flies more. ``Probably if I flew as
often as she does, I would go paperless,'' Jones said. ``Otherwise,
paper works fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Both airlines and travel agents have seen the popularity of
e-tickets rise.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-based Airlines Reporting Corp., a middleman between
airlines and travel agents, began tracking e-ticket sales by travel
agents in 1997. The vast majority of U.S. travel agents are part of
ARC's system.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, 6.5 percent of travel agent ticket sales were
electronic, according to ARC. Today it's 39.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of paper tickets, which are worth money, is an
antiquated form,'' said Joseph Galloway, president and chief
executive of the American Society of Travel Agents and a Houston
travel agency owner.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the tickets his agency sells are electronic. The
main advantage for travel agents, Galloway said, is lower delivery
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, United, the world's largest airline, announced that
51 percent of the more than 7 million tickets used on the airline
in May were e-tickets. In June, Northwest e-ticket usage also
exceeded 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been exceeding our expectations all along,'' said
United spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch. ``We're pleasantly surprised with
how well it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Continental and American Airlines said e-tickets represent
about 40 percent of ticket sales. If only travel that is eligible
for e-ticket use is considered, the number for each goes up to
about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only a small number of foreign travel agents are able to sell
electronic tickets.
</P>
<P>
   A key missing link in the e-ticket setup industrywide has been
that major carriers can't handle each other's e-tickets. If, for
some reason, a passenger is moved from one carrier to another, a
paper ticket is needed. Paper tickets have also been required for
travel on two different airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But that's changing. Last month, American and Canadian Airlines
announced that e-tickets could be used when itineraries include
travel on both. The two are partners and sell seats on some of each
other's flights.
</P>
<P>
   Continental said it will be able to do the same with its partner
America West in September, and with Northwest, also a partner, by
the end of next year's first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Continental also has been upgrading its e-ticket check-in
machines.
</P>
<P>
   New machines, with a sleek look and more advanced technology,
are already in Austin, Texas, and Continental's Newark, N.J., hub.
They'll go into Houston in August and be throughout Continental's
system by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cossette, Continental's vice president of distribution
planning, said the new machines have ``faster, friendlier
screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of fall, Continental will do a test, putting
machines allowing remote check-in into a few corporate buildings,
including those of Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a machine in the lobby of Continental's downtown
Houston headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   With acceptance growing as it is, Northwest's Lenza said he
could envision a fee to get paper tickets in the not-too-distant
future.

   POITIERS, France _ After almost three weeks of racing, the scene
in the Tour de France has become a familiar one: American Lance
Armstrong holds onto the yellow jersey, and the French riders are
no shows.
</P>
<P>
   Since July 3, the cyclists have ridden 19 races for a total of
2,161 miles around France, with just a time trial Saturday and
Sunday's final ride to Paris remaining. In that time, Armstrong has
worn the leader's yellow jersey for 11 straight days, and the
French have not won a stage. If they stay winless, it will mark the
first time since 1926 that French riders did not win at least one
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Italian rider Gianpaolo Mondini won Friday's stage in 4 hours 17
minutes 43 seconds, while Armstrong finished with the pack three
minutes later. He has a 6:15 lead over Spaniard Fernando Escartin,
and Armstrong didn't bother to pad it.
</P>
<P>
   The 117-mile stage of rolling hills, running from just north of
Bordeaux to Futuroscope, a modern-technology theme park, was made
for the sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   The now-traditional duel of German Erik Zabel and Australian
Stuart O'Grady materialized as they battled it out for the first
sprint of the day, 15 miles into the race. Zabel won it and still
holds the lead for points accumulated for the green jersey given to
the top sprinter that he'll win if he hangs on through Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The pack of cyclists didn't seem to mind when 13 riders took off
on the course's only climb 80 miles into the race and built up a
three-minute lead. Mondini, who is ranked 77th overall, took off
four miles away from the finish, so it wasn't mad dash to the
finish. Eight riders followed him three seconds later, with the
rest of the breakaway group coming in 14 seconds later. But most of
the riders, including Armstrong, cruised in three minutes after
that.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the relatively flat course didn't have the steep
mountain passes or twisting descents that usually attract fans, the
course was lined with spectators virtually the entire way. In
addition to the familiar signs for France's Richard Virenque,
several banners targeted countryman Thierry Bourguignon, including
one that said, ``We have beef stew.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the cyclist who is in 48th place has become known
for his daily TV appearances, in which he likes to talk about food,
and presumably, stew.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the cyclists rode through the town of Cognac, different
signs read ``Armstrong Loves Cognac,'' and ``No to EPO, Long Live
Cognac (In Moderation), referring to the illegal blood doping drug
EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who took over the yellow jersey when he won the time
trial July 11, said he thinks he can repeat the winning performance
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'll try to win it,'' he said, adding that the two
stages in the Pyrenees had left him with tired legs.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the French drought in the Tour?
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Thevent, who won the Tour in 1975 and 1977 and is now a
commentator for French TV, offered his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's still the Champs Elysees,'' he said, referring
to Sunday's finish on the main drag in Paris. Then, in dramatic
French fashion, he clasped his hands and looked up at the sky,
saying, ``I'm praying to God, I'm praying to God.''

   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Before President Jacques Chirac of France
embarked on a five-day trip to Africa, he said he would carry a
message emphasizing the importance of democratization and the rule
of law to four countries short on both.
</P>
<P>
   But midway through the trip, he has angered many Africans, who
have interpreted his comments as reaffirming a French foreign
policy stressing stability and France's economic interests
foremost.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac began by visiting two former French colonies, Guinea and
Togo, where two men have held power for a combined 47 years and
were reelected last year in disputed voting.
</P>
<P>
   In Guinea, Chirac said there was an ``African rhythm'' to
democratization that France would respect. The government of
President Lansana Conte, who seized power in 1984, has kept the
leading opposition candidate in elections last December languishing
in jail for the last seven months. The government announced,
however, on the eve of the Chirac visit that the opposition figure,
Alpha Conde, would be granted a trial in September.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was reinforced during Chirac's stop in Togo, a sliver
of a nation where President Gnassingbe Eyadema has held a tight
grip on power for 32 years, making him the longest-ruling head of
state in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Togo has been paralyzed politically since presidential elections
last summer when returns showed Eyadema trailing and one of his
generals took over the ballot counting. Since then, the West has
almost completely cut off aid to Togo; the opposition parties
boycotted parliamentary elections in March.
</P>
<P>
   During Chirac's visit to Togo, which took place as the the
government and opposition parties were holding important talks, he
criticized the opposition for having boycotted the March elections.
His remarks were welcomed by Eyadema, who said he would not run for
reelection in 2003. But they caused leaders of the main opposition
party, the Union of the Forces for Change, to back out of a meeting
with Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac also cast doubt on a recent report by Amnesty
International that depicted a deteriorating human rights picture in
Togo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably, to a large extent, an attempt at
manipulation,'' Chirac said of the report at a news conference in
Lome, the Togolese capital. He added that Eyadema had been right in
suing Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   After the London-based organization released its report in May,
the government responded by arresting an Amnesty International
worker and by barring three others, including the secretary
general, Pierre Sane, from entering through the Ghana border.
According to the report, since the presidential elections, hundreds
of political opponents have been killed by Togo's security forces,
which include the military, police and a special presidential unit.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Amnesty report caused the biggest stir, its
findings have been reflected in other investigations, including the
U.S. Department of State's human rights report on Togo for 1998.
``Security forces were responsible for extrajudicial killings,
beatings, and arbitrary arrests and detentions,'' the State
Department concluded, adding that the ``government did not, in
general, investigate or punish effectively those who committed such
abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always considered French leaders as defenders of
dictators,'' said Kokou Gawanou, a member of the Union of the
Forces for Change, reached by telephone in Lome. ``So I am not
surprised by Chirac's comments.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Eyadema's position had appeared uncertain
amid a period of political liberalization in Togo and the rest of
Africa, inspired in part by Chirac's socialist predecessor,
Francois Mitterrand. As the end of the Cold War undermined part of
the logic of propping up African dictators friendly to the West,
Mitterrand encouraged democratization by tying French aid with
progress toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, who once called multiparty democracy a ``luxury'' for
developing countries, has not picked up his predecessor's message
in his visits to Africa. During this visit, Chirac has focused on
expanding France's economic interests in Africa. Friday he arrived
in Nigeria, a former British colony with important French
investments. He is to end his trip in Cameroon.

PANEL OK'S NEW SUMMIT EYE LASER TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summit Technology Inc. has gained the approval of a government
panel to market its eye laser machine for a new vision-correction
technique called Lasik.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation _ a pivotal step that is expected to lead to
full US Food and Drug Administration approval _ prompted Summit
shares to rise 2 points Friday, to close at 20 1/2 on the Nasdaq
exchange, close to its 52-week high of 23 7/16 on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the green light from the FDA will enable Summit to
better compete against archrival Visx Inc., the Santa Clara, Calif.
manufacturer of eye lasers, which controls approximately 70 percent
of the market. On Thursday Visx gained a similar FDA panel
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Currently ophthalmologists use Visx and Summit equipment to
correct nearsightedness and eliminate the need for wearing eye
glasses or contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Each firm's equipment is licensed by the FDA for a procedure
called photorefractive keratectomy, or PRK, that cuts and reshapes
a patient's cornea. In Lasik, or laser in-situ keratomileusis,
doctors cut a thin flap across the front of the eye, fold it back,
and shape a deeper layer of the eye before replacing the flap.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, ophthalmologists say their patients see more
immediate results with less discomfort with Lasik compared to PRK,
prompting them to switch procedures. However, until this week, the
FDA did not formally approve the use of vision correction lasers
for Lasik, even though it was used 90 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   With Summit and Visx, each gaining FDA advisory panel backing
for Lasik, the FDA is essentially catching up to the changes within
the ophthalmological community, noted Stephen Sabba, director of
research at Sturza's Medical Research. Eye surgeon now can
advertise the procedure to attract patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA is codifying Lasik, which is now about 90 percent of
the procedures and providing government guidelines,'' said Sabba.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry observers said they did not expect the Lasik
approval to significantly alter the fees of $1,500 to $2,000 per
procedure that ophthalmologists charge.
</P>
<P>
   A third competitor, Sunrise Technologies International of
Fremont, Calif., saw its shares lose three-quarters of their value
today when the FDA rejected the company's eye-surgery laser system.
The FDA said the device did not show lasting benefit in enough
patients in treating mild farsightedness. Sunrise shares fell 11
9/32 to close at 3 23/32 on the Nasdaq exchange.

US MEN'S TEAM GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS VS. ARGENTINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ Friday dawned as so many days do down here: hazy,
lazy, sunny, and warm. It was a day for many things for the United
States basketball team, none involving basketball.
</P>
<P>
   As the United States celebrated its monster win Thursday over
Puerto Rico, the coach, Larry Brown, interjected briefly to remind
them of why they're all here. Going 8-0 in preliminary play was
great. Spanking Puerto Rico in front of their home fans was great,
too. But there's still unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   Saturay that business will be attended to. The US will meet
Argentina in the first of two semifinal games, the winner
guaranteeing a berth in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. The second
berth will be awarded to the winner of the other semifinal between
Puerto Rico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The two winners meet on Sunday night for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The game against Argentina pits the two hottest teams in the
tournament against one another. The US, of course, is the man among
boys down here, even though it has failed to reach 100 points on
four occasions and beat Brazil by ``only'' 17. Argentina,
meanwhile, has won five straight and has not lost since its 103-72
pasting by the Yanks a week ago. Argentina finished with the same
record as Canada and Puerto Rico, but dropped to fourth because of
the tournament's tiebreaker system.
</P>
<P>
   None of those results matter now. It's very simple. The winners
of Saturday's games go to Sydney. The losers don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably as meaningful a game as any of these guys have
ever played,'' Brown said of the Sydney clincher. ``We still gotta
show up and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tim Hardaway: ``Hopefully they (Argentina) understand that
we're on a mission, and we came here to accomplish that mission, to
go to Australia and play in the Olympics. We're looking at two
games. We don't want to lose either one. We don't want to give
nobody any ideas. We want to play as hard as we can with our minds,
our bodies, and go out there and win and show teams that we are the
best team in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrival of NBA players on the international scene in
1992, the United States has a gaudy 38-0 record. Of those 38 wins,
only nine have been by fewer than 30 points. This team, while
looking bored and tired at times, is no mood to even think about a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what we have to do (Saturday) and then you all can go
home,'' said Gary Payton. ``We're not coming out to lose. It's not
like we're going to win nine games and then lose. If we're in a
game, we're going to be competitive. We want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the US played Argentina, the game was highlighted
by a spectacular dunk by 19-year-old Andres Nocioni over Tim Duncan
and Kevin Garnett. Since that game, the Argentines blew out
Venezuela and the Dominican Republic and won close ones over Puerto
Rico and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The other semifinal has all the trappings of a tight, emotional
contest. Puerto Rico staged a dramatic rally Wednesday to defeat
Canada, 80-75, the margin just sufficient to avoid a meeting with
the United States. The rematch should be every bit as taut as the
first meeting with a boisterous crowd on hand to rally the hosts.
Puerto Rico already is talking about another shot Sunday at the
United States, but Canada has other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough for them to beat us twice in a row,''
said Canada guard Steve Nash.

<P>
   The secret to happiness, it turns out, may not be wealth or
power. Or love or success or faithful friendship. Or Ray Charles
crooning ``Georgia on My Mind'' or even chocolate mousse.
</P>
<P>
   Finding happiness may mean going no further than your very own
forehead _ the left prefrontal cortex of your brain, to be exact.
The more the sparks fly from this sliver of gray matter, the more
electrical impulses it generates, the happier you are.
</P>
<P>
   That is the conclusion of Richard J. Davidson, a professor of
psychology and psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, and others who have examined adults, children, infants,
even Rhesus monkeys. Over the last several years, they have tested
perky, enthusiastic people and pessimistic, morose ones. The
results are always the same. People blessed with effervescent left
prefrontal cortices are much more likely to be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson is part of a small band of pioneers who have set out
over the last decade to discover what many philosophers but few
scientific researchers have bothered to ask: What is it, exactly,
that makes us happy?
</P>
<P>
   They are marshaling all the most sophisticated scientific
techniques: searching for a genetic basis for happiness, brain
imaging to pinpoint the spot on the brain where happiness resides,
and in-the-field surveys to try to understand which activities or
stimuli make people more or less happy. And they are interested in
a range of possible applications. How does happiness affect
physiological symptoms like stress and heart disease? Can drugs be
used effectively to make unhappy people happy? Are our brains coded
from birth for a certain level of happiness, or can they be altered
by experiences when we are young, or even as adults?
</P>
<P>
   This is revolutionary stuff, not only for biologists but also
for psychologists, who have concentrated much of this century on
pathology, obsession, melancholy and angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look in a psychology textbook,'' said Daniel Kahneman, a
professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University
and another happiness sleuth. ``There are a lot of pages devoted to
anxiety and depression. Happiness might not even be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Norbert Schwarz, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, said it had historically been tough to get grants to
study what tickles our fancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're deciding whether to fund research,'' Schwarz said,
``it seems much more important to say you want to help people not
to get depressed than to say you want to help people enjoy their
dinner more.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, happiness research is on the upswing. Chock it
up to the Don't Sweat the Small Stuff movement, experts say, or to
the emphasis on physical health and ``wellness'' that has us
smoking less and Stairmastering more.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness, it goes without saying, is highly subjective and some
researchers are trying to better define and measure this squishy
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. Diener, a University of Illinois psychologist who
conducts happiness research, said in an interview: ``We're trying
not to just ask people how happy they are in general, but to
document it at specific points. Happiness is how frequently you're
happy, not how intensely you're happy. Having some peaks in there
is nice _ it's certainly not bad _ but if you have a peak, it could
be because you're unhappy and then you had something happen to make
you super happy. Then you have to go back to the normal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Argyle, a psychologist at Oxford University, has found
some common threads. Money, he says, makes little difference to
happiness, except for people who are very poor. People on the job
are happiest when they have good relationships with coworkers and
when part of their day is spent ``wasting time, fooling around, and
sharing gossip and jokes,'' he said. And for some reason, watching
soap operas on television makes people happy (``I think they've got
imaginary friends there,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, most happiness researchers are convinced
that a healthy part of happiness is physiological and genetic.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on twins have found that ``identical twins separated from
birth are more similar in how happy they are than fraternal twins
who grew up together,'' Diener said.
</P>
<P>
   The research of Davidson and others provides some of the most
compelling evidence yet.
</P>
<P>
   People who describe themselves as optimistic, engaged, ``the
kind of people who jump out of bed in the morning and are ready to
tackle the world,'' as he put it, have consistently higher levels
of left prefrontal lobe activity. Physiologically, they also have
``higher levels of natural antibody activity _ antigens against
everything from colds and flu to cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, people who are depressed have greater activity in
their right prefrontal lobe. And children with more active right
prefrontal lobes show ``excessive wariness in response to
unfamiliar situations,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   To see whether anticipation of something good or bad makes a
difference, Davidson tested heavy smokers who were deprived of
cigarettes for a day and then shown a lighted cigarette and told
they would be able to smoke in two minutes. During those two
minutes, the smokers showed a strong increase in left prefrontal
lobe activity.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a group of people with intense fear of making
public speeches were told they would be required to do just that.
Their right prefrontal lobes went ballistic as they got closer to
making the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, drug companies have been banging on Davidson's door.
He says that some studies have found that antidepression drugs
increase left prefrontal cortex activity, although there is no
research yet on how long the effects last.
</P>
<P>
   Yet drawing the line between the physical and the psychological
is not easy. What is cause and what is effect: are people with more
prefrontal cortex activity happier or do happier people have more
prefrontal cortex activity?
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, for example, is studying whether experiences _ like
meditation _ can produce changes in prefrontal brain activity ``to
more definitively answer the question on nature vs. nurture,'' he
said. ``Data suggest there's a lot of plasticity that appears to be
present up until the time of puberty. But brain function might be
malleable even in adults.''
</P>
<P>
   He assisted in a recent study conducted with Jon Kabat-Zinn, a
meditation expert at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center
in Worcester, in which stressed-out executives of a high-powered
biotechnology company were given an eight-week course in meditation
_ one three-hour class a week and an assignment to practice 45
minutes a day. The results are not yet in, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of the Dalai Lama, Davidson is also studying
Buddhist monks, both in Tibet and Wisconsin, to see whether their
lives of meditation show up on their prefrontal lobes. ``To get
these people to do the research is very difficult,'' he added,
``They tell us if we really want to learn about meditation they
could give us instruction, and if we like it we can teach it to
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever this research will ultimately show, happiness is
clearly more than the sum of brain circuits. Researchers have
noticed, for example, that people's responses to questions about
happiness change depending on the context in which they are asked.
If asked about their lives on a sunny day, people are likely to say
they are more content than on a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, a co-editor of ``Well-Being: Foundations of Hedonic
Psychology,'' published this month by the Russell Sage Foundation,
has conducted an experiment in which some people who used a
University of Michigan copying machine found a dime that
researchers planted, while others were not given a dime to find.
</P>
<P>
   After using the copier, people were asked how happy they were
about life, and those who found a dime were consistently more
upbeat about ``their lives as a whole, the economy, that kind of
thing,'' Schwarz said. ``We've found that a dime can make you happy
for about 20 minutes. Then your mood wears off.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness guinea pigs at the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana are given Palm Pilot handheld computers, which
beep randomly several times in a day. After each beep, subjects
fill out a questionnaire rating their happiness at that moment on a
scale of one to seven. They are also asked what they were doing
when they were beeped.
</P>
<P>
   Kahneman, another co-editor of the ``Well-Being'' book, said
research on moment-to-moment happiness could help scientists figure
out all sorts of things. ``What is the mood of people when they
ride in a Washington subway versus a New York subway?'' he asked,
making a comparison between a subway that's new, clean and punctual
and one that's often not. ``What is the effect on mood of having
trees, of looking at water?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kahneman and a colleague published a paper on whether
people are happier in California or the Midwest. ``We found not a
particle of difference,'' he said. ``But everyone in California and
the Midwest thinks that people are happier in California.''
</P>

   Kahneman concluded that people asked about happiness often focus
on one particular point, like the fact that the climate is much
better in California. But when it comes right down to it, Kahneman
said, ``climate is just not very important to well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   There do appear to be cultural differences across countries
though.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlet, it seems, was the rarest of creatures: an unhappy Dane.
Surveys have found that ``Danes appear to be frightfully happy,''
said Argyle, citing a study in which 65 percent of the Danes
interviewed said they were satisfied with life. By contrast,
``Italians and French seem miserable,'' he said, with only 10
percent giving life a thumb's up.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to be a pretty positive bunch, while Asians are
less sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Japan report being less happy _ probably because
they focus on the negative,'' said Diener, referring to several
cross-cultural surveys that have been done. ``They think about
their own shortcomings. Americans have bad points, but they don't
tend to look at them too much.''

CLINTONS EXPECTED TO VACATION ON VINEYARD FOR FIFTH SEASON

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his family are planning a
return to Martha's Vineyard for their summer vacation sometime in
mid-August, White House officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Their plans are not yet final, but officials say the Vineyard is
the most certain among the range of options the first family is
considering. The Clintons also are pondering a side-trip to
Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Martha's Vineyard has been a magnet for the president and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for all but two of their seven
summers as White House residents.
</P>
<P>
   This year's choice of the Vineyard comes somewhat as a surprise
because of intense speculation that the Clintons would vacation in
New York state, perhaps in the Adirondacks or the Hamptons, because
Mrs. Clinton is almost certain to run for the US Senate in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to both Clintons had debated whether it would appear as
a political move for them to suddenly abandon their favorite
vacation haunt in favor of New York, especially since one adviser
complained that the Adirondacks is fly-invested.
</P>
<P>
   While the dates for their vacation have not been set, they
usually arrive a few days before the president's Aug. 19 birthday
and stay for two or three weeks. This year they are considering
arriving Aug. 15 and staying for a week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, and their daughter Chelsea, are likely to stay at
the Edgartown vacation home of Boston businessman Richard Friedman,
where they have stayed four times.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Clintons' Massachusetts vacation starts next month,
it is likely to end on the weekend of Aug. 28-29. That is when the
president and Mrs. Clinton are expected in East Hampton, N.Y., for
a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser.

KENNEDY PLANE WRECKAGE ON WAY TO BASE FOR ANALYSIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Navy Friday completed its efforts to recover the twisted
fuselage, broken wings, ruined tail, and other crumpled remnants of
John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane, and government sources said roughly 90
percent of the wreckage had been salvaged.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Friday, the Navy recovery vessel USS Grasp had raised
its anchor from the crash site 7 1/2 miles off Martha's Vineyard
and had begun carting the closely guarded collection of scrap to
the Newport, R.I., Naval Base.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival in Newport, the wreckage was to be placed aboard a
flatbed truck for transport to a hangar at the Coast Guard Air
Station on Cape Cod, said Navy Lieutenant Commander Victor Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's aboard that's coming aboard,'' Beck said. ``The
Navy's work here is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting almost immediately, investigators with the National
Transportation Safety Board will begin a detailed review of the
physical evidence left by the July 16 crash that killed Kennedy,
38; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33; and her sister, Lauren
Bessette, 34.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials declined to comment Friday on their efforts,
citing a news blackout ordered by the board's chairman, James Hall,
in deference to the memorial service held in Manhattan and another
planned for Saturday night in Greenwich, Conn., for Lauren
Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on the NTSB's findings were expected to resume next
week, though the complete investigation was expected to take six to
nine months.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the investigation said the recovery
efforts were ``quite successful'' in part because the debris was
largely contained within an underwater crash site of roughly 100
square yards.
</P>
<P>
   Before the plane was found late Tuesday by the USS Grasp using a
robot search vehicle in 116 feet of water, investigators expressed
concern that significant parts of the plane might have been moved
by strong currents at the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, investigators expressed confidence they will have
enough of the plane, along with detailed radar tracking data, to
reach a conclusion about the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Massachusetts State Police officials renewed their
request that boaters and beachgoers turn in any objects they
believe might have come from Kennedy's Piper Saratoga II HP.
Failure to do so could result in criminal prosecution, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to publicly detail all the parts of the plane
found, but they confirmed that the instrument panel, the engine,
and the propeller, all of which will be key to the investigation,
were among the items recovered. The bodies of the three victims
were found in the fuselage, which was brought to the surface along
with significant parts of the tail section and wings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the state Medical Examiner's Office
Friday disputed reports that the autopsies of the three victims did
not include photographs of the bodies. Several media outlets
reported erroneously that photos were omitted in response to a
request from the Kennedy family, which feared they might eventually
end up on the Internet or in the tabloid press.

INDIAN TRUST FUND TRIAL ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer representing 300,000 American Indians told
a federal judge Friday that the Interior Department has so badly
bungled the management of trust accounts created for the benefit of
the Indians that it cannot be trusted to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only this court can ensure that the trust responsibilities are
done right,'' attorney Thaddeus Holt told U.S. District Judge Royce
C. Lamberth. Holt said the ``abysmal'' record of the Interior
Department has led to the loss of billions of dollars from the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Lamberth to appoint a special master to oversee a trust
fund overhaul and to remove management of the trusts from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, a branch of the Interior Department that
has been in charge of the funds for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department attorney Tom Clark, representing the
government, admitted that the trust fund program had hit ``bumps in
the road in the past,'' but he said the Interior Department was
``doing all that it could'' to fix the situation in a reasonable
amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   Clark argued that problems with the funds go back decades and
that the department under Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has made
progress in correcting them. Recently, the department installed a
$60 million computer system designed to improve record keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said that as long as the government was making
``reasonable progress'' toward solving the problems, it was not
guilty of breaking its trust relationship with the Indians and the
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade of slow progress might be out of compliance with the
law, but that isn't the case here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he conceded that some trust fund accounts have been
mismanaged in the past, Clark said it would be a mistake to take
responsibility for the program away from the BIA, which is
overwhelmingly staffed with Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``To start this process over again with some other agency or
company would just add years onto its completion date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' comments came in their closing arguments in a
class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of the 300,000 Indians as well
as 2,000 tribes. The suit seeks to compel the government to fix the
century-old trust fund system set up to manage money earned from
Indian-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, led by Elouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet
tribe in Montana, contend in their 1994 suit that the government
has failed to ensure that profits from the land were properly
distributed to the Indian owners. They say Indians may be owed more
than $10 billion in lost payments.
</P>
<P>
   Holt said that under the BIA, the trust fund program had become
a ``shambles,'' with no accounting system and almost no record
keeping. ``They have no idea who has been paid and who hasn't
because there are hardly any records left to check,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holt contended that Babbitt has stalled trust fund reform for
years. ``Babbitt spent seven years in office denying justice to
Indian account holders and covering up his role in this debacle,''
he said, adding that ``this trial has been the only thing that has
made the secretary move on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   With the trial over, Lamberth now must decide how much money is
owed to the Indians and whether the BIA will continue to manage the
trust accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth told the lawyers Friday that he had not decided whether
BIA should retain responsibility for the funds, which now have
deposits of $500 million, or if the accounts should be turned over
to a private firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to hear any suggestions either side might have on
what's the best course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., and
other lawmakers said that if Lamberth rules in favor of the BIA,
they may try through legislation to shift responsibility for the
trust funds to an outside accounting firm or to another government
agency
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trust funds were created in the late 19th century when it
was national policy to break up reservations and parcel out tracts
of 80 or 160 acres to individual Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the land was rich in oil, timber, minerals or
agricultural products. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, acting as a
trustee for individual Indians, negotiated the sale of oil, trees,
ore or crops, and then collected the money on behalf of the
property owners. The agency was supposed to manage this task like a
trust officer at a local bank.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1994 report conducted for the Interior Department by the
consulting firm Arthur Andersen said the BIA couldn't document $2.4
billion in tribal trust fund transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a 1998 report by Interior Department itself showed
that more than 123,000 of the 340,000 individual Indian trust fund
accounts lacked a Social Security number or taxpayer identification
number. At least 46,000 accounts were being held for Indians whose
whereabouts were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In tens of thousands of cases, trust fund documents were shoved
into unmarked boxes and stored in barns or sheds, according to the
Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that over the years, many of the documents were
lost or destroyed. One neglected warehouse in Albuquerque, N.M.,
eventually became so rat-infested that officials entering the
building in search of trust documents needed to wear protective
suits.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several billion dollars may have been lost in
undervalued and uncollected lease payments and in destroyed or lost
checks for Indian beneficiaries, the report said.

SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS DEPLOY CHANDRA TELESCOPE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The Columbia astronauts Friday deployed
NASA's Chandra X-ray Telescope, the most powerful observatory of
its kind, flawlessly accomplishing the primary objective of their
short, $2.8 billion mission.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after it drifted from the shuttle's cargo bay, the
telescope's independent propulsion system safely boosted the
observatory into its intended elliptical orbit around the Earth,
with a low point of 203 miles and a high point of 46,042 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The operations concluded as the second stage of the independent
booster separated cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chandra's power-generating solar arrays unfolded,
latched into place and began to generate electrical power, bringing
the most dynamic phase of its journey to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tickled to death,'' said Jean Olivier, NASA's deputy
Chandra project manager. ``We thought at any minute something would
happen to burst our bubble, but it hasn't yet.``
</P>
<P>
   Alan Bunner, NASA's Chandra project scientist, added, ``We're
tired, but very relieved. This is a very complex system and so to
have it go so smoothly so far is very gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center early
Friday EDT with Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a
shuttle mission, at the helm. Working in concert, Collins, pilot
Jeff Ashby, flight engineer Steve Hawley, mission specialist
Catherine ``Cady'' Coleman and French astronaut Michel Tognini
successfully prepared their 57-foot long, 43,512-pound payload for
deployment at the earliest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's 173-mile high orbit, however, was but the first step
in Chandra's long climb to its observing altitude.
</P>
<P>
   After the ride from the independent two-stage booster, an
internal propulsion system aboard the 40-foot-long, 12,900-pound
telescope was to take over. A series of five timed maneuvers by the
observatory during the next 10 days should raise Chandra into a
final orbit, with low point of 6,214 miles and a high point of
86,992 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra's unusual orbital perch will place the observatory above
the Earth's Van Allen radiation belts, which would interfere with
the telescope's observations.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument's first observations are expected in about three
weeks, but it will likely take longer for the telescope to fully
demonstrate the 10- to 1 hundred-fold improvement in the
capabilities of previous X-ray instruments. Chandra was designed to
operate for at least five years, though some astronomers believe
its lifetime could be double that.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra was developed to join the Hubble Space Telescope and the
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory in helping astronomers refine their
estimates of the age and size of the universe, as well as to
explain how stars and galaxies evolved.
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray instrument was designed to search for evidence of
``dark matter'' that theorists believe comprises much of the
cosmos, black holes, stellar explosions and galactic collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's astronauts were quickly informed Friday of each
milestone in Chandra's travels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good news. There are a lot of cheering people up here
aboard Columbia,'' said Collins as the days events concluded
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing as beautiful as Chandra trailing off on its
way to work,'' added Coleman. ``It's the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the video images transmitted back to Earth, the gold, silver
and blue of the spacecraft gleamed against the deep black of space.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's astronauts plan to turn their attention to several
small biology and physics experiments during the remainder of their
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle is scheduled to land Tuesday night in Florida.

CLINTONS EXPECTED TO VACATION ON VINEYARD FOR FIFTH SEASON

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his family are planning a
return to Martha's Vineyard for their summer vacation sometime in
mid-August, White House officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Their plans are not yet final, but officials say the Vineyard is
the most certain among the range of options the first family is
considering. The Clintons also are pondering a side-trip to
Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   Martha's Vineyard has been a magnet for the president and his
wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for all but two of their seven
summers as White House residents.
</P>
<P>
   This year's choice of the Vineyard comes somewhat as a surprise
because of intense speculation that the Clintons would vacation in
New York state, perhaps in the Adirondacks or the Hamptons, because
Mrs. Clinton is almost certain to run for the US Senate in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to both Clintons had debated whether it would appear as
a political move for them to suddenly abandon their favorite
vacation haunt in favor of New York, especially since one adviser
complained that the Adirondacks is fly-invested.
</P>
<P>
   While the dates for their vacation have not been set, they
usually arrive a few days before the president's Aug. 19 birthday
and stay for two or three weeks. This year they are considering
arriving Aug. 15 and staying for a week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons, and their daughter Chelsea, are likely to stay at
the Edgartown vacation home of Boston businessman Richard Friedman,
where they have stayed four times.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the Clintons' Massachusetts vacation starts next month,
it is likely to end on the weekend of Aug. 28-29. That is when the
president and Mrs. Clinton are expected in East Hampton, N.Y., for
a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser.

<P>
   NICE, France _ On the glittering Mediterranean coast of France,
one handy indicator of who is up and who is down is restaurant
menus.
</P>
<P>
   Versions in Arabic and Japanese have, for example, dwindled. The
latest editions are in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Riviera, that fabled stretch between St. Tropez and
Monaco, Russians are the new big spenders. Picking up where the
Arabs left off after oil prices fell, Russians are collecting
apartments and designer clothes and booking five-star hotel suites
and limousines for weeks at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry vendors, nightclub owners and chauffeurs are learning a
few words of Russian. They like the new customers, who pay by
peeling $100 bills from the wads in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Half a continent away, in Moscow, the ruble and the banks may
have verged on collapse and the life of the poor may be growing
more bitter. But such misfortunes are not visible on the Riviera,
Europe's most expensive coast, as these Russians look here for the
sun and a safe place for their fresh capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always went to the Black Sea, but it's too dangerous, with
the armed gangs there,'' said Anton Surikov, an executive from
Moscow who was checking in with his family at the Royal Riviera
Hotel in Beaulieu. ``And the service is very poor.''
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist asked for a routine imprint of his credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ``No card,'' Surikov said. ``Cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate agents said Russians were shopping for the grandest
villas on the rocky headlands of Antibes and Cap Ferrat _ the more
secluded the better.
</P>
<P>
   Word is out that the ``nouveaux Russes, nouveaux riches,'' as
the newspaper Le Monde called them, like not vodka, but champagne.
</P>
<P>
   They also like yachts. ``About 20 percent of our clients are
Russian this year,'' Mike Larsen at Silver Yachts in Cannes, a
major broker, said. ``They charter the large yachts with 10-man
crews.''
</P>
<P>
   Charter prices range from $70,000 to $200,000 a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Russians bought big yachts a few years ago,'' Larsen
added. ``But they did not realize the amount of upkeep. So they
sold them again.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-communist rich began to trickle in around 1993. Last
year, 80,000 passed time on the Cote d'Azur, according to the
regional tourist board.
</P>
<P>
   But this coast has long, glamorous echoes for Russians. The
liaison began more than a century ago when grand dukes and counts
from St. Petersburg and Moscow decamped to spend winters here. The
imperial family arrived by battleship at Villefranche. Chekhov and
Gogol came.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians provided a lot of the early veneer, along with the
English,'' Mary Blume, author of ``Cote d'Azur, Inventing the
French Riviera,'' said. At the turn of the century, Ms. Blume
added, ``the Russian nobility here behaved and spent
outrageously.''
</P>
<P>
   French waiters, who can be fiercely etiquette bound, have been
thrown by the new customers. Sometimes they want cognac before,
during and after dinner, or they want all the courses, hot and
cold, on the table at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they were, eh, shall I say rough, even rude,'' said
Magnus Oloffson, food and beverage manager at the Negresco Hotel in
Nice. ``They are fitting in a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, a Belle Epoque extravaganza, has a Russian hostess,
menus in Russian and a prized object of nostalgia, one of the two
giant Baccarat crystal chandeliers ordered by Czar Nicholas II.
This one was never delivered because of the Revolution. The other
lights up the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-Revolutionary aristocrats used to bring their own
servants. Some of today's Russians have brought bodyguards. Many
arrive by Aeroflot, which has opened a direct Moscow-Nice line in
the summer months. A good number come in private jets.
</P>
<P>
   France is far from the only European destination for Russians,
as they fan out to satisfy their curiosity after a long ban on
travel. Tour operators say the new middle classes have for the past
three years been appearing on the Costa del Sol in Spain and on the
beaches of Italy, Turkey and Cyprus. A survey in Greece showed that
even ordinary Russians were spending more than twice as much a
person as tourists from Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But the south of France appears to attract what local newspapers
call the ``Emirs of the East,'' people who have made fortunes in
the post-communist economic upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate agents and hotel managers describe their best
Russian customers as officials, financiers and industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've also had oil people from Azerbaijan and traders from
Irkutsk,'' one manager said.
</P>
<P>
   A real-estate agent in Cannes, Francois Michel, said his Russian
customers were ``not that numerous, but they have gone for the top
of the market,'' spending $5 million to $8 million for a beachfront
villa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some must be important people,'' Michel said. ``We've seen
them with bodyguards. But you don't always meet the real owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after a particularly classy seafront mansion was sold
at Antibes and private guards began to patrol the pine-shaded
$20-million compound, the press reported that the person behind the
buyer, ostensibly an offshore company, was in fact President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia. No one has confirmed that.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Kornfeld, a real-estate agent at Cap Ferrat, another
exclusive spot, worries that her clientele may be as fickle as the
Russian economy. ``Last year, we had a big wave of Russians who
rented summer villas and apartments for three months,'' Ms.
Kornfeld said, citing prices of $15,000 to $65,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In August, as Russia verged on financial meltdown, she said,
``quite a few clients had to leave in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, not many traveled to the onion-domed Russian
Orthodox cathedral in Nice, a small, beautifully kept copy of the
cathedral on Red Square. Built in 1900, the Nice cathedral was paid
for by the imperial family and other Russian nobles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is atheist,'' said Lukian Gorin, the dean, who
is 80. Dropping his voice, the priest added, ``We hear a lot of
them are mafia, coming to spend their money.''
</P>
<P>
   The nightclubs seem to be more in demand, as is the gambling
casino in Monaco. But the little princedom has reportedly turned
down some big real-estate bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monaco is stricter than France,'' said Ms. Kornfeld, who does
business there. ``They ask a client a lot of questions, about their
job, about the company they work in, about their bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Monaco authorities have became nervous since the police in Nice
arrested members of a Georgian gang two years ago on charges of
extortion and money laundering. The police in Nice have also been
investigating a group from Kazakhstan suspected of drug trafficking
and contract killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians come with cash, and cash makes people nervous,''
Larsen of Silver Yachts said. ``It's true we'd rather receive a
bank transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers argue that the Cote d'Azur is not easily shocked and
has a long tradition of digesting foreign money. After all, tales
about fortunes of dubious origin have swirled around the casinos
and private pools for decades. Dictators from Haiti, Zaire and
other places have kept houses here.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about money-laundering schemes and other dark goings-on
have at times brought the inspectors down from Paris. But the
old-timers say nothing much changes.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Ms. Blume wrote that on the Riviera ``nothing is
transparent, except the air.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the battlefield of the future, land mines will
unearth themselves and burrow elsewhere if they sense they have
been detected. Swarms of tiny flying robots, no longer than six
inches, will spot enemy tanks and relay targeting data by satellite
to commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Far from science fiction, the projects are on the drawing board
of the Pentagon's research and development think tank, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.
</P>
<P>
   Mines are a cost-effective means of denying an enemy a large
swath of a battlefield, or at the very least, forcing an opposing
army to stop its advance and shift resources to clearing mines.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the adversary overcomes a minefield by carving out a
narrow path, a process that can take hours, depending upon the size
of the minefield.
</P>
<P>
   DARPA, with a $2 billion annual budget, is at the beginning
stages of developing what scientists call a ``self-healing
minefield'' that would tie up an adversary for an even longer
period of time and make obsolete so-called anti-personnel mines,
which have claimed the lives of thousands of innocent civilians
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that a network of hundreds of technologically savvy,
tank-killing mines would be buried along an enemy's frontier. The
mines would be outfitted with sophisticated sensors and a wireless
communication system so that they could ``talk'' with one another.
</P>
<P>
   If an enemy soldier attempts to clear a path through the
minefield, the mines would relay a distress call to the others,
spring up through the ground, move to a nearby location and bury
themselves again.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, one mine would be able to tell another mine that
``something's changed'' and then ``the anti-tank mine could
reposition itself,'' said Frank Fernandez, the director of DARPA.
</P>
<P>
   A network of mines would change the dynamic of mine-clearing and
buy U.S. forces more time in the heat of battle because it ``forces
the adversary from clearing a small area to having to clear the
whole minefield,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's scientists are facing tough technical hurdles of
how exactly the mines would move from location to location _
whether they would hop by means of a spring-loaded motor or crawl
like a crab.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez asserts that if the concept works, it could mean that
the U.S. military no longer would have to use anti-personnel mines,
which the Army scatters around tank-killing mines to deter the
enemy from mine-clearing.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-personnel mines are triggered by a light touch, the brush
of a foot or hand. Anti-tank mines, however, are triggered by heavy
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Unexploded anti-personnel mines are a major health hazard.
According to the State Department, 110 million mines are buried in
62 nations and kill 26,000 people each year, mainly civilians.
Minefields often are difficult to detect without expert help
because they have been overgrown by weeds and their whereabouts
long forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his decision not to sign an international treaty
banning anti-personnel mines, President Clinton said they are
needed to protect U.S. forces in South Korea from a numerically
superior adversary in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Another weapon DARPA is developing is the so-called micro air
vehicle, which would be less than six inches in any dimension. It
would carry sophisticated imaging sensors for night or day
operations and would be designed specifically for use in urban
warfare, as in Mogadishu, Somalia, where U.S. troops had difficulty
spotting enemy forces among civilians during a 1992-1994
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the project, DARPA scientists will have to make
significant advances in miniaturizing aircraft components. One key
goal is to develop turbojet engines that are about the size of a
shirt button. While that may be several years down the road,
Fernandez, an aerospace engineer, said DARPA plans to test fly next
year the world's smallest aircraft autopilot and guidance system _
complete with global positioning gear _ that weighs only about two
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   To put the miniaturization in perspective, the Pentagon
currently employs unmanned aerial vehicles, some of which are
20-feet long and weigh over 300 pounds, to conduct surveillance and
relay television images back to a command post. Such a weapon was
used in the Kosovo conflict, and at least one crashed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   King Hassan II, who ruled Morocco for 38 years, prolonging the
life of a 300-year-old dynasty in an era when monarchies in Libya,
Egypt, Iraq and Iran fell to Socialist revolutions or the force of
militant Islam, died Friday in Rabat, Morocco. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, Crown Prince Sidi
Mohammed, the king's 36-year-old son and successor, announced on
state television. The king, who had been in fragile health since he
was hospitalized in the United States four years ago for lung
problems, had been admitted earlier in the day to the Avicenne
hospital Rabat, the capital, for an acute lung infection, according
to a statement issued by the palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I announce to the Arab and Islamic nations and to the whole
world the death of a great leader and a man of this world's great
men,'' the crown prince said in a brief message on state television
in which he asked the Moroccan people for ``calm and patience.''
Moroccan television said that his funeral would be held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies considered Hassan one of the
most Western-oriented of Arab leaders, a ruler who outmaneuvered
Islamic militants in his own country and who stood out among his
peers for his openness to rapprochement with Israel. Through the
years he acted as a go-between in Middle East diplomacy, helping to
arrange a visit to Jerusalem in 1977 by Egypt's leader, Anwar
Sadat, and, during the 1980s, meeting with the Israeli leaders
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres when other Arabs shunned them.
</P>
<P>
   A master at managing Morocco's complex quilt of ethnic and
ideological forces, he maintained a hold on power that was by turns
iron-fisted and deftly offhand. He survived half a dozen
assassination attempts and uprisings. On one occasion, he
intimidated the leader of rebel troops by looking him in the eye
and reciting the first verse of the Koran. Another time, when
pilots of his own air force attacked his Boeing 727 jetliner, the
king, himself a pilot, seized the radio and shouted, ``Stop firing,
the tyrant is dead,'' fooling the rebels into breaking off their
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The heir to the Alawite dynasty that claimed direct descent from
the Prophet Mohammed and ruled the Sharifian empire of the Western
Sahara, Hassan II was the author of Morocco's first constitution.
But he was at heart an autocrat, and democracy waxed and waned at
his pleasure. He tolerated opposition parties and a relatively free
press that could offer opinions on policy matters. But criticism of
the monarchy was forbidden and his ruthlessness in crushing
opponents was severely criticized by human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Economic and political reform proceeded steadily through his
years in power, and though the pace was slower than his critics
would have liked, said William Zartman, director of African Studies
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, many would agree that the
country was better off during the final years of his reign than it
was when he first came to power.
</P>
<P>
   His success lay in an ability to be different things to
different people. He kept Morocco's elite content with royal
patronage and instituted market-oriented reforms that improved the
lives of the urban middle class. He used his position as
``Commander of the Faithful'' to woo the rural peasantry,
quadrupled the number of mosques and constructed the world's
largest, the Great Mosque of Hassan the II.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had deep understanding from the early days of the tribal
mentality of Morocco and the importance of the throne as a unifying
force,'' said Robert H. Pelletreau, a former assistant secretary of
state for near eastern affairs, who knew the king well. ``He was a
superb student, and he could be exceedingly charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Moroccans said of Hassan that he had ``baraka,'' or
``blessedness, '' an Arabic expression for a charismatic person
blessed with divine protection. Yet, when he ascended the throne on
Feb. 26, 1961, most observers expected him to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Moulay Hassan ben Mohammed Alaoui was born on July 9, 1929, the
oldest of six children of Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef. Most of
Morocco was then a protectorate of France, except for sections
governed by Spain in the northwest and southern coast and the city
of Tangier, an international zone.
</P>
<P>
   As World War II unfolded, resistance to colonial rule grew.
After the fall of France, the Free-French forces promised
independence if Morocco would cooperate in the war against the
Axis, a promise that Paris would prove unwilling to keep.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, tension rose between the sultan and the French,
but the young prince was educated as befitted the heir of two
traditions. He attended the imperial college at Rabat, where
instruction was in Arabic and French. Later, he earned a law degree
from the University of Bordeaux and served in the French navy
aboard the battleship Jeanne d'Arc.
</P>
<P>
   But his father's agitation for Moroccan self-government
continued, and in 1953 the French forced the sultan into exile. In
1954 and 1955, as rioting and guerrilla warfare increased, Hassan's
father regained his title, and the following year Morocco won
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan worked with his father, now Mohammed V, to maintain the
monarchy's authority amid rising social discontent and the
conflicting expectations of those who had fought for Moroccan
independence. In 1957, he became the commander in chief of the
Moroccan army, which was splintered between officers who had been
loyal to the French and the former rebels. Hassan kept the military
occupied with civilian projects, and led it to victory against
rebel Berber tribesmen in the Rif mountains in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   But in the shantytowns of Rabat, Casablanca and other cities,
opposition simmered against the royal house. Though the monarchy
looked to Paris and Washington for financial support, it needed to
placate the leftist opposition. Declaring neutrality in the Cold
War, the prince made overtures to Moscow and accepted Soviet
military aid. ``As an Islamic People,'' he told the Associated
Press in 1961, ``we have the right to practice bigamy. We can wed
East and West and be faithful to both.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments caused consternation in Western capitals. So did
the reputation of the young prince, who the Western press often
portrayed as a playboy who liked gambling and was overly concerned
with his wardrobe.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   After Mohammed V died of heart failure following what was
expected to be a minor operation, Hassan, who had been named prime
minister in 1960, moved quickly to establish his rule. His
constitution, which was ratified in 1962, guaranteed freedom of the
press and of religion, and created an elected legislature. But the
new Parliament, fractured by bitter rivalries, proved ineffectual.
The new king retained the power to name the prime minister, disband
the legislature and control the army.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1960s, student agitation led to a wave of rioting and
arrests. Opposition figures fled abroad or were imprisoned; some
were executed. In 1965, Mehdi Ben Barka, a prominent nationalist
and opposition leader, was kidnapped in Paris and never seen again.
The king's right-hand man, Minister of Interior Mohammed Oufkir,
was linked to the disappearance, and there were those who thought
he had killed Ben Barka. But the case was never pressed. In June of
that year, Hassan dissolved Parliament and instituted a state of
emergency, wielding absolute power until a new constitution was
adopted in 1970. The constitution restored limited parliamentary
government, but discontent simmered amid continuing poverty and
official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On July 10, 1971, Hassan invited some 400 prominent Moroccans,
diplomats, and other guests to his seaside palace of Skhirat near
Rabat to celebrate his 42nd birthday. The festivities ended in a
burst of gunfire as more than 1,000 mutinous troops attacked the
palace, hurling grenades and spraying the grounds with small-arms
fire. Nearly 100 guests were killed, and more than 125 were
wounded. The king hid in a bathroom. When the firing died down he
re-emerged to find himself face to face with one of the rebel
commanders. Keeping eye contact, he recited the opening verse of
the Koran, and the rebel knelt and kissed his hand. Loyal troops
crushed the revolt, killing more than 150 rebels and capturing some
900 others, many of them young military cadets. A dozen
high-ranking, conservative officers were executed. Oufkir was named
minister of defense.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than 12 months later, on Aug. 16, 1972, the king
was returning from Paris aboard his private Boeing 727 when it
encountered an unscheduled escort of four Royal Moroccan Air Force
F-5 fighters. As the Boeing approached Rabat's airport, the
fighters fired on the plane, knocking out an engine and scoring
other hits. The Boeing landed safely, but the renegade pilots
continued to strafe the runway until Hassan radioed them, saying
the king had been killed. The rebels broke off the attack. Within
hours, key participants in the coup were arrested and shot.
</P>
<P>
   One of their leaders proved to be Oufkir, who apparently had
been secretly involved in the earlier attack on the palace.
According to official reports, the general committed suicide, but
his body was supposedly found with several wounds. His widow and
six children were placed under house arrest and were not released
until February 1991, in an amnesty marking the king's 30 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1970s unfolded, the king took several steps to dampen
domestic turmoil. In 1973, he put through measures to increase
Moroccan ownership and employment in companies doing business in
Morocco and also redistributed farmland owned by foreigners to
rural peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He alternated very cleverly between the kinds of reforms that
would be popular with the people and the kinds of reforms popular
with the ruling elite and in doing so was popular with both,'' said
Pelletreau.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1975, in a move that would unite Moroccans against a
common foe, Hassan reasserted his country's authority over the
Western Sahara, a region claimed by both Morocco and Mauritania but
was still officially under Spanish administration, by trucking some
350,000 civilians under army escort to the region, where they
staged a march.
</P>
<P>
   The move helped secure Morocco's claim but ignited a war with
guerrillas of the Polisario Front who had been fighting for
independence from Spain. Libya and Algeria supported the guerrillas
in their war against the Moroccan Army. In 1984, the king signed an
accord with Col. Moammar Kadhafi that ended Libyan backing for the
insurgents. Algeria, plagued by its own domestic problems, could
give them only minimal support. Militarily, Morocco eventually
triumphed, agreeing to a cease-fire with Polisario in 1991 that
left the country in control of most the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Polisario Front continues to hang on, but the United Nations
is scheduling a referendum in March to determine the course of the
future of the region's 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was adept at managing Arab-Israeli relations and liked to
say that he viewed Morocco's Jewish population, which numbers
around 8,000, as a bridge between Israelis and Arabs. During World
War II, his father, Mohammed V, had defied the Axis and protected
his country's Jewish population. In 1956, the year of Moroccan
independence, there were about 275,000 Jews in Morocco. Most were
allowed to emigrate to Israel, Europe and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   During the Arab-Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973, Hassan
contributed a nominal number of troops to support Egypt and Syria.
Nevertheless, he kept his channels open with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he was the host of a meeting of Arab leaders in Fez
where he pushed through agreement on a peace plan that called for
the creation of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital
but implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist. Although it was
rejected by Israel, the plan laid the groundwork for the king to
meet with Prime Minister Shimon Peres in 1986. When he was
criticized by Arab leaders for meeting Peres, he assailed them for
having neither the ability to make war on Israel nor the
willingness to make peace.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In September 1993, Morocco gave de facto recognition to Israel
by welcoming Yitzhak Rabin in the first official visit by an
Israeli prime minister to an Arab nation other than Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such bold gestures, he was careful to play both sides of
a conflict when necessary. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990, he sent 1,300 troops to Saudi Arabia, a gesture that pleased
the West. But he also expressed sympathy for Iraqis suffering under
U.N. sanctions and ordered members of the Moroccan royal family to
supervise the collection of supplies to ease their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite aid from the West, sporadic reform efforts, and an
estimated $2 billion a year sent home by Moroccans working abroad,
the economic situation during the 1990s remained difficult for most
of Morocco's 25 million people, two-thirds of whom are under the
age of 25. In the census of 1994, the urban population exceeded the
rural population for the first time. Unrest generally declined in
the cities, where most of the economic reforms were concentrated.
Although unemployment remained a problem and the strains of a
relatively slow pace of development continued, political freedom
gradually increased. In the early 1990s, pressure from human rights
groups reduced the number of political prisoners and reports of
incidents of torture declined.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist parties did well in the most recent election, in
1993. Another election is scheduled in November, in which the lower
house of Parliament will be directly elected for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such moves toward democracy, throughout his reign the
king remained jealous of preserving the symbols of his monarchy. He
refused, for example, to abandon the practice of having his
subjects show their fealty by kissing his hand, even though
advisers urged him to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he donned a business suit to meet with Western leaders,
or appeared in traditional white robes to preside over religious
ceremonies, the King was a leader of commanding presence, an
eloquent orator in Arabic who spoke excellent French and capable
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``His golf outings were the picture of an oriental potentate,''
recalled Pelletreau, the U.S. diplomat. ``He would be accompanied
by a vast entourage. If he wanted to sit, chairs would appear, and
his guests would be offered sherbert.''
</P>
<P>
   Through intelligence, charm and cunning, he steered an absolute
monarchy into the modern world. ``He sheltered Morocco from the
various political winds that blew across the Arab world and caused
such turmoil in other countries.'' Pelletreau said.
</P>
<P>
   The king is survived by his wife, Lalla Latifa, a commoner who
is officially described as the mother of the royal children, three
daughters and two sons, including the crown prince, Sidi Mohammed,
who is to succeed him as to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, the crown prince comes to the throne with the
reputation of a playboy. At 35, he is still single in a society the
emphasizes family ties. He was educated in France, where he
received a degree in law and studied international relations. He
speaks fluent French, Spanish and English as well as Arabic. In
recent years, he has begun to take a more active public role as
second in command of the Moroccan military and in helping to direct
government aid to the poor. Hassan sent the crown prince as his
representative to the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan in
February. With his accession to the throne, his younger brother
Mulai Rashid will become the new crown prince.

   PANCEVO, Yugoslavia _ Several thousand citizens gathered in the
rain Friday evening for a rally that displayed all the difficulties
the Yugoslav political opposition is having in its effort to oust
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In this opposition-run industrial town northeast of Belgrade,
the Yugoslav capital, the rally was small, decent, quiet, polite
and boring. Nearly 20 speakers, representing various parts of the
umbrella Alliance for Change, took their shot at Milosevic in a
rambling drone that caused little excitement in the crowd packed
into a downtown square of the town, which was badly damaged by NATO
bombing and where toxic chemicals have affected health and many
people are unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   The only request the rally made of the crowd was to come to
future demonstrations and ask their friends to come, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The political star of the Alliance, Democratic Party leader
Zoran Djindjic, was absent, abroad again as he often is. The best
speaker of the night was his deputy, Slobodan Vuksanovic, a young
politician with a slashing style, who accused the regime of fearing
elections, misusing its patriotism and stealing the nation's
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they authorities or are they thieves?'' Vuksanovic
demanded. ``They build houses in Dedinje,'' a fancy part of
Belgrade, ``and don't pay our soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most popular figure by far was the slight, ill and
fragile Dragoslav Avramovic, about 80 years old, who is revered by
Serbs for having drawn up the economic plan that finally licked
hyperinflation in January 1994. Avramovic gave a short, sober
speech, gracefully apologizing for the many that had come before,
and promising a new government that would introduce complete
democracy, freedom of speech and the press, and an open,
Western-style economy, with less taxation and fewer bureaucrats and
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years ago we were close to Austria economically, and now
we are close to Albania,'' he said. He was cheered loudly, seeming
to represent the honest, well-educated, altruistic expert that many
Yugoslavs want leading their country just now.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage is that Avramovic, a former World Bank economist,
is not much of a politician, but that is the problem, too,
especially in the face of an organized, softly authoritarian regime
like Milosevic's.
</P>
<P>
   As Vladimir Goati, a political science professor, said Friday in
an interview: ``Avramovic is too old to be dangerous to anyone in
the opposition. He couldn't stay in power very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Avramovic himself is resisting American pressure to take a
leading political role in the effort to unify the opposition, still
badly split between the Alliance and the larger, more populist
Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   And Draskovic himself is reluctant to give up much of the
spotlight. It will turn on him again Saturday when he holds his
second rally in the southern town of Nis, where some 100 army
reservists renewed demonstrations Friday for their back pay for
service in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic is more of a rabblerouser, but he, too, is walking
carefully, preaching against the dangers of ``civil war'' and
putting less emphasis on the immediate resignation of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition is divided and dispersed,'' said Jasmina
Stojanov of Radio Pancevo, the respected independent station
threatened with a new politicized demand for a $40,000 license fee
that it cannot afford. ``I don't think people can believe easily
any more in either Draskovic or Djindjic,'' who were allies in the
1996-97 protests against Milosevic but who soon split.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Draskovic's caution may be the increasingly sharp
warnings from the Yugoslav army leadership that opposition protests
that seek to overthrow the elected government of the country may be
crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, the commander of army
forces that fought in Kosovo, told state media that opposition
protests are leading to ``civil war, and the army is against it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Yugoslav army ``will give its unconditional
support to the state institutions and their legally elected
representatives, from the lowest officials to the president of the
republic.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps his most chilling comment, Pavkovic said: ``It is the
duty of the army to defend the country from its enemies, both
external and internal,'' and continued, ``The leaders of the
opposition cannot accept that power is won in elections, and they
want to win it on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the parliamentary speaker, Dragan Tomic, who was speaking
in Raska, attacked former army chief of staff Momcilo Perisic, who
came out Thursday against Milosevic, accusing him of politicizing
the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gen. Perisic is saying the same things'' as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, Tomic
said. ``When you find it in wheat, they call this chaff, and people
call it treason.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade Friday, university students threw thousands of
leaflets from downtown buildings calling for Milosevic's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resistance is the answer. There will be no other way,'' the
leaflets read. ``This is not a system. This is a disease.
Resistance!''

SEATTLE HOTEL REVEALS ACCIDENTAL TIME CAPSULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The mystery of the Panama Hotel lies beneath its
weathered lobby, at the bottom of 19 creaky wooden steps, beyond a
heavy glass door.
</P>
<P>
   In a dimly lighted basement, belongings of a generation are
frozen in time: kimonos delicately folded in a heavy trunk; worn
suitcases adorned with stickers from Yokohama and Kobe; and a 1942
copy of the North American Times newspaper with a blaring headline,
``Evacuation of Japanese due within 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an accidental time capsule, this dusty basement in
Seattle's International District.
</P>
<P>
   In random piles stacked high are household belongings left
behind 57 years ago when the United States turned against its own
citizens and shipped Japanese Americans to internment camps like
Idaho's Minidoka.
</P>
<P>
   Forced from their homes in April 1942, a few dozen Seattle
families stored their possessions in this cellar, hoping some day
to return for them.
</P>
<P>
   But many never did, and their electric cookers, gallon-sized
cans of Kikkoman soy sauce, homemade tempura baskets and stone
drums used for pounding cooked rice into mochi (rice cakes)
remained tucked away, out of sight and all but forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the basement recalls a shameful legacy in America's past.
Yet it also offers a glimpse back to a time when Seattle's bustling
Nihonmachi, or Japantown, was a vibrant commercial hub of fish
markets, tailor shops, trading companies, banks and grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle artist Jan Johnson saw both in the Panama when she
bought it in 1986 to save it from being torn down like so many
other hotels between Fourth and Seventh avenues.
</P>
<P>
   From her artist studio across the street, Johnson had been
fascinated with the Panama, a five-story workingman's hotel at 605{
S. Main St.
</P>
<P>
   With a tiled bathhouse below the hotel, the Panama attracted
thousands of immigrants who came to Seattle at the turn of the
century to work in its canneries, sawmills, railroads and farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see why this hotel became so important to the
community,'' said Marie Rose Wong, an Iowa State University
professor in Seattle to do research on hotels like the Panama.
``This was the nexus and node.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sensed it when she descended down the Panama's wooden
basement steps and clicked on a bare light bulb. Where some might
see clutter, Johnson saw history.
</P>
<P>
   She devoted the next decade to preserving the best of it and
creating an informal museum to teach schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is American history,'' said Johnson, whose own father,
son of a Scandinavian immigrant, came to Seattle in the 1930s.
``This is what you don't learn in textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Hori, former owner of the hotel, offered to clear out
the basement when he sold it to her in 1986, but Johnson phoned
museum curators instead.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the clutter came a collection of 37 trunks that went
to Los Angeles as part of the ``America's Concentration Camps''
exhibit, displayed at the Japanese American National Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The empty trunks and suitcases, many stenciled with family names
and addresses, continue to travel. A smaller exhibit showed at the
Ellis Island Immigration Museum earlier this year. Next month, the
exhibit opens at the William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   What was in the trunks tells a story of families of Japanese
ancestry who were also distinctly American: a brocade pillowcase of
Mount Rainier National Park, Aqua Velva after shave, a list of
graduation requirements from Fife High School's 1938-39 school
year, 16 American flags bundled in frayed brown paper and a March
17, 1916, Port of Seattle special-election voters pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   The normalcy was shattered in December 1941 when President
Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066.
</P>
<P>
   About 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were sent to remote
internment camps in Idaho, Arizona, California and other states.
Two-thirds were U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   With just several days notice, Seattle's Japanese community of
about 8,000 scrambled to settle their affairs and find storage for
their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Some were forced to sell their possessions and property for
pennies on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going to happen to them,'' remembered
81-year-old Hori, who was imprisoned at Minidoka from 1942 to 1945.
``We didn't even know whether we'd come back here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Even rumors of the evacuation in 1941 could not prepare families
for the horror of what was to come, said David Takami, the local
author of a book about Japanese Americans in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tumultuous time,'' he said. ``When the order came
down it was quite shocking that people would have to leave their
homes. They were able to take what they could carry and that wasn't
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   What they did not take with them, they gave away, sold or left
with friends or stashed in churches or private basements.
</P>
<P>
   Others went to Hori, whose family bought the Panama hotel and
building for $20,000 in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend asked me to keep some things,'' said Hori, a Seward
Park resident who ran the Panama with his wife for 45 years. ``Word
got around that I had storage space. `Can you store some of my
things?' they asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon his cellar was crammed with wooden model airplane kits and
ice skates, mattresses and bed linens and books and newspapers in
Japanese and English.
</P>
<P>
   Hori returned to Seattle after World War II and reclaimed the
hotel from the management company who oversaw it for his family
from 1942 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Hori tried to contact as many families as he could. But many
never made it back to this city. Some moved to the suburbs or out
of state. Still others didn't want to be reminded
</P>
<P>
   of what they lost _ by what they had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who needs a broken fishing rod?'' said Ed Suguro, a
63-year-old Nisei, or second-generation Japanese, and local
community historian. ``Later on it didn't mean that much to them.
As the years passed, they just forgot about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suguro was 6 when his family was incarcerated at Tule Lake,
Calif. He recalled how the Panama, like many hotels in Japantown,
was ``a social gathering place'' for male workers and later their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Seattle's first Japanese American architect Sabro
Ozasa, the Panama was home to itinerant workers who paid about $6 a
month for one of 94 single rooms. Today single rooms cost $150 a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Hori's father was one of them _ an Issei, or first generation
Japanese, who worked in a logging camp and brought his wife over in
1906.
</P>
<P>
   They ran the hotel and leased out the bathhouse, which had a
separate entrance at 302 Fifth Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the bathhouse where customers could also get their
clothes laundered, original signs on the wall continue to beckon
bathers to ``take off shoes here'' or ``please put used towels
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements promoting local businesses like Yesler Hardware
still hang above 15 neatly numbered lockers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the peeling ceiling paint is badly in need of repair, the
bathhouse maintains its original blue and white floor tiles and
linoleum. Steam pipes run along the wall of two saunas made of
rough marble.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson plans to keep the bathhouse the way it had been when it
closed in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   It is thought to be one of the country's last surviving Japanese
bathhouses of that era, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson plans to change very little about the basement.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, she has conducted private tours for
college students and schoolchildren, hoping that the presence of
items allows people to better connect with the meaning of Japanese
internment.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Johnson plans to open the basement to more
visitors and add a teahouse on the main floor.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the building's store fronts, the tearoom will hold old
photographs of Japantown before the war. Another room would hold
exhibits from the Japanese American community.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the hotel on a recent morning, the Panama's current
owner pointed out her restoration efforts to the hotel's former
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Hori nodded at each turn and recalled stories about specific
people and memories.
</P>
<P>
   He paused before entering the basement and said: ``I appreciate
her doing it. I wished the Japanese American community had awakened
to it sooner.''

IRELAND'S WIDESPREAD ILLITERACY SPOTLIGHTED BY U.N. REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ With its rich heritage of great writers,
Ireland has one of the highest illiteracy rates among the world's
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   According to a United Nations study of 12 developed nations
issued this month, Ireland, with a population of 3.6 million, has
500,000 adults _ or 23 percent of the adult population _ who are
functionally illiterate, that is, who cannot read a gas bill, a
letter or a newspaper, who cannot do the simplest arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Among developed countries in Europe, only Poland has a higher
rate of adult illiteracy, 42. In the United States, about 21
percent cannot read or count; in Britain, about 22; in Germany,
about 14; in Sweden, about 7.
</P>
<P>
   The figures in the report, issued by the United Nations Human
Development Program, mean that nearly one in four Irish adults is
seriously impaired, finding it difficult or impossible to find work
even in the growing economy of the Celtic Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finding that 23 percent of the people of this state are
unable to read instructions, a bill or a form, that they are
`functionally illiterate,' is almost incredible,'' said an
editorial in The Irish Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's higher than even we thought, a shocking figure'' said
Mary Maher, the director of the Adult Learning Center in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Geraghty, a handyman studying at the center, said, ``I felt
like my brain was in a cocoon,'' describing his inability to write.
``The words were there, but they wouldn't come out.''
</P>
<P>
   He is making progress in both writing and reading. ``I felt like
a second-class citizen,'' he said. ``I was ashamed. If my kids
asked me for help to spell a word, I would tell them I was busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary McMahon, a cleaner who has been studying at the center and
is now romance novels, said, ``My husband tried to help me, showing
me the letters on cigarette boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another student, Michael Ryan, a security guard, said, ``I
couldn't read anything, not even street signs.'' He said, ``I
couldn't even write my own name.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McMahon, Geraghty and Ryan are three of the 500 people being
helped to overcome illiteracy in Dublin programs, which have dozens
on waiting lists. The 500, in addition to another 5,500 in programs
elsewhere in the country, represent only a small fraction of the
people who need professional instruction, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Inez Bailey, director of the nongovernmental National Adult
Literacy Agency, said the government has for decades reflected the
general public attitude toward the problem: denial that it exists.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, she said, government funding for illiteracy
programs has increased to about $7 million, and the government has
stated that its goal is to provide $15 million. Even that, Ms.
Bailey said, would help only about 1 percent of the people who are
functionally illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the public attitude, Ms. Bailey said, ``The word
`illiterate' is not a PC word. But the problem still passes from
one generation to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal reason for the high rate in Ireland, she added, is
that in the 1950s and 1960s, with a depressed economy and large
emigration, the country did not have the money to provide remedial
reading programs for students, who could leave school legally at
age 15.
</P>
<P>
   Class sizes were large, Ms. Bailey said, one teacher to 50
pupils, and teachers had no time to devote to slow learners. Only
in 1967, she said, did Ireland offer free secondary education, as
most Western European countries had done decades earlier. Slow
learners, she said, were allowed to drift to subsistence on public
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 44 percent of the nation's illiterates are between age 40
and 65. Geraghty, now 55, left school when he was 12, expelled for
being a belligerent gang leader, he said. He altered his birth
certificate to make himself appear 18 and went to London to work on
construction sites, often sleeping in doorways and derelict houses.
Many of his fellow emigrants, he said, were also illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one fella kept going into the Ladies,'' he said of
the restroom. ``There were no illustrations on the doors.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Dublin, married and had a family. He relied on
his wife to write his name on birthday cards to his six children,
one of whom is now taking reading classes with him at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ashamed of not being able to read and write,'' he said.
``It's like a sickness. You think you're the only one that has
it.'' He now can read most of the articles in newspapers and has
begun two books on psychology. On the bulletin board of the center
is pinned a clear, grammatical, handwritten essay on the Easter
Rising of 1916, with his personally written byline at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McMahon, 47, recalled that in her youth, in a Dublin
inner-city school, ``I don't think the teachers cared whether you
learned or not. There were 56 in the class. If you were brainy,
they took an interest.''
</P>
<P>
   She has worked as a seamstress and a cleaner, but rushed to
enter a reading program two and a half years ago when she learned
it was available. A majority of the students are women, she noted,
adding, ``Men are more embarrassed. It takes away from their
image.'' She has passed her junior high school exams and has
learned to add, subtract and multiply, and is a bit nervous, like
many students around the world, about taking on fractions.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 44, said his parents were illiterate and that ``I was the
wildcat of the family. Left school at 14.'' When he worked as a
motorcycle messenger he couldn't read street signs. So he developed
a method: At the first delivery of the day, he would show the
receiver the address of the next delivery, asking where it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew O'Connell Street,'' he said of Dublin's main
thoroughfare. ``But nowhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said his three children are literate, and that one of them,
Don, 8, is helping him learn. ``We read stories about shops and how
to buy things in shops,'' he said. ``I can read parts of
newspapers. I'm still hammering at it.''

COUNTRY STAR TOURS HOUSING PROJECT WHERE HE GREW UP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KRISSAH WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Before Kenny Rogers was ``The Gambler'' or even a
country music star, he was a poor kid growing up in Houston's
housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   His first childhood memories are of life in Allen Parkway
Village, running on the roof, playing football and listening to
gospel music from revivals held nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As Rogers walked through the recently renovated projects Friday,
he said living there gave him ``street smarts'' and helped shaped
the man he would become.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a child, this is where the foundation for me and my family
was laid. It was a wonderful experience to be in a place like
this,'' Rogers said. ``It's a very real part of my history.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, one of the best-selling recording artists of all time,
has more than 100 million in total album sales. He is known for
such hits as ``Coward of the County,'' The Gambler,`` ''Lucille``
and ''Ruby`` (Don't Take your Love to Town).
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Rogers, who toured the complex near downtown
Houston with his older sister, Geraldine Rogers Houston, had not
walked through Allen Parkway Village since moving out in 1953. He
and Houston teased each other as they looked for their family's old
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting senile. Come on honey, I'll show you where we
used to live,'' Rogers said as he and his sister argued over where
their old building stood.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since the Rogers family lived there. Their
apartment building no longer exists and Allen Parkway Village has
been renamed the Historic Oaks of Allen Parkway. The new
apartments, which are empty because of the renovations, now have
air conditioning, washer and dryer connections, and a new townhome
style.
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1940s, when Rogers lived in the projects, all of the
families were white. Black and Hispanic families lived in other
city housing projects, segregated under ``separate but equal''
laws. Rogers said, despite the separation, he remembers black
children coming around to play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know the difference. When you're a kid you don't
stop to analyze black and white,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The renovations began three years ago after a 20-year political
battle between residents and the Houston Housing Authority. Some
former residents complained about the new apartment style after
taking a tour last week. Fifty of the of old-style brick apartments
that Rogers lived in were saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes progress is painful when you have fond memories of
the past. You're going to always have that conflict between
progress and tradition. It hurts me a lot that a place I lived has
been torn down. They were nice to save some of them,'' said Rogers,
who lives in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Houston and other members of Rogers' family still live in the
Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes, Rogers was still nostalgic upon returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad used to love sitting on the benches. He'd sit out there
and the old guys used to tell stories. We never locked our doors.
Our windows were open all the time. I felt very secure here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Housing Authority of the City of Houston presented Rogers
and Houston with a brick from one of the original buildings, a copy
of the floor plan for the renovated buildings and black-and-white
photos taken of Allen Parkway in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our most famous resident,'' said Lenwood Johnson,
president of the resident council of Allen Parkway Village. ``There
are a lot more famous people from here who won't even say that they
got their start in public housing.''
</P>
<P>
   After touring the complex, Rogers agreed to donate $5,000 to
start a Kenny Rogers Scholarship Fund for residents of Allen
Parkway Village who want to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reyna, director of communications for the housing
authority, said he hopes to raise an additional $50,000 and begin
administering the scholarship to high school students who graduate
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was home to me and I loved it. Any trouble started after
we lived here,'' Rogers said. ``I wish the new residents the best
of everything and all the hope in the world.''

FIRST SHUTTLE CREW COMMANDED BY A WOMAN DEPLOYS X-RAY TELESCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BETH DICKEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Astronauts on the first space shuttle
mission led by a woman checked ``telescope delivery'' off their
list of tasks only hours after liftoff Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Deploying the $1.5 billion Chandra X-ray Observatory was the top
priority of the five-day flight of the space shuttle Columbia,
which got off to a shaky start when a momentary short circuit
knocked out electronic controllers on two of the shuttle's firing
engines. Columbia also missed its orbital target by about seven
miles because of a fuel shortage.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said the two incidents were unrelated and would
not keep the crew from accomplishing its goals. They said they
would immediately begin investigating possible causes.
</P>
<P>
   Donald McMonagle, a Kennedy Space Center launch manager, said
Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a U.S.
space mission, was well trained to handle either situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Eileen Collins, I imagine this mission seemed like a
fairly mild simulation that she's been training for the last two
years,'' he said. ``There will be zero impact to our customers on
this mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The customers _ scientists based at the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. _ spent Friday
activating and checking out propulsion, power, communication,
pointing, imaging and data handling systems the telescope will use
in its five-year mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an absolutely tremendous day for science,'' Roger
Brissenden, manager of the Chandra control center, said in a news
conference. ``The most exciting part for me is the discoveries
Chandra will make that we don't yet know about.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission was barely seven hours old when the astronauts
placed the telescope in orbit. At 7:47 a.m. EDT, as Columbia passed
above the islands of Indonesia, Air Force Lt. Col. Catherine
``Cady'' Coleman activated a spring that pushed the Chandra X-ray
Observatory and its attached booster rocket out of the open shuttle
cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston, we have a good deploy,'' Collins informed NASA
Mission Control in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger, good deploy,'' Robert Curbeam answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chandra's on its way to open the eyes of X-ray astronomy to
the world,'' Collins said. Then she maneuvered Columbia to a safe
distance about 35 miles away while an internal timer ticked off the
minutes to booster ignition.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after Chandra's release, the Boeing two-stage
Inertial Upper Stage booster fired to push the telescope into a
higher orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra is designed to bring previously invisible emanations
from some of the most violent and mysterious events in the universe
into clear focus from a vantage point one-third of the way to the
moon. The booster fired twice, as planned, then separated from the
telescope, which will use its own thrusters to settle into its
ultimate orbit over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra joins the Hubble Space Telescope and the Compton Gamma
Ray Observatory as the third in a series of four major astronomical
instruments with which NASA hopes to paint a comprehensive portrait
of the universe. The fourth instrument is the Space Infrared
Telescope Facility, scheduled for launch in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To reach its target altitude of 175 miles for the telescope
release, Columbia needed an unexpected boost from its maneuvering
jets. McMonagle blamed a small fuel shortage for causing the
shuttle's main engines to cut off one second earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage amounted to 4,000 pounds of liquid oxygen out of
1.2 million pounds consumed during the climb to orbit. McMonagle
said shuttle fueling procedures would be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Cockpit indicators alerted Collins to the other problem, a short
circuit that she reported about five seconds after Columbia left
its seaside launching pad in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle was able to continue its ascent because its third
engine was not affected by the mysterious glitch, and because
backup controllers in the two affected engines switched on
immediately.

GLOBAL FOOD FIGHTS: THE WORST ARE YET TO COME  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ Farmers in Vermont know what they don't like:
mud season, summer tourists who hang around the town green too long
after buying their maple syrup, and agricultural imports from
Canada. Now add one more to the list: the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a sometimes raucous meeting in a chapel here
within view of Lake Champlain, they implored a team of American
negotiators to keep the WTO rom running their lives from the shores
of Lake Geneva. ``The WTO is a farce,'' said Susanna Jones, an
organic farmer and political activist here. ``It was created as a
shield to protect corporate profits around the world. Why do we put
up with a central organization that can tell us how we can farm and
what we can eat?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question, and Ms. Jones is not the only one asking it.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in Europe are screaming about the WTO, too, but for
different reasons. While American farmers view the rule-setting
group as a kind of mysterious and unaccountable body issuing edicts
from Switzerland, Europeans think it is just a tool of the United
States. How else to explain the WTO's rulings that Europeans must
drop rules against genetically modified farm products from America,
or face sanctions?
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the view is different still. From the inside, the WTO
looks like a disorganized disaster, so plagued by infighting that
it took months to agree on the next director-general to run the
place. In the end, they struck a compromise last week that left
everyone unsatisfied: having each of the top two candidates serve
for half the six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In short, five years after its creation, the WTO is making
everyone unhappy _ probably just what you would expect from the
first international body charged with dragging entrenched interests
around the world into a global trading system that operates by
global rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, farmers haven't had to worry much about those
rules. Farm subsidies and import restrictions on agricultural goods
have usually been too hot politically for negotiators to handle.
But now they will be the main subject of the next big round of
global trade negotiations, which begins later this year in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And you can hear the screaming from Osaka and Oshkosh and
Orleans. Farmers, already smarting from record low prices for
soybeans and corn and apples, are fearful that the all-powerful WTO
(``Would you like to see our black helicopters?'' one official of
the organization asks, mocking the conspiracy theorists) will force
changes they have long resisted.
</P>
<P>
   So the Japanese are trying to torpedo the talks before they
start, saying they won't give an inch on rice or other products
crucial to their ``food security.'' The Europeans say that, for the
health of their residents, anything genetically modified will be
banned. France's farm minister undiplomatically noted last week
that the United States had the ``worst food in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all those unhappy American farmers, who
cannot agree among themselves precisely what the United States
should be trying to get out of these negotiations. Certainly not
freer trade with Canada, milk and dairy farmers told August
Schumacher, undersecretary of Agriculture, because the United
States would be the loser.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's organic farmers sound a lot like the Europeans. They,
too, rail against genetically modified products, and a few
activists demanded that the corporate charters of companies like
Monsanto be revoked.
</P>
<P>
   Big corporate farmers _ who are also big political contributors
_ want the global rules written to allow them the widest latitude
possible in using genetically modified seeds, which will soon
account for two-thirds of America's soybeans and half its corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to give people around the world the choice of what
kind of agricultural products they want to buy,'' said Peter Scher,
who runs the negotiations for the United States Trade
Representative's office.
</P>
<P>
   But what Washington calls choice, the Europeans and Vermonters
call dangerous arrogance. Right now they are fighting over what
kind of labels go on the American goods, because the Europeans know
that a big, easy-to-read ``GM'' for genetically modified will
assure that the American goods rot on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   A result is that the superpowers are about to clash over
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of battle that sounds technical, but quickly pits
powerful political forces on several continents against one
another. After all, the battles over bananas and beef have already
risen to the presidential level several times.
</P>
<P>
   As elections near, both in the United States and abroad,
protectionist sentiment is bound to turn small food fights into
bigger ones. And for all its talk about the benefits of global
trading rules, it is still unclear that Washington will be able to
convince farmers here that the WTO is less threatening than a
carload of leaf-peeping tourists with New York plates.

 A burial at sea made perfect sense  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Rhonda Chriss Lokeman  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   His old man had spoken often of the sea.
And so to the sea went the young man, ashen and blessed, in the
company of his beautiful young wife and her sister. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scattered to the winds from the deck of a U.S. naval vessel, the
remains of John F. Kennedy Jr. and the sisters Bessette went to
their watery grave. Their grief-stricken families once more were
made by circumstance to meet tragedy with grace, poise and an
unnatural stoicism that has become part of the Kennedy lore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was what young John wanted, it was said: to be wind swept
after death off the shores of Martha's Vineyard, near the
Massachusetts estate bequeathed to him and sister Caroline by their
widowed mother. To be sown over the waves near where he kayaked and
set sail with cousins for competitive boat races near Hyannis
Port. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A burial at sea. Yes, of course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier talk of a possible waiver for burial at Arlington
National Cemetery, the shrine where his president-father's grave is
marked with an eternal flame, was pure speculation on the part of
know-nothings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would he be permitted to join his father at the national shrine
where burial space for those who had served in the armed services,
which young John had not, was in short supply? Would the prominent
Democratic family exercise its clout and call upon the Clinton
administration for a special favor for young John? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long ago John Jr. had made known to his family how he wanted to
be put to rest, it was said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A burial at sea. It made perfect sense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A burial at sea also meant no visitation, no lingering by
well-intended strangers such as those who in the days before the
search-and-rescue mission turned to search-and-recovery, had camped
outside his New York residence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such a burial meant no one would bother him, his wife and her
sister in their final resting place, the majestic Atlantic. Few
could visit a grave that shifted with the tide, that failed to
resist the lunar pull, that, like the waters themselves, seemed to
ebb and flow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was a man who, despite being passed the torch of princely
prominence, guarded his privacy and even more fiercely his wife's.
Even so, the couple was hounded by paparazzi. He once remarked that
he felt more like Princess Di than John Quincy Adams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A burial at sea. Yes, indeed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Young John couldn't have known then, when the lawyer-publisher
made this conscious choice, that he would be returned to the depths
from which his body, and the bodies of his wife and sister-in-law
would be pulled. The first sign of disaster were personal
possessions that washed ashore: Lauren Bessette's calling card. A
prescription medicine bottle said to belong to Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that the single-engine plane John Jr. piloted
veered suddenly and awkwardly to the right, away from his vineyard
destination, and took a merciless nosedive into Neptune's nocturnal
embrace some 116 feet underwater. Mercifully, all died instantly
and on impact, said the coroner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His father was known as the hero of PT-109, the patrol-torpedo
boat that he commanded in the Pacific during World War II. From
this sinking vessel the old man, who later would become America's
35th president, is said to have rescued several crewmen. The old
man knew water's promise and peril. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He had said in 1962 at a dinner in honor of the America's Cup
yacht race: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know why it is that all of us are so committed
to the seaI think it's because we all came from the sea. And it is
an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the
exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the
ocean. And therefore we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in
our tears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We are tied to the ocean and when we go back to the sea _
whether it is to sail or to watch it _ we are going back from
whence we came.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back whence he came, this son of John and Jacqueline. Back
whence he came, this son of the old man who loved the sea and who
in his lifetime became quite fond of it himself. &QL;

IS ANYONE LISTENING TO GREENSPAN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN WINN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They warned us in economics class that there would be days like
this. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Washington, the professors would say, is its
habit of making big changes in fiscal policy at exactly the wrong
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rather than smoothing out the waves and dips of the economy,
presidents and members of Congress frequently magnify them through
ignorance and miscalculation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Class was in session again Thursday on Capitol Hill, with a
familiar professor at the lectern. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, pointing to the obvious
hazards of an overheating economy and irrational euphoria on the
stock market, warned congressional Republicans that the big tax
cuts they want might well pour gasoline on the economic fire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is not right,'' Greenspan said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was not a lecture that House members wanted to hear. A few
hours later, ignoring Greenspan's plea, they approved a $792
billion tax-cut plan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people have been ignoring Greenspan lately, which is
not a smart idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has been flashing a yellow light at stock market investors
for so long, for example, that many of them have forgotten that he
also has a bright red one at his disposal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, chosen by President Reagan to head the Federal
Reserve 12 years ago, did not build his career by opposing
Republican tax-cut plans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this week he made two persuasive arguments against them
right now: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington has yet to produce its much celebrated ``surplus.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This inconvenient fact has been obscured by Democrats and
Republicans alike in Washington. That's because both sides want to
spend more money and offer at least some tax cuts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The surplus is not an accomplished fact; it is only a
/{projected/} surplus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The projections are based on the assumption that lawmakers and
presidents will be able to make large, unspecified spending cuts in
the future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders and President Clinton know that such cuts
are highly unlikely, although they are reluctant to discuss this
much in public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are already having trouble meeting today's
spending caps, which are not as stringent as the ones that will
have to be met later. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A common ruse to get around the spending limits, for example, is
for lawmakers to classify certain routine expenses are
``emergencies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This makes for some hilarious hypocrisy. This week's
``emergency,'' for example, was the federal census _ a regularly
scheduled and constitutionally required event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans used this preposterous argument to excuse
themselves from making the sorts of spending cuts they will need to
produce the promised federal surpluses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan gently suggested that members of Congress should
actually make a dent in the federal debt before they start figuring
out how to use all the extra money they claim to have produced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we know we really have got it locked in place,''
Greenspan said, and ``if we are not being confronted with a large
number of spending programs, which try to eat up the surplus, I
think at that point we can basically focus on getting important tax
cuts in place.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that's a big ``if.'' Both Clinton and members of Congress
from both parties have been talking this summer primarily about
spending /{more,/} not less. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts would stimulate an economy that may already be
overheating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that sizable tax cuts could make his job of
holding inflation in check and keeping the economy on an even keel
even more difficult than it already is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there will be times in the future, he pointed out, when the
economy will weaken dangerously. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At that point, he said, the economy may really need ``a
significant tax cut'' to avoid a recession. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The business cycle is not dead,'' Greenspan noted _ another
warning that the irrationally exuberant, on Wall Street or on
Capitol Hill, will ignore at their peril. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This kind of talk obviously struck many House Republicans _
along with a few giddy Democrats like Rep. Pat Danner of Missouri,
who voted for the GOP tax bill on Thursday _ as the handwringing of
a relentless worry-wart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, in fact, were downright angry at Greenspan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here they were trying to score political points for the next
election, and their man at the Federal Reserve had to speak up
about what he thinks would be best for the country and the
economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How inconvenient. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   King Hassan II, who ruled Morocco for 38 years, prolonging the
life of a 300-year-old dynasty in an era when monarchies in Libya,
Egypt, Iraq and Iran fell to Socialist revolutions or the force of
militant Islam, died Friday in Rabat, Morocco. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, Crown Prince Sidi
Mohammed, the king's 36-year-old son and successor, announced on
state television. The king, who had been in fragile health since he
was hospitalized in the United States four years ago for lung
problems, had been admitted earlier in the day to the Avicenne
hospital in Rabat, the capital, for an acute lung infection,
according to a statement issued by the palace.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies considered Hassan one of the
most Western-oriented of Arab leaders. Through the years he acted
as a go-between in Middle East diplomacy, helping to arrange a
visit to Jerusalem in 1977 by Egypt's leader, Anwar Sadat, and,
during the 1980s, meeting with the Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin
and Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   He survived half a dozen assassination attempts and uprisings.
On one occasion, he intimidated the leader of rebel troops by
looking him in the eye and reciting the first verse of the Koran.
Another time, when pilots of his own air force attacked his Boeing
727 jetliner, the king, himself a pilot, seized the radio and
shouted, ``Stop firing, the tyrant is dead,'' fooling the rebels
into breaking off their attack.
</P>
<P>
   The heir to the Alawite dynasty that claimed direct descent from
the Prophet Mohammed, Hassan was the author of Morocco's first
constitution. But he was at heart an autocrat. He tolerated
opposition parties and a relatively free press that could offer
opinions on policy matters. But criticism of the monarchy was
forbidden, and his ruthlessness in crushing opponents was severely
criticized by human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   His success lay in an ability to be different things to
different people. He kept Morocco's elite content with royal
patronage and instituted market-oriented reforms that improved the
lives of the urban middle class. He used his position as
``Commander of the Faithful'' to woo the rural peasantry,
quadrupled the number of mosques and constructed the world's
largest, the Great Mosque of Hassan the II.
</P>
<P>
   Moroccans said of Hassan that he had ``baraka,'' or
``blessedness, '' an Arabic expression for a charismatic person
blessed with divine protection. Yet, when he ascended the throne on
Feb. 26, 1961, most observers expected him to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Moulay Hassan ben Mohammed Alaoui was born on July 9, 1929, the
oldest of six children of Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef. Most of
Morocco was then a protectorate of France.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, tension rose between the sultan and the
French. The young prince attended the imperial college at Rabat.
Later, he earned a law degree from the University of Bordeaux and
served in the French navy.
</P>
<P>
   But his father's agitation for Moroccan self-government
continued, and in 1953 the French forced the sultan into exile. In
1954 and 1955, Hassan's father regained his title, and the
following year Morocco won independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan worked with his father, now Mohammed V, to maintain the
monarchy's authority. In 1957, he became the commander in chief of
the Moroccan army. Hassan kept the military occupied with civilian
projects, and led it to victory against rebel Berber tribesmen in
the Rif mountains in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   But in the shantytowns of Rabat, Casablanca and other cities,
opposition simmered against the royal house. Though the monarchy
looked to Paris and Washington for financial support, it needed to
placate the leftist opposition. Declaring neutrality in the Cold
War, the prince made overtures to Moscow and accepted Soviet
military aid. ``As an Islamic people,'' he told the Associated
Press in 1961, ``we have the right to practice bigamy. We can wed
East and West and be faithful to both.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments caused consternation in Western capitals. So did
the reputation of the young prince, who the Western press often
portrayed as a playboy who liked gambling and was overly concerned
with his wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   After the death of Mohammed V, Hassan, who had been named prime
minister in 1960, moved quickly to establish his rule. His
constitution, which was ratified in 1962, guaranteed freedom of the
press and of religion, and created an elected legislature. But the
new Parliament, fractured by bitter rivalries, proved ineffectual.
The new king retained the power to name the prime minister, disband
the legislature and control the army.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1970s unfolded, the king took several steps to dampen
domestic turmoil. In 1973, he put through measures to increase
Moroccan ownership and employment in companies doing business in
Morocco and also redistributed farmland owned by foreigners to
rural peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He alternated very cleverly between the kinds of reforms that
would be popular with the people and the kinds of reforms popular
with the ruling elite and in doing so was popular with both,'' said
Robert H. Pelletreau, a former assistant secretary of state for
near eastern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was adept at managing Arab-Israeli relations and liked to
say that he viewed Morocco's Jewish population, which numbers
around 8,000, as a bridge between Israelis and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   During the Arab-Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973, Hassan
contributed a nominal number of troops to support Egypt and Syria.
Nevertheless, he kept his channels open with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he was the host of a meeting of Arab leaders in Fez
where he pushed through agreement on a peace plan that called for
the creation of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital
but implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist. Although it was
rejected by Israel, the plan laid the groundwork for the king to
meet with Prime Minister Shimon Peres in 1986. When he was
criticized by Arab leaders for meeting Peres, he assailed them for
having neither the ability to make war on Israel nor the
willingness to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1993, Morocco gave de facto recognition to Israel
by welcoming Yitzhak Rabin in the first official visit by an
Israeli prime minister to an Arab nation other than Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The king is survived by his wife, Lalla Latifa, three daughters
and two sons, including the crown prince, Sidi Mohammed, who is to
succeed him as to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, the crown prince comes to the throne with the
reputation of a playboy. At 35, he is still single in a society the
emphasizes family ties. He was educated in France, where he
received a degree in law and studied international relations. He
speaks fluent French, Spanish and English as well as Arabic.

MEXICANS FAULT WESTERN UNION AND MONEYGRAM FOR HIGH FEES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: India, Spain, Canada, Philippines, Argentina, Ill., Colo.)   By RICK WILLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Like millions of Mexicans, Miriam Sagaon Rojas
worked for a time as a factory laborer in the United States to earn
dollars when things were hard back home. Like millions of Mexicans,
she dutifully sent some of her earnings back to her parents, using
a Western Union wire transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The money arrived quickly and safely. But Ms. Sagaon, 20, did
not realize until she returned home that Western Union had taken a
big chunk of her money for its services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until I got back to Mexico did I find out how expensive it
is,'' Ms. Sagaon said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the estimated 6 million Mexicans who live and work in
the United States send money to Mexico. But as the cross-border
wire transfer business has boomed, it has led to complaints from
customers who believe they pay too much to deliver cash to needy
relatives at home.
</P>
<P>
   The two dominant companies in the business, Western Union
Financial Services, a unit of the First Data Corp. of Atlanta, and
Moneygram Payment Systems Inc. of Englewood, Colo., have paid
costly settlements in class-action lawsuits that accused them of
profiteering by changing customers' dollars into Mexican pesos at
artificially low rates and failing to tell them about it.
</P>
<P>
   At Western Union in particular, some former employees say,
internal debates about its wire transfer rates in recent years have
contributed to a high turnover of executives of Hispanic origin in
the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, Western Union and a California-based
subsidiary, Orlandi Valuta, dismissed two high-level Hispanic
executives in the United States and two in Mexico. Two other senior
executives in the United States resigned. All said they had aired
strong differences with the company over its rates for wire
transfers to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Western Union denies any executives were dismissed because of
their views on company practices.
</P>
<P>
   Remittances are the lifeblood of many Mexican communities, where
money sent from abroad keeps children in school, pays rent and
builds homes. The amounts are growing each year. Mexico's central
bank has estimated that more than $6 billion was sent to Mexico
from the United States in 1998, the third-biggest source of foreign
revenue after oil and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Mail in Mexico is often tampered with or lost, and banks charge
high commissions to cash checks, so demand for the services
provided by Western Union and Moneygram is high.
</P>
<P>
   The currency exchange rate used by money transfer services
reflects the power they have to dictate what the customer
ultimately pays. Western Union exchanges customer dollars at only
90 percent of the benchmark exchange rate set by the central bank,
sometimes less.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the U.S. Congress shows Western Union gives better
exchange rates in countries where customers have a wider range of
options, including India, Spain, Canada and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the exchange rate premium, Western Union charges
a transfer fee ranging from $12 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   Although fees have fallen recently in response to litigation,
sending $100 to Mexico can still cost about $25.
</P>
<P>
   Several Hispanic executives who had problems with Western Union
said they believed these fees were unfair to Mexican immigrants in
the United States who had limited resources and little financial
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Western Union has become its own worst enemy simply because it
is so greedy,'' said Alejandro Urtiz, who was director of Hispanic
development at Western Union when he was dismissed in January.
Urtiz said Western Union had accused him of trying to establish a
competing electronic transfer company. He denied the accusation and
said he believed he was dismissed because he opposed the company's
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Videgain was dismissed in December as director of sales
for Orlandi Valuta. He said he had made known his anger at ads in
which the company purported to send money to Mexico free after
Hurricane Pauline devastated Mexico's Pacific coast in October
1997. In fact, he said, the company was charging by giving an
unfavorable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, I felt the company's arrogance toward
Latinos,'' said Videgain, an Argentine who has lived in the United
States for 25 years. He said he believed he was dismissed for
speaking out against the company's exchange rate at a Western Union
convention in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Elias Mercado, who arranged the company's joint venture with the
Elektra appliance stores in Mexico in 1994, was dismissed as head
of Mexico operations two years later. According to court records in
Mexico, he had written a report stating that the company should
offer a more equitable exchange rate or donate money to community
organizations. He won a wrongful dismissal lawsuit in Mexico and
was rehired and assigned to work in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado, Western Union's only senior Hispanic executive,
declined to comment on his case.
</P>
<P>
   Doug McNary, the chairman of Western Union, said he could not
discuss individual cases because it would violate company policy.
But he said the company had no problem with Hispanic executives and
that ``no one has ever been dismissed from this company for stating
their opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ziverts, a Western Union spokesman, said the prices
charged for transfers to Mexico reflected the quality of the
service, which includes toll-free operators and delivery of cash in
15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Western Union's prices have been coming down, which
critics call a result of legal pressure. A class-action lawsuit
against Western Union and Moneygram accused the companies of
failing to disclose exchange rates. When the lawsuit was settled in
May in U.S. District Court in Chicago, Western Union agreed to pay
$2 million to Hispanic community organizations, and Moneygram
agreed to pay $300,000. The settlement also included $375 million
in discount coupons available to anyone who had wired money to
Mexico since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers who represented Mexican-American communities said
they were frustrated with the Illinois settlement because it barred
further suits against the companies on the same grounds and the
discount coupons provided more business to the companies.

NONSENSICAL'

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 
McCAIN CALLS BUSH'S `COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATIVE' DESCRIPTION `A BITBy JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, a Republican presidential
candidate, dismissed Gov. George W. Bush's ``compassionate
conservative'' mantra Friday, calling it a diversionary tactic to
avoid discussing substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
   The alliterative phrase used by the GOP presidential
front-runner is ``a bit nonsensical,'' McCain said, disputing
assertions that conservative Republicans are not compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   During a breakfast meeting with reporters, the Arizona senator
also cast himself as a fan of NASA and said he would like to see
the space agency send an astronaut to Mars and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my highest priority'' for NASA if elected
president, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a broad range of questions, McCain continually
hammered on the need to revamp the nation's tax code, the military
and education. And the key to making those changes, he said, is to
reform campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want really to make those reforms necessary to bring us
into the 21st century, obviously a major aspect of that is to do
away with the influence ... of big money in American politics,'' he
said. ``The system has become so broken that the special interests
now override the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is co-sponsor of legislation to ban unregulated
contributions _ so-called ``soft money'' _ from unions and
corporations that political parties can use to indirectly help
candidates who must comply with fund-raising limits. The bill has
been stalled by the Republican leadership, which only this week
agreed to allow debate on the measure sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   McCain scoffed at suggestions that Bush and his record-breaking
$37.3 million campaign fund make his nomination inevitable.
``There's not been a coronation in the history of the Republican
Party, and there will not be one this time,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Bush describing himself as a ``compassionate
conservative,'' McCain said the characterization ``is a bit
nonsensical,'' redundant and a diversion. ``I believe conservatives
are compassionate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kind of Talmudic discussion (about compassionate
conservatism) really diverts us from what our specific proposals
and ideas are, our vision for the future,'' McCain said. ``It's
legitimate, but we should move on to other more important things.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's criticism comes one day after Bush, known outside Texas
more for his fund-raising prowess than any detailed discussion of
issues, proposed spending $8 billion in taxpayer funds to support
neighborhood groups and church groups that provide services for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday about this week's 30th anniversary of the Apollo
lunar mission, McCain called it ``one of the really signal events''
in history because ``the emotional, spiritual, uplifting effect it
had on Americans'' in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee, said a similar effort should be made to
reach Mars. ``I could support something reasonable as far as Mars
is concerned,'' he said, adding: ``But not at any expense.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain tempered his praise of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration with concerns about space agency officials'
inability to stay within budget. ``They have the greatest history
of cost overruns,'' he said. ``They make (Pentagon development of)
the F-22 look like an exercise in frugality.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a third generation Naval Academy graduate, criticized
congressional colleagues for not approving higher military pay. He
cited reports that more than 10,000 military personnel are
receiving Food Stamps. ``It's disgraceful,'' the former Navy
fighter pilot said.
</P>
<P>
   The third-term senator defended his decision not to participate
in the Aug. 14 straw poll sponsored by the Iowa Republican Party,
an early test of candidates' organizational strength in the state
that holds the nation's first presidential caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that his ``base of support is weak'' in Iowa,
McCain said he has adopted a military strategy there. ``You don't
fight on ground that's not favorable to you,'' he said, adding:
``I'm not writing off Iowa at this time. It would be foolish to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McCain is focusing on New Hampshire, which holds the
nation's first primary a week before the Iowa caucuses in February
2000, and in South Carolina, which holds its primary election in
late February.

   What Business Was That You Said You Were In? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to one's knitting is the theme of the moment in the
executive suites of many a large corporation, though it's usually
dressed up with the fancier name of ``core competencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the wonderful world of pink-sheet companies, little
outfits with publicly, but very thinly, traded stocks well below
the radar of most investors and analysts. Sometimes these companies
make spectacular leaps from one unrelated business to another in
their quest for Wall Street's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Uniprime Capital Acceptance of Las Vegas, Nev. Before
last week, Uniprime appeared to be in the car business; it owns two
dealerships and has said it plans to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the credulity-straining announcement that a Spanish
doctor working in Portugal for an obscure Uniprime subsidiary had
come up with, of all things, an herbs-and-vitamins cure for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Enough investors apparently took this claim at face value to
send the stock rocketing Tuesday on a huge spike in volume. A day
later, Uniprime was backpedaling on the robustness of its research
results, and the stock was sinking back to earth; on Thursday the
Securities and Exchange Commission halted trading for two weeks to
sort it all out. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cashing In on Geography &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When China.com, the Hong Kong-based Internet company, went
public two weeks ago and saw its market capitalization zoom to
nearly $1 billion, eyes lit up at Mail.com in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mail.com's main business is providing e-mail services, but it
also happens to own the rights to a roster of easy-to-remember
geographically based Internet domain names, like Asia.com, USA.com,
Europe.com and India.com. So the company hired Salomon Smith
Barney, the New York investment bank, to help it find partners to
develop them into information-based Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to start with the domain name,'' said Gerald
Gorman, the chief executive of Mail.com. ``We're the only company
in the world that has these beachfront properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hot properties, now used only for e-mail addresses, will
probably not be sold outright, Gorman said. Instead, Mail.com wants
to use them in joint ventures with Web site developers. ``We're
looking for a synergistic scenario where these become sites in
their own right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited as a model the relationships his company has with CNET
and a General Electric unit, NBC, and a GE affiliate, Snap.com.
Mail.com manages their e-mail functions and gets a cut of ad
revenue from the sites. &QL;

ALTERNATIVE SPIRITUALITY SPILLS INTO MEDIA AS INSTITUTIONS GET
WEAK  
 SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY  
 TEENAGERS AND ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At times during the past year, people practicing spiritual ideas
that fall outside the mainstream of major faiths have made news
largely because of their beliefs. Examples include the Wiccans in
Massachusetts, modern-day witches who protested a political
commercial they considered insulting in last fall's governor's race
there, and the small, similar group on a military base in Texas who
touched off debate this spring after reports that they were
practicing nature-centered rituals in their off-hours.
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents raise a question. At a time of growing religious
pluralism in the United States, have esoteric forms of spirituality
ever been so public and available? That was asked of Richard
Smoley, co-author of ``Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner
Traditions'' (Penguin/Arkana), a new wide-ranging book about
alternative spiritual paths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's true for modern times,'' Smoley replied, taking
the long view. ``And the reason for it is really simple.
Ecclesiastical, institutional religion is weaker in the United
States and Europe than it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Western society largely lacks authorities who
can keep certain spiritual ideas in check and discourage people
from experimenting with them.
</P>
<P>
   Smoley was editor of Gnosis, a quarterly magazine based in San
Francisco that explored subjects like Islamic mysticism and the
ideas of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, the 19th-century emigre who
launched a movement called Theosophy. (The former publisher of
Gnosis, Jay Kinney, is the co-author of ``Hidden Wisdom.'')
</P>
<P>
   While at Gnosis, which ceased publication recently, Smoley said
he saw three trends come one after another in this decade. First,
he said, there was a general interest in the spiritual implications
of the ``recovery movement'' _ the so-called 12-step groups that
advocate getting in touch with God or a higher power as a step in
overcoming addictions. In the mid-1990s, public interest turned to
the subject of angels, and more recently, he said, to cabala, a
form of Jewish mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   One underlying trend he said he expected to continue was an
interest in higher consciousness, a belief that ``the human makeup
is considerably higher and deeper than we know about or have access
to.''
</P>
<P>
   SORRY ABOUT YESTERDAY
</P>
<P>
   A different trend in the 1990s has been the decisions of some
religious groups to apologize for members' actions in the past. The
Southern Baptist Convention, for example, offered an apology to
African-Americans in 1995 for many Southern Baptists' support of
slavery and racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of European and American Christians arrived
in Jerusalem, on the 900th anniversary of the First Crusade, to
apologize to Jewish, Muslim and Eastern Orthodox Christian
representatives for the crusaders' brutality against members of
those faiths. According to Religion News Service, the event
followed a journey by several hundred people, re-tracing the
crusaders' route through Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Such events may be unusual, but one ethicist said an apology for
the past should be distinguished from the biblical concept of
repentance, which involves a declaration before God and others that
one will turn away from one's present sinful conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that apology is the perfect tool in our
therapeutic culture for religious bodies to speak to the moral
failures of their spiritual ancestors,'' said Robert Parham,
executive director of the Baptist Center for Ethics in Nashville.
While apologies for the long-ago past ease the current generation's
guilt feelings, he said, they also allow religious bodies to
express ``cultural correctness'' and to ``avoid the controversial
and costly issues of the day by focusing on controversial issues of
yesterday that have become consensus issues of today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in how we address the sins of omission and
commission of the things we do today,'' Parham said. Why is there a
higher percentage of African-Americans on death row than in the
general population, he asked? He also asked why some banks
practiced racial ``red-lining,'' refusing to give blacks mortgages
to buy into certain neighborhoods. Those, he said, are ``real
issues today.''
</P>
<P>
   TEENAGERS AND ISRAEL
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when researchers affiliated with Jewish
Theological Seminary in New York did a study of the life of
Conservative synagogues, one finding was that young teenagers felt
most attached to Israel if their parents regularly discussed the
subject at home. The study included responses from about 1,500 boys
and girls who had just celebrated their bar or bat mitzvahs.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, researchers will go back to those adolescents to try
to discover how their Jewish identity has been evolving. Prof. Jack
Wertheimer, the seminary's provost, said the project hopes to
determine what Jewish activities the young people have pursued in
their high school years, and whether, in deciding on a college,
such matters as the quality of Jewish life on campus influenced
their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer said there had been ``a lot of discussion in
religious circles'' about the extent to which religious practice is
meaningful to young people. Results of the project will be
available next spring.

FEMALE CONDOM GAINING ACCEPTANCE IN THIRD WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.) (EDS: Note contents in graf 12, When men refuse...) 
(rk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ The female condom, seldom used in the
West, is catching on here and in many parts of the developing
world, slowly becoming an important new weapon in the fight against
the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven million have been distributed in 34 countries in
Africa, Asia and Latin America, and the device is gaining
acceptance among men as well as women.
</P>
<P>
   Properly used, the female condom is believed to be as good as or
better than the male condom at preventing infection, because it is
stronger and covers a slightly larger area. It is slightly less
effective than the male condom at preventing pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an urgent need for more methods to prevent HIV
infection, especially those that put women in control,'' said Peter
Piot, executive director of the U.N. AIDS program in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS and other organizations are working to persuade more
women to try the female condom. In South Africa, as in many
countries, they first approach prostitutes and other women with
multiple partners, since persuading them to use condoms has notably
reduced rates of AIDS infection.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the barely dressed women waving to passing cars on
Somerset Road here in Cape Town, Glynis Rhodes looks a little out
of place in her baby blue sweatshirt and jeans. But she is bearing
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' she says. ``Have you tried the female condom?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first group she meets _ seven teen-agers, all in
black, disoriented from drugs and working for two pimps lurking
across the road, know Ms. Rhodes. She hands out free condoms on
behalf of Sweat, the Sex Worker Education and Advocacy Task Force.
Almost none have heard of the female condom.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhodes patiently demonstrates it again and again, stretching
it to show how much stronger it is than a male condom, using her
half-closed fist to show how to insert it, getting each girl to
touch it. Some are still skeptical. They are young, heedless and
think they'll never die.
</P>
<P>
   Then she runs into Fazilin. Fazilin is 39, has a jobless husband
and six children, and comes from a conservative Muslim family, all
of whom think she works in an all-night restaurant. She has common
sense, charm and is something of a street leader, telling the
teen-agers to insist on condoms and to try the female one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been using it since Valentine's Day, and I like it _ I've
tried it with about 15 okes,'' Fazilin said, using South African
slang for ``guys.'' ``It's quite great.''
</P>
<P>
   When men refuse to use a condom, she said, she has gone into a
bathroom and inserted the female one. ``They never know,'' she
said, adding proudly, ``And they think they got flesh-to-flesh, so
I charge them double.'' The women on Somerset earn $25 for sex with
a condom and up to $50 without.
</P>
<P>
   While Fazilin unwittingly outlined an economic incentive that
may promote the use of female condoms, researchers say she is
unusual; men can usually see and feel the device.
</P>
<P>
   The female condom has some drawbacks. Even at the 62-cent price
negotiated by UNAIDS for third world governments, it is 20 times as
expensive as male condoms, which governments buy in bulk for 3
cents each. Sixty-two cents may be small change in America, but it
is a large consideration in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Because the female condom is bigger than a male one and has two
rings, one inside and one outside, some find it unsightly.
</P>
<P>
   Success varies; the condom is a hit in Zimbabwe, while in
next-door Botswana, another country where 25 percent of the
population is infected, it is almost unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa's Mpumalanga province, it is so popular that the
cash-strapped provincial health department is spending $700,000 for
more.
</P>
<P>
   Mmabatho Mqhayi, a researcher at the Reproductive Health
Research Unit at Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, said it
is more popular in rural areas ``like KwaZulu-Natal, where everyone
has seen someone dying of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   The female condom was invented in the 1980s by a Danish doctor
who wanted women to have a barrier method that they could control.
It won the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in
1993, and the sole source, the Female Health Company of Chicago,
sells it under the name Reality for about $2.25.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the relative enthusiasm in the developing world,
U.S. pharmacy sales are only about 700,000 a year. American women,
said a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, dislike the look, complain
that it squeaks and do not know how to insert it.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, though, AIDS researchers have been surprised at its
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were astounded at the response _ completely caught
unawares,'' said Dr. Kelvin Billinghurst, an AIDS specialist for
the Mpumalanga Health Department. ``We thought it would be ladies
putting it in before their husbands came home drunk and trying to
keep it a secret. But we found there was a demand from males too.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the conventional condom, which many men shun
because they say it interferes with sexual pleasure, some men say
that they find the feel of the female condom stimulating. Other
researchers report that some men prefer it to constricting male
condoms, appreciate the fact that foreplay doesn't have to stop to
put it on, and that it makes AIDS prevention the woman's worry.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is expensive but strong, the big question researchers
are now trying to answer is: Can it be washed and reused?
</P>
<P>
   Since they planned to sell it to middle-class Americans, the
manufacturers never tested that, and the packet instructions
discourage it.
</P>
<P>
   Reuse, however, would seriously cut the cost for Third World
women _ in effect, one reuse drops the price from 62 to 31 cents;
five uses cut it to 12 cents. And health researchers here realized
that some women were washing the condoms anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Soweto unit has begun formal testing, both in the lab and
with female volunteers. In the lab, condoms are repeatedly washed
in hot and cold water with bar soap, dishwashing liquid, detergent
and bleach, then checked to see if they are still strong enough to
meet FDA standards.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers, most of them prostitutes in the Hillbrow section of
Johannesburg, have been asked to use condoms with customers, wash
them and return them for microbial testing.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results, still to be discussed with the World Health
Organization, ``look promising,'' said Dr. Helen Rees, the unit's
director. The unit may conclude that it is safe to use up to five
times, if the user washes it with warm water and liquid soap,
doesn't let fingernails or rings tear it and dries it with a clean
towel.
</P>
<P>
   Now social agencies and health workers are trying to build a
market. Street demonstrations, like those Ms. Rhodes does, are not
ideal. Health workers prefer showing women how to use the condom in
a more private setting, where women have somewhere to try inserting
it and can come back with questions. But, with nearly 4 million
South Africans infected with HIV and another 1,500 becoming
infected each day, no one has time to wait until conditions are
perfect.

A LANDLESS TRIBE'S CASINO PLAN RAISES HOPES IN A GEORGIA COUNTY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTA, Ga. _ By 10 o'clock on a typical summer's morning,
Hancock County is almost deserted.
</P>
<P>
   A few children play in overgrown backyards full of junk cars and
rotting timbers, and older people fan themselves on sagging
porches. But almost anyone who works has left the county hours
before, because there are virtually no jobs in Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``pocket of poverty'' cannot begin to describe the
overwhelming stillness of a county with no economy: the deserted
roads and store aisles, the fertile old cotton fields untilled and
overgrown. Every employer of any size has left, and new ones
seeking cheap land look at the county's statistics _ more than half
the adults did not finish high school, seven of ten births are to
unwed mothers _ and say no thanks. Unspoken in most of those
decisions is the knowledge that Hancock's population is 82 percent
black, the highest percentage in Georgia and the fourth highest in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Georgia is prospering now, and the state's unemployment
descended to a record low of 4.1 percent last month. But only 80
miles from Atlanta's economic turbine, the jobless rate was 10.7
percent in Hancock County, and its per capita income of $15,390 is
a third less than the rest of the state. The county's leaders have
begged for projects no one else wanted: poultry processing plants,
a landfill, a waste incinerator. Everything has fallen through
except for the prison the state agreed to build a few years ago
outside of this crumbling county seat, cut off from the county's
9,134 residents by empty miles and a haze of razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   So it was probably inevitable, given how money is spent in the
South these days, that Hancock County would place its hopes for an
economic future on the ultimate last resort _ an Indian gambling
casino. For the last six weeks, ever since the tiny Kialegee Indian
tribe in Oklahoma expressed an interest in coming, county residents
have talked of nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last chance for our county,'' said Lesley James
Roberts, Hancock's special projects director, who is spending
almost all his time on the casino project. ``Think about what all
those tourists could do for us. We'd have the money to restore all
those antebellum homes on the old plantations, and the storefronts
in town and maybe do historical re-enactments. It would give our
people a chance to become independent.''
</P>
<P>
   The casino is a long way from becoming a reality. Among other
hurdles, the state and the tribe would have to negotiate a compact
for a reservation, and Gov. Roy E. Barnes has said he was opposed
to casino gambling, although the state runs a lottery. (The federal
government could approve the project if the state refuses.) But in
the meantime, an instant bond has been formed between two groups of
impoverished people, each of whom is relying on the other to
achieve a dream of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The Kialegees, numbering about 450, are a landless tribe,
sharing space in Wetumka, Okla., with the much larger Creek Nation,
to whom they are related. Along with several other Creek tribes,
they trace their origin to northern and central Georgia, from which
they were forcibly resettled 160 years ago along the Trail of
Tears. The tribe has tried several times to build casinos elsewhere
but has been rebuffed, most recently in Carroll County, Ga., on the
Alabama border west of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll County residents, close enough to Atlanta to benefit
from its boom, said they feared crime and disruption from the
casino, but the reception has been very different in Hancock. Most
residents here are descendants of slaves who once worked the
plantations in the area, and Hancock is one of a string of largely
black counties stretching from Virginia to East Texas known as the
Black Belt. Most of those counties are significantly more
impoverished than their neighbors, even in a time of national
bounty.
</P>
<P>
   In May, after R. Allen Haywood, the editor and publisher of the
weekly Sparta Ishmaelite, noticed an article about Carroll County's
rejection, he suggested to Hancock County officials that they
contact the tribe. Kialegee leaders were immediately interested,
and received a warm reception at an overflowing town meeting here
last week. They were even more intrigued when they learned that
there are several large Indian mounds in Hancock County, of unknown
origin and dating back hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an almost instant camaraderie between the tribal
members and the citizens of the county,'' said Kenneth R. Baldwin,
who runs an investment group in McAlester, Okla., that is
representing the Kialegees. ``They both have an understanding of
what it means to have to struggle, to not have the opportunities
you'd like to have. The tribe felt more welcome there than anywhere
else they have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the county have heard all of society's warnings
about gambling, and are aware that it is not always a pathway out
of distress. But they have also seen marketing studies showing that
there is no other full-fledged casino in Georgia, Florida or the
Carolinas, and are convinced gamblers will make their way to this
nearly abandoned county once the lights flash on the proposed
casino, hotel and golf course. Considering Hancock's current
situation _ in which the largest employer is its public school
system _ the county's leaders say they could hardly do worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place where people are struggling to keep a roof
over their heads and clothes on their backs,'' Roberts said. ``Our
history hasn't put us in a position to be very selective about what
we want.''

TEXAS TV ANCHORMAN SHARES IN $37 MILLION LOTTERY JACKPOT 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More times than he can remember, Weslaco
television news anchor Peter Torgerson has informed viewers about
yet another South Texas resident becoming a lottery millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, it was Torgerson's turn in the news spotlight as
Texas Lottery officials disclosed that the 43-year-old Harlingen
resident was co-owner of a $37 million jackpot _ the first ever
claimed by a Texas newsman.
</P>
<P>
   Torgerson and his wife, Julie, bought the winning ticket July 17
as a birthday gift for a friend, who agreed when Torgerson made a
light-hearted request that the proceeds be shared if the gift
ticket were a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The friend, Mark Hulings, a 38-year-old Rio Hondo landscaper,
kept his promise. He agreed to split the lump-sum ``cash option,''
which amounts to $19.4 million, or $9.7 million apiece, for
Torgerson and Hulings.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by their wives, the men collected their winnings at the
Texas Lottery Commission offices Friday through their newly formed
H.T. Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of unusual being on this side of the camera because
I've been on the other side so long,'' said Torgerson, a 20-year
veteran at KRGV-TV, an ABC affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an incredible feeling. It really is,'' said
Torgerson, beaming with joy. He and his wife, a nurse, have three
school-age children, as do the Hulingses.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Hulings, Torgerson playfully asked: ``You still want
that bottle of Jack Daniels?''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining, Torgerson said that at his friend's birthday party
last Saturday, Hulings seemed most impressed with the bottle of
whiskey one of his guests gave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't seem to like those lottery tickets,'' Torgerson
chided, conceding that his $5 outlay on the five ``Quick Pick''
tickets might have seemed skimpy at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a birthday party at Mark's house. On the way I thought,
`For a birthday present, let's buy Mark some lottery tickets.'''
</P>
<P>
   Torgerson and his wife had stopped at La Tienda Crossroads
convenience store in Harlingen for gasoline on their way to the
Hulings home. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The tickets were actually bought by Julie Torgerson, a
non-player, after her husband instructed her how to do it. She was
such a novice that she entered the store, then came back out to ask
her husband a second time how to fill out a play slip and specify
the lump-sum option, Torgerson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I gave them to Mark, I told him, `Of course, if you hit
the jackpot, we have to split it, right?' And he said, `Sure,'''
Torgerson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good enough friends that that's exactly what happened.
Nobody could have imagined something like this was going to happen.
It's just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulings' wife, Trinidad, first verified that the ticket was a
winner the day after the birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were horrible numbers,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers were 21, 22, 27, 28, 31 and 35.
</P>
<P>
   Torgerson said he opted to keep their good fortune a secret for
several days until he was positive they had won. While the
verification was under way, he sought an attorney's advice and
formed a legal entity with Hulings to bank the cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part was going back to work Monday and sitting
there while we were doing stories about how the lottery winner had
not come forward. Fortunately, I never got to write one of those
stories or read one of those stories,'' he said. ``I didn't want to
lose my credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many times as a news anchor I've read stories
about people winning the lottery. My co-anchor and I are always
joking about how we forget to buy lottery tickets'' on the nights
of big drawings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torgerson said he's not sure whether he'll stay on the job or
pursue other interests. He currently anchors the station's
newscasts at 5, 6 and 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't actually decided. I enjoy my job _ that's why I've
been there 20 years,'' he said. ``Of course, the first thought is,
`I'm quitting,'''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, he said he might take a vacation and buy his
wife and himself new cars, but he didn't predict any immediate
change in lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is really going to change us very much. And
I don't think it's going to change Mark and Trini very much,'' he
said, but noted they all will gain a sense of financial security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to have to worry about things like paying for
the kids' college education.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's now a firm believer in the axiom ``you can't win if
you don't buy a ticket. That's exactly what it's all about when it
comes to the Texas Lottery ... It's worth at least a buck.''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the companies reporting boffo earnings last
week was the Bear Stearns Companies, the nation's fourth-largest
publicly traded brokerage firm. A big beneficiary of Wall Street's
nonstop party, Bear Stearns reported that net income for the
quarter ended June 30 rose 56.2 percent from the comparable period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company even managed to eke out an earnings gain of almost 2
percent for its entire fiscal year, no small feat given the
upheaval in the global markets last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns made $673 million for the year. Records were set in
all the company's major businesses: commissions, investment banking
and principal transactions, otherwise known as trading.
</P>
<P>
   Another monster business at Bear Stearns is the subsidiary that
clears securities trades for customers of brokerage firms whose
capital and administrative staff are too small to do it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   James E. Cayne, president and chief executive, said in the
earnings announcement on Wednesday: ``Our clearing business was
again a significant and consistent contributor to results.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial details regarding the clearing operation are not
public. It has been said to account for one-quarter to one-third of
the brokerage firm's revenues, which were $4.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the clearing business has an underside: Bear Stearns has
cleared trades and provided capital for a number of small brokerage
firms, now defunct, that prosecutors say flimflammed investors out
of hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bear Stearns' customer firms was A.R. Baron, a New York
firm in which investors lost $75 million; prosecutors won 13
convictions against executives and brokers of the firm. Others were
Sterling Foster, also in New York, accused of cheating investors of
$100 million; and Stratton Oakmont, a Long Island firm that was
closed by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Another troubled firm for which Bear Stearns cleared trades made
headlines on Thursday. Principals and employees at Kensington
Wells, a defunct Long Island brokerage firm, were indicted by the
United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn. Prosecutors say 15
people there bilked investors out of tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Bear Stearns cleared trades for those firms does
not make them complicitous in any wrongdoing, of course. And Bear
Stearns has maintained that the responsibility for protecting
investors who do business with its clearing firm customers lies not
with itself but with the firm that counts those investors as its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Case law has supported this view. But A.R. Baron, for one, could
not have pillaged and plundered unless a larger firm had been
willing to process its trades.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Bear Stearns agreed in principle to a settlement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a case brought
against Bear Stearns for its role as the clearing firm for A.R.
Baron. Although the details are still being ironed out, Bear
Stearns agreed to pay $25 million, $20 million of which would be
for customers who lost money to A.R. Baron.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a lot of money, until it is put beside the
results Bear Stearns announced this week; $20 million is not even 3
percent of what Bear Stearns made last year, and only 26 percent of
what A.R. Baron investors lost. Cayne could write the check to the
SEC himself: His total compensation last year was $27.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns considers itself a great firm. Winston Churchill
once said that the price of greatness is responsibility _ assuming
it, not shirking it.

FOR AMERICANS, A STAR IS GONE FROM THE FIRMAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 25, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a quiet dignity and appropriate distance to the
memorial for the last John F. Kennedy. Banning reporters and
microphones made sense; JFK Jr. never needed exposure, and
definitely didn't need any more last week.
</P>
<P>
   The eruption of sorrow triggered by his plane crash is in large
part explained by the grip he had on the subliminal feelings of the
world at large. There are four living ex-presidents, and a gaggle
of relatives of dead presidents, including more Roosevelts than you
could shake a cigarette-holder at. But none of the other
presidential progeny, not even his sister, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg, will rate the kind of sendoff this dashing young
cavalier of a Kennedy got. Gen. George Marshall won World War II,
as much as a any soldier can claim to have won it, yet his passing
was nowhere as widely remarked as the young pilot's sad accident.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his aversion to the grinding conflict of the grimy
business of politics and office-seeking, the young Kennedy
epitomized the dash and flair of priviliged youth assaying a higher
calling. The sense of loss was more keenly felt because he was
young, his demise was unexpected, he was owed a lot more living,
considering the toll exacted on his famous family. He surfed over
the daily grind of the family firm.
</P>
<P>
   Death hits young people harder than their parents' generation.
The young are always shocked by death. Whenever a teenager gets
killed in a car wreck, the high school classmates are stunned at
the severity, finality and lack of any kind of reprieve or appeal
from the ultimate sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Because the young Kennedy was never a warrior, a hero, or a
victim, the astonishing level of the mourning at his death caught
the news industry by surprise. I never got the feeling the news biz
was leading the Kennedys' incredible week; rather, we were all
following in its wake. If you build it, they will come. And John
built something we did not comprehend until it was snatched away.
There is a hole in the firmament where this slim, elegant,
well-mannered fellow used to dwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew what the phrase `hostage to fortune' meant until
I had a child,'' his father admitted a third of a century back.
He'd passed over from the leafy realm of youth, which is surprised
whenever anyone not old dies, to the darker precincts of adulthood,
where the realization strikes home that the tide does not always
come in, but also goes out. Way out. The Bessette family's
heart-wrenching statement on the loss of two daughters concluded:
``Nothing in life prepares you for the loss of a child.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an old saw in the news business: Don't ever die in a
plane crash with a celebrity on board, because in the obituary
you'll only be a footnote. There have been more than 500 books
written about Kennedys, and the events of last week will propel a
strong push toward 600. The clan is the most pawed-over cohort in
media history, and they can blame Old Joe, the Founding Father, for
creating the PR erector set that now runs as a perpetual motion
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuing John's persona from the dross of paparazzi
confrontations was his habit of self-mockery, his relentless font
of patience and goodwill. This made him tremendously appealing to
the young. He let the rest of us in on the joke. Not just the
eyebrow-rolling that goes with the territory of being a famous
relative, a son-of, nephew-of, cousin-of. But the bigger joke, the
larger irony, that being rich, good-looking, connected, was of
itself not enough to have a satisfying life.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to secure audiences with literally anyone on the
planet. Want to meet the Pope? Muhammad Ali? Mother Teresa? Michael
Jordan? John could do that, at will. So he turned his incandescent
celebrity into a career: publisher of George Magazine. Maybe his
magazine concept was flawed or fluffy. He strove to redeem
politics, by making it exciting and attractive and important to the
young. How? He did it by focusing on lifestyle instead of
lawgiving, trying to seduce his apathetic and jaded contemporaries
into thinking about how they want to live.
</P>
<P>
   He reached well beyond partisanship and the prison bars of
ideology or genealogy. He hired Al D'Amato, and Newt Gingrich's old
PR guy, among others, and pushed Sen. John McCain's maverick GOP
candidacy. Think of what John was not: He was not clumsy, rude,
over-bearing, mean-spirited, doctrinaire, heavy-handed, ruthless or
grasping. He floated above the daily scuffle of ordinary life. He
partook of all of life's bounty with an elegant, understated air,
too well-mannered to be jaunty, but happy nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   The flame of other celebrities, taken in death, can astonish us
with its temporary brightness. Who knew Princess Diana was as
widely, never mind how well, thought of, till her fatal auto crash
in Paris sparked a level of global sympathy that left Mother
Teresa's contemporaneous demise pale by comparison?
</P>
<P>
   Partly it was that Mother Teresa, a wizened old octogenarian
nun, had lived her life; Di kept making a mess of hers, and never
got herself straight. The loss of what might have been figured in
her posthumous canonization. But in the person of the 38-year old
JFK Jr., the sense of loss experienced by millions cannot be
trivialized away by squishy psychologizing. John's gentle style
made a difference, and drew millions into his orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The death of anyone young is cruel. And wresting meaning from
the trivial circumstances of an accident as banal as a night flight
by a tyro pilot with a broken foot in a single-engine plane over
water in treacherous summer haze is heavy lifting of the first
order. People who carp that use of the term ``prince'' is
inappropriate don't get the point. Americans never wanted a royal
family. But they yearn for the expression of the ideal. They long
for something bigger, more meaningful, than their own humdrum
lives. And fastening onto the tale of this star-crossed young man
of humor and glittering charm is not a bad way to try to expand
one's comprehension of life.

PLANE, 7 ABOARD, DISAPPEAR IN COLOMBIAN MOUNTAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ A US anti-narcotics plane carrying five
American soldiers and two Colombians disappeared Friday in the hazy
mountains of southwestern Colombia, US and Colombian officials
reported.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said a search and air rescue operation was being
cooordinated with the Colombian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance comes two days before a visit by US drug czar
Barry McCaffrey, who has urged Washington to triple its military
aid here to $1 billion to help slow the drug flow from Colombia,
the world's No. 1 source of cocaine and a growing supplier of
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, a four-engine DeHaviland RC-7, departed from the
Colombian military airbase of Apiay in the eastern regions of the
country about 1:30 a.m. Friday on a routine reconnaisance mission.
The crew was due to return at 9 a.m. and had not been heard from.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the disappearance remained unclear, although US
officials said the plane had been flying in adverse weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   American and Colombian officials declined to say whether the
incident had anything to do with the government's civil war against
armed leftist guerrillas, known by their Spanish acronym, FARC.
Recent attempts by President Andres Pastrana to start peace talks
with the rebels have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a routine counter-drug mission gathering information to
support the Colombians in the counter-drug effort,'' said Air Force
Captain Jack Miller, a spokesman for the US Southern Command in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said authorities had their last communication with the
plane about an hour after it took off _ and the plane missed
scheduled hourly updates since.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft carries about eight to 10 hours of fuel and was
last contacted from southwestern Colombia near the Ecuadorean
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a mountainous region, and there was inclement weather,
cloud cover,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   At least three American civilian pilots, engaged in the aerial
spraying of illegal drug plantations, have died in crashes in
Colombia over the last 2 1/2 years. They were helping train
Colombian pilots and were working under contract with the US State
Department.

 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As lead singer of Limp Bizkit, the band currently at
the top of the Billboard album charts, Fred Durst has created a
million-dollar persona by acting like the least likely to succeed.
But Durst is not the loser he would like people to think he is.
</P>
<P>
   Within Limp Bizkit's sludgy, hip-hop-stained rock songs, Durst
expresses emotions that endear him to teenagers: frustration,
vulnerability and a sense of moral outrage. He embodies the stern
self-righteousness that can surface among young people when they
feel ignored and powerless. At Hammerstein Ballroom on Thursday
night, he encouraged his fans to unleash their negativity and reach
the good feelings buried below. But as he conjured the ``positive
vibes,'' he screamed, ``Leave me alone!''
</P>
<P>
   Durst's social conservatism was just like that of a talk-radio
host: he played the schlumpy, marginalized Everyman who just wants
a chance to live without interference from a bunch of weirdos. He
denounced freeloaders in ``I'm Broke,'' preached against
promiscuity in ``No Sex'' (and blamed women for the impulse in
``Nookie'') and expressed a libertarian competitiveness in
``Trust?''
</P>
<P>
   Limp Bizkit turned these square sentiments into rock by matching
them to an urge to destroy. The tantrum-like music switched from
meandering heavy metal to thrashing hard core in odes to catharsis
like ``Break Stuff.'' This mix of anger and brutality seems
disturbingly right-wing, but that's where Limp Bizkit gets
complicated. This band's principled fury enables it to cross a
crucial border in rock. That boundary is musical and cultural, and
it has to do with race. Limp Bizkit's members belong to the first
generation of rockers to have grown up with mainstream hip-hop.
These musicians are the 1990s equivalent of the rhythm 'n'
blues-loving stars who invented the classic rock sound of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The consciousness surrounding this process is different in this
era. Hip-hop loyalists, strongly aware of the racial exploitation
that haunts rock's history, have long distrusted white artists who
lay claim to the style. Such artists have to find their own form of
credibility, or else evoke the dreaded 1980s pretender Vanilla Ice.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, Limp Bizkit achieves authenticity by matching heavy
metal, the music of the white working class, with hip-hop. On
Thursday, the band's guitarist, Wes Borland, wore the garb of a
horror-movie killer (slasher films are metal's film equivalent) and
blended breakneck thrash-metal chords with spacey progressive rock
interludes. DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar,
riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John
Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky,
instead steering hip-hop's breakbeat-based structure into a
backbone for power chords.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the
band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and if Durst
had any talent as a singer. His limited range was clearly exposed
when Aaron Lewis of Staind, the night's opening group, outsang him
during the ballad ``No Sex.'' Durst's rapping engages when it gains
a flippant tone, but he seems to prefer desolate moaning.
</P>
<P>
   Most irritating, though, is Durst's outsider stance, through
which the band gains emotional credibility. He behaved like a man
of the people on Thursday, at one point moving through the crowd
all the way to the ballroom's balcony. But to feel connected with
Durst, his fans must relate to his estrangement. He expresses that
alienation mostly against women, and implicitly against anyone who
does not share his moralistic views. It is strange to see rock 'n'
roll, so often a force against prudishness, take this puritanical
turn.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kid Rock, who played an exhilarating set before Limp Bizkit, is
anything but prim. This Detroit native has been exploring the
juncture of metal and hip-hop for a decade, mostly in ignominious
obscurity. Now he is flashily making the most of his moment.
</P>
<P>
   With his stringy blond hair flying, running around a stage
adorned with lit-up American flags and a raised middle finger, Kid
Rock was trashy, naughty, sexy and fun. He was an old-school rocker
embracing hip-hop as another source of outlaw glamour. Unlike Limp
Bizkit, Kid Rock and his motley band, which included the dwarf
rapper Joey C., acted as if they had a right to enjoy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock is an equal opportunity ransacker, taking from both rap
classicists like Public Enemy and Run DMC and party rockers like
Aerosmith and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Those groups got proper
acknowledgment from him Thursday; Run DMC even took his place
onstage briefly during the band's last jam.
</P>
<P>
   The rap group reprised its groundbreaking 1986 rap-metal remake
of Aerosmith's ``Walk This Way'' before Kid Rock emerged from the
wings in a white fur coat, hat and vinyl pants, an inner-city
vision of fashion overkill. The sight of this skinny white person
strutting around like the star of ``Superfly'' might have been
offensive, except that Kid Rock's music had already made the case
for his deserving to assume the style.
</P>
<P>
   No one could accuse Kid Rock of being socially progressive; by
his own admission on Thursday, his political vision extends no
further than considering Monica Lewinsky wanton. His raps can be
repugnant, even pornographic. But he welcomes the weirdness of the
world instead of acting afraid of it, and that makes him a truer
rock 'n' roller than some right now.

KUBRICK'S CONTROL OVER `EYES' EXTENDED TO BOOK'S RERELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RUTHE STEIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ Like the arm reaching out of a grave in
``Carrie,'' even in death director Stanley Kubrick has a hand in
controlling every aspect of ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' The unavailability
of Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 Austrian novel ``Dream Story,'' on
which Kubrick's final film is based, is the latest manifestation of
his obsessive control.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, when a movie has a book tie-in, a new edition is
prominently displayed in stores before the film's release. But
looking for ``Dream Story'' in the eight days since ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' opened July 16 was an exercise in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   With no copies in stock, bookstores in the Bay Area and across
the country had to turn away thousands of would-be readers. Even
Amazon.com, which prides itself on its extensive selection, could
only take back orders online. Looking for it in used bookstores has
been confusing because the novella, titled ``Traumnovelle'' in
German, is called ``Rhapsody'' in some American editions.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Books, a division of the same corporation as Warner
Bros., which released ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' has a 192-page, $12.95
paperback edition in the works. To further confuse matters, it will
be called ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' Publication was delayed because of an
agreement that it include Kubrick's screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an embargo on the screenplay,'' said Les Pockell,
associate publisher of Warner Books. ``Nobody was allowed to see it
until the movie opened. We licensed the book from Warner Bros., and
they made their arrangement through Kubrick's organization.'' He
added that he has been as frustrated as readers not to be able to
have the book in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers had been told that it wouldn't be available until
September. But through a Herculean effort to rush it into print,
Pockell said, he hopes to get the new edition _ with a sexy photo
of the film's stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, on the cover _
in stores by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   When Kubrick licensed the dramatization rights to ``Dream
Story,'' he also licensed the English-language book rights. ``He
did not want the book to appear except in conjunction with the
screenplay. So the only way anyone can read the book is the way
we're publishing it,'' Pockell said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This was bad news for Sun &AMP; Moon Classics, a tiny publishing
house in Los Angeles that had owned the rights to Schnitzler's
novella and kept it in print in the United States for the last nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pulled the rights back from us last year. The license had
expired for us, and they had allowed us to go on with it, so they
could pull it at any time,'' said Sun &AMP; Moon publisher Douglas
Messerli. His edition of ``Dream Story'' had been selling about
2,000 copies a year on the strength of rumors that Kubrick planned
to make a movie based on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it is a relief,'' he said, explaining that the
intense interest in the novel would have required printing 100,000
new copies. ``For a small publishing house like us to do such a
print run would mean almost killing us just in terms of getting the
run ready.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Messerli has gotten hundreds of calls
from people hoping to be able to get ``Dream Story'' directly from
Sun &AMP; Moon. ``They've pleaded with me, saying, `Please, can't you
just send me one copy?' But I don't have any left.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com also has fielded hundreds of requests for the book.
It has a $37.50 hardcover library edition on back order from AMS
Press, which photocopies the original edition. Even at that price,
more than 250 orders have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; But those desperate readers are unlikely to get their copies
before the paperback edition is in stores. ``As a matter of fact,
we're out of stock,'' said Gabe Hornstein in the customer service
division of AMS. ``We won't have more copies probably until
sometime in August.''

STRANGE HAPPENINGS IN DAVIS COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ERIC MOSES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- IT's official: We are living in Gray's kingdom
and we'd better get used to it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the monarch of the Golden State came down from his
throne in the Capitol and decreed that his 20-point victory in
November's election gave him supreme reign over the state.
</P>
<P>
   In his moment of regalness, Davis told the serfs in the
Legislature exactly what he expected from them: total compliance
and periods of genuflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect government to reflect the vision that I
suggested,'' he said, impugning his fellow Democrats. ``Their job
is to implement my vision. That is their job.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments, made in an editorial board meeting at the San
Francisco Chronicle, were Davis' most strident in his on-going, and
until now behind-the-scenes, scrap with Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Every week something new and strange is reported about Davis'
leadership and administration.
</P>
<P>
   If the GOP had a legitimate candidate to put up against Davis in
2002 they'd be drooling by now. They probably wish California had a
parliamentary form of government so they could take advantage of
the Democrats' once-muted and now very vocal displeasure with the
governor and his reign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Since he took office, Davis has failed to show what he's learned
in his decades of public service.
</P>
<P>
   He has set up an amateurish administration that has been unable
to close the party ranks. Seven months into the four-year term,
there are still vacancies in a variety of statewide commission and
high-ranking administration posts. There is a power struggle among
Assembly Democrats, and he's been unable to control it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Davis is stepping out on his own, riling and confusing his
political allies in Legislature _ the very people who he says must
implement his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a totally different view of the world than I do,
totally different,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles was
bewildered by the comment, while Senate President pro Tem John
Burton of San Francisco indicated Davis appeared to be rejecting
the theory of government upon which this nation and state were
founded. Both lawmakers were already upset with the governor over
his arm-twisting on health care legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis argued that he assumed control of the state's heart, mind
and social well-being on the heels of his big election victory.
Certainly, it had nothing to do with the fact that his opponent,
former Attorney General Dan Lungren, was so out of touch with the
electorate he couldn't spell e-d-u-c-a-t-i-o-n to save his
political life. Furthermore, most people feared Lungren would be
the one to turn to totalitarianism, not the big Gray whale.
</P>
<P>
   In his wide-ranging diatribe, the super-sensitive governor
actually whined that the Chronicle buried coverage of the
bill-signing ceremony of his assault weapon legislation inside the
paper, while the New York Times carried it on Page One. And then he
used foul language to deride a Chronicle story on his avid
fund-raising abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody ought to tell Davis that just because he's governor
does not mean he can control the media.
</P>
<P>
   What's so perplexing about the comments is that Davis has so far
failed to produce any evidence that the course he has set to
improve the schools systems up and down the state is the right one.
He only has a good won-loss percentage on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Davis inherited a state that had collected so many
taxes he looked like the Candy Man handing out the surplus to eager
cities.
</P>
<P>
   It's also odd that a long-time elected official, and especially
one who worked his way up the political ladder, would so easily
seek retribution for the years of abuse he shouldered playing
second-fiddle to Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately paid off the labor unions that got him elected,
doing away with several of Wilson's labor laws that he felt
restricted union members' abilities to make more money.
</P>
<P>
   When will Davis stop? It's hard to tell. In the fairy tale,
people were afraid to tell the Emperor about his new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, he has yet to run through the Legislature
yelling, ``Off with their heads.''

KENNEDY FRIENDS, RELATIVES PAY FINAL RESPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN AND DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - A week of national mourning for John F. Kennedy Jr.
came to a quiet end Friday, as 350 close friends and relatives
assembled in a Manhattan church to say their formal farewells,
while outside, 1,000 or so strangers stood solemnly under the
broiling sun to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   US Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the uncle who has served as
surrogate father to so many Kennedy children, eulogized this nephew
_ the 38-year-old publisher, philanthropist, and man-about-town,
who was viewed by many as the ``heir to Camelot'' _ in a 10-minute
speech full of fond memories, anguish, and humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a legacy and he learned to treasure it,'' the senator
proclaimed. ``He accepted who he was, but he cared more about what
he could and should become. ... And he could laugh at the absurdity
of too much pomp and circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembered when John Jr. was once asked what he would do if
he went into politcs and was elected president, and he replied, ``I
guess the first thing is call up Uncle Teddy and gloat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that,'' his uncle said Friday. ``It was so like his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended on a more solemn note, saying, in a paraphrase of a
Yeats poem about a man who died young, ``We dared to think, in that
other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray
hair. ... But like his father, he had every gift but length of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   After the eulogy, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, John Jr.'s
sister, got up and gave the senator a hug.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for the family, Caroline recited a
passage from Shakespeare's ``The Tempest.'' And the hip-hop artist
Wyclef Jean sang Jimmy Cliff's reggae hit ``Many Rivers to Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mass was an invitations-only affair, with no press allowed.
(Senator Kennedy released his eulogy later in the day; the family
spokesman talked to reporters briefly about what took place.)
</P>
<P>
   It was held in the Church of St. Thomas More, the same Catholic
church where John and Caroline's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, regularly worshipped _ and where she was memorialized in a
Mass five years ago. The Rev. Charles O'Byrne, who led Friday's
service, presided over the wedding of John Jr. and Carolyn
Bessette, who also died in last week's plane crash with her sister,
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Freeman and his wife, Ann, the stepfather and mother
of the Bessette daughters, were among the first to arrive at the
church. Richard Bessette, their father, and Lauren's twin sister
Lisa Bessette also attended.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn was eulogized by Hamilton South, who worked with her in
public relations at Ralph Lauren. A private memorial service for
Lauren Bessette is scheduled for Saturday night in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The mood apparently lightened somewhat after Friday's Mass, at a
luncheon in the Covenant of the Sacred Heart, a nearby Catholic
girls' school that John Jr.'s sister, Caroline, once attended. At
one point, according to two people at the luncheon, Senator Kennedy
sang ``A Closer Walk with Thee.''
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Hardy, a member of the O Freedom Choir, which had sung
``Amazing Grace'' during the Mass, and who watched the senator sing
at the luncheon, said afterward, ``We left on a high note, a note
of joy.''
</P>
<P>
   John Adams, another choir singer, said of the ceremony
generally, ``The family tended to look at it as more a celebration
of life than a mourning of death. ... Obviously, that's a very
strong family, and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the invited mourners were Kennedys by blood or
marriage. A few were ``New Frontiersmen'' from President Kennedy's
administration in the early 1960s _ Arthur Schlesinger, the palace
historian; John Kenneth Galbraith, an economist and ambassador to
India; Robert McNamara, the secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Other political figures included President Clinton (who
presented photos of John Jr.'s White House visits to Caroline, Sen.
Kennedy, and the Bessette family), First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, and their daughter, Chelsea; the other US senator from
Massachusetts, John F. Kerry; Connecticut Senator Christopher Dodd;
former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, one of the few Republicans,
who worked with John Jr. on the board of Harvard's JFK Institute of
Politics; and State Department spokesman James Rubin, who attended
with his wife, CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, who was a
friend of Kennedy's since his college days.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the Mass were boxing legend Muhammad Ali, who was
a friend of John Jr.'s; TV news anchor Diane Sawyer and her
husband, film director Mike Nichols; TV producer Lorne Michaels;
and Maurice Tempelsman, who was Mrs. Onassis' companion in the
latter part of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Ali was the only guest who, after the Mass, walked out to the
barricades on East 89th Street and Park Avenue, shook hands with
several of the police officers on duty, and waved to the crowd,
before heading off in one of the dozens of limousines hired for the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight, especially with Clinton's presence. Press
and public were kept a block from the church. Motor traffic was cut
off for 10 blocks, between 86th and 96th Streets, along Park and
Madison Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Armed Secret Service agents, on the roof of the church, yelled
to apartment-dwellers across the street, ``Close your windows!''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the distance, more than 1,000 people lined the streets,
some arriving as early as 6:30 a.m. and most standing patiently by
9 a.m. _ two hours before the Mass was scheduled to start. They all
stayed until it ended at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As the procession of mourners walked two blocks up Madison
Avenue, to the school where the luncheon took place, the spectators
remained quiet and respectful. Many bowed their heads. (The
Clintons did not take part in the procession or the luncheon, and
returned to Washington after the Mass.)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the morning, the crowds _ as diverse as the city
itself, including blue-collar workers, new immigrants, business
executives, and teenagers too young to remember the first John F.
Kennedy _ clutched cameras, held each other's hands, or hoisted
pictures of ``John-John'' as a child.
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene that has been repeated, over and over, in
spontaneous memorials all across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy, in his eulogy, acknowledged these sentiments.
``From the first day of his life,'' he said, ``John seemed to
belong not only to our family, but to the American family. The
whole world knew his name before he did.''
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the family said the senator and his niece,
John's sister, Caroline, debated _ until past 1 o'clock Friday
morning _ over how public to make the Mass. The senator wanted to
make an audio-feed of the ceremony available to TV networks, as the
family had done with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' Mass five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Caroline, a lawyer who has stayed out of the limelight
as insistently as any of the Kennedys, insisted on keeping the
event as small and private as possible _ and she prevailed. It was
also her idea to hold the Mass in a relatively small church. Though
her mother's memorial Mass was held in the same church, her funeral
took place a few blocks away, in a church with four times the
seating-capacity.
</P>
<P>
   However, at one point Friday, even Caroline seemed taken with
the public sympathy. En route from the Mass to the luncheon, she
rolled down the window of her limousine and waved, drawing smiles
and applause.

FRIENDS, FAMILY BID FAREWELL TO JFK JR., WIFE AT MEMORIAL MASS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Camelot, couture, politics and popular culture
converged briefly Friday for a final, sometimes hip, farewell to
John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation-only memorial Mass blended the ritual of the
Roman Catholic church and the singing of a Grammy-winning rapper
who performed the reggae classic ``Many Rivers to Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton led the list of 350 mourners, who included
Kennedy cousins, boxing legend Muhammad Ali and figures from the
worlds of government, fashion, broadcasting and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Some seemed still stunned that another tragedy had struck one of
the nation's most prominent families. Asked about his feelings as
he arrived for yet one more Kennedy funeral, former Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara said dourly: ``I don't want to express
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Kennedy family had promised a ``celebration'' of the
life of JFK Jr. and his wife, and at the end of the 1 1/2-hour
service, the O Freedom Gospel Choir roused the austere 126-year-old
stone Church of St. Thomas More on Manhattan's Upper East Side with
``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The closing hymn played off a phrase from a heartfelt eulogy
delivered moments earlier by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who
said his nephew had ``amazing grace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepted who he was, but he cared more about what he could
and should become,'' Kennedy said in his 10-minute address. ``He
saw things that could be lost in the glare of the spotlight. And he
could laugh at the absurdity of too much pomp and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like his father, he had every gift but length of years,'' the
only surviving brother of President Kennedy said. ``We who have
loved him from the day he was born, and watched the remarkable man
he became, now bid him farewell.''
</P>
<P>
   The service was closed to news media but participants later
described it, and Senator Kennedy's office released the text of his
eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend said the senator's remarks were ``an appropriate
mixture of humor and very moving tributes to who John Kennedy
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator joked that when the younger Kennedy was asked what
he would do if he went into politics and was elected president, he
said, ``I guess the first thing is call up Uncle Teddy and gloat.``
He referred to the senator's famously dashed presidential
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that,'' the senator said. ``It was so like his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator described JFK Jr.'s wife as ``the new pride of the
Kennedys'' and spoke of their ``thousand days'' of marriage _ an
allusion to the number of days that President Kennedy served before
his assassination in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   A former publicist for designer Calvin Klein, Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy was eulogized separately by Hamilton South, a family friend
and Polo Ralph Lauren executive.
</P>
<P>
   South ``underscored the simple aspects about who Carolyn was and
how she approached things,'' said someone close to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38; his wife, 33; and her sister Lauren, 34, were
killed July 16 when the single-engine plane he was piloting crashed
in the Atlantic Ocean off Martha's Vineyard, Mass. Their bodies
were recovered Wednesday, cremated and the ashes scattered Thursday
near the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   A separate memorial service for Lauren Bessette, an investment
banker, will be held Saturday in Greenwich, Conn., her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, most mourners walked two blocks up Madison
Avenue to a reception at the School of the Sacred Heart, where
Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, had been a student.
Riding by in a limousine, she waved briefly to a clump of onlookers
who broke into applause.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the block, on Park Avenue, a vendor quickly
sold all his $2 souvenirs, cards with separate pictures of
President Kennedy and the three crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, waiting in the muggy 90-degree weather, were
looking for closure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When today is over, it's final,'' said Shirley Johnson, 50, of
Hicksville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Others were just jogging by.
</P>
<P>
   One sweaty runner, 52-year-old real estate agent Don French,
said the crush of news media, which included almost 50 television
microwave trucks, was much like that for the funeral at a nearby
church in 1994 of Jacquelyn Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners started arriving more than two hours before the
service, showing small printed invitations to cordons of New York
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Limousine after limousine, most with darkened windows, dropped
off invitees. Only the president's car was allowed to remain on
89th Street in front of the church during the service. Clinton was
accompanied by his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had no speaking role in the service, brought the
family a photo album of the young Kennedy couple's recent visit to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of family members attending were Rory Kennedy,
a daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, and her fiancee, Mark
Bailey. It was to their wedding that JFK Jr. and his wife were
flying when their plane crashed. The marriage ceremony was
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Principal officiant at the memorial Mass was the Rev. Charles
O'Byrne, a Jesuit priest from the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola _
the site of the funeral of Jacquelyn Kennedy Onassis in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   O'Byrne married Kennedy and Bessette at their private but highly
publicized nuptials on a South Carolina island in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unusual moment, as described by those present,
was the musical presentation of Wyclef Jean, the Haitian-born
singer who was the star of the hip-hop group The Fugees. He sang
``Many Rivers to Cross,'' a song made famous by Jimmy Cliff.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, just an updating of a Kennedy family tradition
_ having a family friend or acquaintance who was an entertainer be
part of a funeral. Andy Williams sang at the services for both RFK
in 1968 and his son Michael Kennedy in 1998.

CORRECTS DATE WHEN EXECUTIVE ORDER ISSUED  
 SEATTLE HOTEL REVEALS ACCIDENTAL TIME CAPSULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The mystery of the Panama Hotel lies beneath its
weathered lobby, at the bottom of 19 creaky wooden steps, beyond a
heavy glass door.
</P>
<P>
   In a dimly lighted basement, belongings of a generation are
frozen in time: kimonos delicately folded in a heavy trunk; worn
suitcases adorned with stickers from Yokohama and Kobe; and a 1942
copy of the North American Times newspaper with a blaring headline,
``Evacuation of Japanese due within 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an accidental time capsule, this dusty basement in
Seattle's International District.
</P>
<P>
   In random piles stacked high are household belongings left
behind 57 years ago when the United States turned against its own
citizens and shipped Japanese Americans to internment camps like
Idaho's Minidoka.
</P>
<P>
   Forced from their homes in April 1942, a few dozen Seattle
families stored their possessions in this cellar, hoping some day
to return for them.
</P>
<P>
   But many never did, and their electric cookers, gallon-sized
cans of Kikkoman soy sauce, homemade tempura baskets and stone
drums used for pounding cooked rice into mochi (rice cakes)
remained tucked away, out of sight and all but forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the basement recalls a shameful legacy in America's past.
Yet it also offers a glimpse back to a time when Seattle's bustling
Nihonmachi, or Japantown, was a vibrant commercial hub of fish
markets, tailor shops, trading companies, banks and grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle artist Jan Johnson saw both in the Panama when she
bought it in 1986 to save it from being torn down like so many
other hotels between Fourth and Seventh avenues.
</P>
<P>
   From her artist studio across the street, Johnson had been
fascinated with the Panama, a five-story workingman's hotel at 605{
S. Main St.
</P>
<P>
   With a tiled bathhouse below the hotel, the Panama attracted
thousands of immigrants who came to Seattle at the turn of the
century to work in its canneries, sawmills, railroads and farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see why this hotel became so important to the
community,'' said Marie Rose Wong, an Iowa State University
professor in Seattle to do research on hotels like the Panama.
``This was the nexus and node.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sensed it when she descended down the Panama's wooden
basement steps and clicked on a bare light bulb. Where some might
see clutter, Johnson saw history.
</P>
<P>
   She devoted the next decade to preserving the best of it and
creating an informal museum to teach schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is American history,'' said Johnson, whose own father,
son of a Scandinavian immigrant, came to Seattle in the 1930s.
``This is what you don't learn in textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Hori, former owner of the hotel, offered to clear out
the basement when he sold it to her in 1986, but Johnson phoned
museum curators instead.
</P>
<P>
   From out of the clutter came a collection of 37 trunks that went
to Los Angeles as part of the ``America's Concentration Camps''
exhibit, displayed at the Japanese American National Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The empty trunks and suitcases, many stenciled with family names
and addresses, continue to travel. A smaller exhibit showed at the
Ellis Island Immigration Museum earlier this year. Next month, the
exhibit opens at the William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   What was in the trunks tells a story of families of Japanese
ancestry who were also distinctly American: a brocade pillowcase of
Mount Rainier National Park, Aqua Velva after shave, a list of
graduation requirements from Fife High School's 1938-39 school
year, 16 American flags bundled in frayed brown paper and a March
17, 1916, Port of Seattle special-election voters pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   The normalcy was shattered in February 1942 when President
Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066.
</P>
<P>
   About 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were sent to remote
internment camps in Idaho, Arizona, California and other states.
Two-thirds were U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   With just several days notice, Seattle's Japanese community of
about 8,000 scrambled to settle their affairs and find storage for
their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Some were forced to sell their possessions and property for
pennies on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew what was going to happen to them,'' remembered
81-year-old Hori, who was imprisoned at Minidoka from 1942 to 1945.
``We didn't even know whether we'd come back here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Even rumors of the evacuation in 1941 could not prepare families
for the horror of what was to come, said David Takami, the local
author of a book about Japanese Americans in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tumultuous time,'' he said. ``When the order came
down it was quite shocking that people would have to leave their
homes. They were able to take what they could carry and that wasn't
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   What they did not take with them, they gave away, sold or left
with friends or stashed in churches or private basements.
</P>
<P>
   Others went to Hori, whose family bought the Panama hotel and
building for $20,000 in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend asked me to keep some things,'' said Hori, a Seward
Park resident who ran the Panama with his wife for 45 years. ``Word
got around that I had storage space. `Can you store some of my
things?' they asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon his cellar was crammed with wooden model airplane kits and
ice skates, mattresses and bed linens and books and newspapers in
Japanese and English.
</P>
<P>
   Hori returned to Seattle after World War II and reclaimed the
hotel from the management company who oversaw it for his family
from 1942 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Hori tried to contact as many families as he could. But many
never made it back to this city. Some moved to the suburbs or out
of state. Still others didn't want to be reminded
</P>
<P>
   of what they lost _ by what they had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who needs a broken fishing rod?'' said Ed Suguro, a
63-year-old Nisei, or second-generation Japanese, and local
community historian. ``Later on it didn't mean that much to them.
As the years passed, they just forgot about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suguro was 6 when his family was incarcerated at Tule Lake,
Calif. He recalled how the Panama, like many hotels in Japantown,
was ``a social gathering place'' for male workers and later their
families.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Seattle's first Japanese American architect Sabro
Ozasa, the Panama was home to itinerant workers who paid about $6 a
month for one of 94 single rooms. Today single rooms cost $150 a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Hori's father was one of them _ an Issei, or first generation
Japanese, who worked in a logging camp and brought his wife over in
1906.
</P>
<P>
   They ran the hotel and leased out the bathhouse, which had a
separate entrance at 302 Fifth Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the bathhouse where customers could also get their
clothes laundered, original signs on the wall continue to beckon
bathers to ``take off shoes here'' or ``please put used towels
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertisements promoting local businesses like Yesler Hardware
still hang above 15 neatly numbered lockers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the peeling ceiling paint is badly in need of repair, the
bathhouse maintains its original blue and white floor tiles and
linoleum. Steam pipes run along the wall of two saunas made of
rough marble.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson plans to keep the bathhouse the way it had been when it
closed in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   It is thought to be one of the country's last surviving Japanese
bathhouses of that era, Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson plans to change very little about the basement.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, she has conducted private tours for
college students and schoolchildren, hoping that the presence of
items allows people to better connect with the meaning of Japanese
internment.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, Johnson plans to open the basement to more
visitors and add a teahouse on the main floor.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the building's store fronts, the tearoom will hold old
photographs of Japantown before the war. Another room would hold
exhibits from the Japanese American community.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the hotel on a recent morning, the Panama's current
owner pointed out her restoration efforts to the hotel's former
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Hori nodded at each turn and recalled stories about specific
people and memories.
</P>
<P>
   He paused before entering the basement and said: ``I appreciate
her doing it. I wished the Japanese American community had awakened
to it sooner.''

LET THEM GRIEVE IN THEIR OWN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was forced into valor before he could comprehend the word, a
3-year-old saluting his father's casket in what had to be one of
the saddest farewells in history. No one should have to be so brave
so young, and, just as important, nobody's young bravery should be
subject to so much public scrutiny. But John F. Kennedy Jr.'s life
had the makings and the lure of myth from the moment that tragic
gesture of a child was captured on film _ giving us an image from
Nov. 25, 1963, that came to signify not only the death of American
idealism but the innocence that had to witness its demise.
</P>
<P>
   Now, like Icarus descending, the boy has fallen from the sky.
The hearts broken by a president's assassination nearly 36 years
ago in Dallas have felt the tug of memory this week like an old
soldier's war wounds, and that return to sorrow explains some of
the country's current outpouring of grief. If John Fitzgerald
Kennedy had to die at the perilously early age of 46, how could the
gods have let the son _ still so young and unafraid _ fly so close
to the sun? There is a cruelty inherent in any child's death, but
when the loss of the father has already taken on the proportions of
classical sacrifice, the loss of the child may simply seem too much
to bear.
</P>
<P>
   And yet many of the most private and wrenching aspects of the
plane accident have been blurred or obscured from the moment the
first camera began rolling and the first commentator started waxing
eloquent. If in 1963 we were a nation unified by television _ by
its ability to bring us that unforgettable funeral cortege, that
riderless black horse _ we were also still enamored of the magical
powers of a new, untarnished medium. Celebrity belonged to movie
stars and stateliness to presidents, and movie stars hadn't yet
decided to become presidents. But one dark, unavoidable legacy of
the Kennedy years was the mixing of fame and nobility, with the
alchemy of TV confusing the two and suggesting that one ensured the
other.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing age of media-delivered luminaries has brought with
it artificial star power as well as artificial intimacy. The great
paradox here, which both Marshall McLuhan and Sigmund Freud might
have enjoyed, is that the less real these targets of our affection
are _ the more counterfeit the contract of familiarity, in other
words _ the more exalted they become.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, image has become the dominant lexicon of
the techno-visual modern age, assuring us with telephoto lenses and
high-pixel reproductions that we actually know the subject whose
profile is illuminated in our living rooms. With his gorgeous looks
and equally gorgeous bride, John F. Kennedy Jr. was lionized beyond
measure by the press and the crowds, too often for reasons that had
little to do with who he was. And the truth is that most of us
don't know who Kennedy really was, any more than we know Peter
Jennings or Madonna. What we do know, or can surmise, is that he
was a good enough man to endure with grace the glare of the
spotlights, put there by his family's fame and the myths that fed
and interpreted it.
</P>
<P>
   Which is finally not a story about celebrity at all, but about a
life lived beyond and in spite of it. This unequivocal fact is part
of what makes the public display of mourning _ the mountains of
tributes and dashed-dreams canonization, all of it playing
endlessly to the cameras _ seem troublingly misdirected. But the
effusion of anguish we're seeing is certainly real enough, even if
one views it as displaced personal sorrow or a collective brush
fire of sentiment, its flames encouraged by ceaseless media heat.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks had a word for this state of public emotion; they
called it catharsis, and they saw it best released within the
transcendent confines of a work of art _ ``Agamemnon,'' say, or
``Electra.'' Our own analogue in the modern age often takes the
form of a tribute to the war dead: How many of us have wept at the
Vietnam War Memorial, not because we lost someone whose name is on
the wall, but because the losses themselves seem mythic and
unknowable? John F. Kennedy Jr. never asked for the role of fallen
hero, but the suffering his family has endured over the past 30
years has assumed the dimensions of ancient tragedy, and it's
little wonder that our response would be in kind. In this age of
diminishing returns, he became something closer to fiction than
reality: a protagonist turned prince overnight by death, an
innocent child of Daedalus, plunging toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The families and friends who buried John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette have now entered that long,
private corridor that is grief itself, a timeless place with its
own laws, where no outsider can tell you how you feel or how soon
it will end. Like Shakespeare's Constance, who in ``King John''
holds close the memory of her dead son by the process of mourning
him, these people have ``reason to be fond of grief.'' The rest of
us _ today, in this instance, neither so burdened nor so singled
out _ should honor the living and the dead by not presuming to
claim their agony as our own.

 &HT;    New laser procedure some patients with coronary artery disease
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Along with the dull, aching pain in his chest,
Robert Seaver would break out in a sweat and have trouble
breathing. Whatever he was doing, he had to stop, sit down, take
his nitroglycerine pill and wait for the angina attack to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' he says. ``You don't get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes just walking from the bedroom to the living room would
trigger it. ``I couldn't lift much of anything,'' he says. He
couldn't walk around the block. ``No way. Not even to the corner
and back.'' If he went shopping anywhere, he had to pick a small
store where he wouldn't have to walk much.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors were out of options for him. At 60, Seaver already
had been through three open-heart bypass operations, another
surgery to put in an artificial heart valve, catheterization to
clean out his arteries and all the medications that help relieve
angina. His cardiac arteries were too scarred for creating another
bypass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of patient we were just telling, `I'm sorry you
have pain, but there's nothing else I can do for you,''' says Dr.
Mohey Saleh.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is something else. Saleh performs a laser procedure
that drills small holes through the heart wall. That minimal damage
coaxes the body into building new blood vessels to the heart, and
the additional blood eases the shortage of oxygen to the heart that
causes angina.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver was the first Dayton-area patient for transmyocardial
revascularization, or TMR. Four months later, after the time it
takes to grow the new blood vessels, he now says, ``I'm still
alive.'' More than that, he's mowing his lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I've got a riding mower,'' he says, but even
climbing onto the mower would have been unlikely several months
ago. He's not taking nitroglycerin anymore. The TMR hasn't cured
him, but he didn't expect that. ``It's definitely made a
difference,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty hospitals around the country do TMR surgery, which was
just approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last August.
About 80,000 Americans a year are diagnosed with severe coronary
artery disease, untreatable with bypass surgery or angioplasty and
often leading to heart attacks. With TMR, says Saleh's partner, Dr.
K.H. Lim, ``Now we can significantly improve the quality of life
for literally thousands of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't replace the conventional treatments, Saleh emphasizes.
When patients have cardiac arteries blocked, surgeons will still
try first to open the blockages with balloon angioplasties or
stents, or reroute the blood around the blockages in open-heart
surgery. But as Seaver illustrates, there's a limit to how often
that can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``In laymen's terms, the arteries are chewed up all the way from
beginning to end and there's no place to hook up a bypass,'' Saleh
says.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes medications can control the angina. Nitroglycerine and
other drugs dilate the remaining small arteries to increase blood
supply. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers slow down the
heart muscles to decrease the demand for blood and its oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   So TMR is a treatment of last resort. It doesn't require
stopping the heart, and it's done through a 4-inch incision that
doesn't require breaking bones, but it carries the danger of
potentially fatal heart-rhythm irregularities if the computerized
laser bursts aren't properly synchronized with the heart's moments
between beats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complication rate is very high if you do it on patients
who are not stable,'' Saleh says. Clinical trials back him up with
a death rate of 20 percent in unstable patients, compared with 3
percent otherwise. Saleh won't do TMR on patients still recovering
from heart attacks, for example.
</P>
<P>
   It generally works well on stable patients. The trials show 70
percent have had significant reductions in their angina, with an 80
percent decrease in hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon typically bores 30 to 40 tiny holes through the
muscular heart wall with a carbon-dioxide laser, although Seaver
had only 28. The drilling is timed to when the heart is full of
blood, so the blood protects other tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of creating channels in the heart wall to increase
circulation came from observing reptiles, whose hearts are
nourished that way instead of through arteries outside the heart,
as in humans.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, Saleh says, the laser-drilled channels
themselves don't deliver more blood to the heart. The body
considers them slight wounds to the heart and responds by creating
new blood vessels as part of the healing process. ``It's the new
vessels that increase the blood flow,'' Saleh says.
</P>
<P>
   An even less invasive TMR procedure is in the experimental
stages. Instead of going through a hole in the patient's chest, the
laser is guided through a catheter the size of a cocktail straw
that is threaded through an artery from the groin. Even newer
research is using gene therapy to stimulate blood-vessel growth
without any type of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the challenge is making TMR available to
everyone who needs it. These are patients who have exhausted their
medical options, remember, so cardiologists aren't in the habit of
sending them to surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say how many we'll do, because we never saw these
patients before,'' Saleh says. Starting with Seaver's TMR surgery
four months ago, Saleh and Lim have done five. ``But I expect it to
be more as people find out about it,'' Saleh says. ``You know. If
you build it, they will come.''

CAPITOL WORKERS RECALL SHOOTNG DEATHS OF GUARDS A YEAR AGO

   WASHINGTON _ Exactly one year has gone by since a gunman opened
fire at the Capitol Building, but Tony Rudy said he still feels a
spine-tingling chill when he remembers the events that July
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On this day last year, the gunman, Russell E. Weston, shot his
way into the Capitol, killing Capitol Police Officer Jacob J.
Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson, who grew up in Waltham,
Mass. A tourist, Angela Dickerson, was seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy, the deputy chief of staff for House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay of Texas, huddled under his desk with other staff members
while Weston blasted into DeLay's office with a revolver.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my head, I was thinking, `Why here? Why the Capitol? This
is the most guarded place on Earth,''' Rudy recalled. ``Then it
dawned on me. If the gunman was here to assassinate, he was going
to do it. There was no stopping him.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Rudy said, ``when someone bangs on the door a
little too loud or when the construction crew makes extra noise,
there are people who duck for cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the recent deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife
and sister-in-law, many workers in this domed landmark said the
anniversary of the Capitol shootings has made the mood this week
somber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anniversary has brought the feelings of loss back to the
service,'' said Sergeant Daniel Nichols, a Capitol Police spokesman
who announced the deaths of the two officers last year. ``It was a
difficult time, and this has been a difficult week.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Police officers and staff have been wearing ribbons and
stickers this week in honor of the two officers. On Thursday,
several members of Congress unveiled a plaque to honor Gibson and
Chestnut, and the Capitol entrance where the gunman entered has
been renamed Memorial Door.
</P>
<P>
   Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston Democrat, whose
niece, Evelyn, was married to Gibson, said the officer's family
still struggles to cope with their loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, every birthday, every holiday, they'll think
about him,'' Moakley said. ``When a death suddenly occurs, certain
memories come flooding back at these moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley had left the Capitol about 20 minutes before the
shooting took place. He first heard the news while at National
Airport waiting for a flight to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified but I never thought it was going to be John
who was shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings provided a ``wake-up call'' for many officers who
work at the Capitol, Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep that edge every day, and this was one of
those events that jolted us all out of complacency,'' Nichols said.
``It reminds us that critical incidents can happen at any moment,
any time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nichols said that because of a shortage of funding there
have not been any major new security measures instituted.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said the police will be armed with heavier caliber
weapons, and many of the metal detectors and X-ray machines at the
entrances will be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has also approved $100 million for an underground
visitors center near the Capitol, but just $2.8 million has been
released so far. Nichols said a visitors center would heighten
security because it would push the screening and entry point to the
Capitol farther away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Weston, who was shot and seriously wounded in the
crossfire, was found to be mentally incompetent to stand trial and
remains in a federal prison in North Carolina. There have been
several court hearings to determine if prison officials can force
Weston to take anti-psychotic drugs that could allow him to stand
trial. Weston has refused the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Those who work at the Capitol say they feel relatively safe,
despite the events last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get paralyzed by what happened,'' Rudy said. ``You
still have to go on and pray that something like this doesn't
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Brown, a Capitol Police officer who arrived at the scene
shortly after the two officers were shot, said she has been extra
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to be on your toes,'' Brown said. ``Sometimes
I feel myself feeling comfortable in my job, and then I'm reminded
of what happened and what I saw. Then I just snap back.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley said he is reminded of the tragedy every time he passes
by the door where the gunman entered _ where the bronze memorial
plaque now hangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are American heroes,'' Moakley said. ``They've taken
their place with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln _ heroes of
another time who used their lives for the benefit of others.''

   HOTEL-ART (Seattle) _ The mystery of the Panama Hotel lies
beneath its weathered lobby, at the bottom of 19 creaky wooden
steps, beyond a thick glass door. In a dimly lighted basement,
belongings of a generation are frozen in time: kimonos, worn
suitcases; and a 1942 copy of the North American Times newspaper
with a blaring headline, ``Evacuation of Japanese due within 10
days.'' The belongings date back to a shameful legacy in America's
past, when thousands of Japanese in Seattle were rounded up and
sent to camps. Dozens stored their belongings at the Panama Hotel

 &HT;    Georgia governor joins effort opposing federal suit vs. tobacco
firms
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Warning it could undermine financial gains from state
settlements with Big Tobacco, Gov. Roy Barnes and five other
Southern governors are urging top executives in other states to
oppose a proposed federal lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All states would suffer enormous monetary losses if the
federal suit is successful,'' the governors from major
tobacco-producing states wrote. ``The creative projects that you
and others have developed for your state to use these funds will be
cut back, perhaps sharply.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing a study by the American Economics Group, the governors
said more than $3.69 billion would be lost by the 50 states and the
District of Columbia if a U.S. Justice Department suit prevails.
For Georgia, that could mean losses ranging from about $30 million
to $80 million a year, the report by the Washington-based economics
group indicated.
</P>
<P>
   A federal suit would drive up cigarette prices and drive down
cigarette sales, decreasing the amount states collect in sales and
excise taxes. More importantly, it would decrease the amount of
money states collect from their own settlement with the tobacco
industry, because the long-term payouts decrease as sales volumes
decline, the study suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and more than 40 other states negotiated a $206 billion
settlement with the tobacco industry last year to recover the cost
of state-borne health care expenses related to smoking. Georgia's
share of the settlement is $4.8 billion, paid out over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Barnes, North Carolina Gov. James Hunt, Virginia
Gov. James Gilmore, Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist and South Carolina
Gov. Jim Hodges signed the letter. The governors asked their
counterparts in other states to lobby Congress to vote against
funding for the suit, which they said threatens to establish a
``terrible precedent'' for action against industries.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton promised federal action against the tobacco
companies in his State of the Union address this year.
</P>
<P>
   Much as the states did with their own suits, the federal suit
would seek to recover billions spent by government health agencies
to treat smoking-related illnesses.

IT IS NOT EASY TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE NEW YORK STOCK
EXCHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MARKETS-IPO) 
(rk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ How much would the New York Stock Exchange be worth
if its own shares were traded on the Big Board?
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to know, of course; they would be worth
whatever anyone was willing to pay for them. But it is likely that
it would be far from the most valuable stock on the exchange, worth
much less than several of the securities firms whose shares are
listed there, like Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Charles Schwab Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison can be drawn between the potential value of the New
York exchange and what is known about the value that investors
assign to the Australian Stock Exchange, which itself is publicly
traded. Using a back-of-the-envelope method of calculation produces
a rough market value for the Big Board of $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at that result is simple: the Australian exchange's
shares had a market value of $1.2 billion Australian this week,
which at current exchange rates is equivalent to about $780 million
in U.S. currency. The market value of the securities traded on the
Australian exchange is close to $1 trillion Australian, or roughly
$650 billion U.S.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the value of the securities traded on the New
York exchange was about $12.7 trillion at the end of June, or about
than 19 times that of the Australian exchange. Applying that
multiple of 19 to the Australian exchange's own market value
produces the $15 billion figure above.
</P>
<P>
   That is less than half Schwab's $38 billion market value and an
even smaller portion of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's $53 billion
valuation. But it comes close to the combined value of Paine Webber
($6 billion), Bear Stearns ($5 billion) and Lehman Brothers ($7
billion). The largest stock on the Big Board is the General
Electric Co. with a value of $377 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors might argue for a higher valuation for the New
York exchange, as well. While the Australian exchange is a regional
market, the New York Stock Exchange has global reach. Investors
almost certainly would be willing to pay more for the brand name of
the Big Board than they would for the Australian exchange.
</P>
<P>
   And New York has several other money-making ventures in addition
to its securities trading operations: it owns part of National
Securities Clearing Corp., Depository Trust Co. and Options
Clearing Corp. Those institutions earn money from all stock-trading
activities, whether or not the trading takes place at the famed
corner of Wall and Broad streets.
</P>
<P>
   By another measure, however, perhaps the New York market's value
would be worth far less than $15 billion. Shares of the Australian
exchange traded for about 32 times its estimated earnings in the
year ended June 30. The New York exchange reported net income of
$101 million last year. Even assuming that investors might assign
the Big Board a value twice that of the Australian exchange, that
produces a value of about $6.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of this assumes that investors take a rational
look at what the New York Stock Exchange might be worth. In the
current bull market, that is quite an assumption indeed.

BUSH DEFENDS USE OF TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD ON THE BORDER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's administration on Friday
defended the use of National Guard patrols to search for drug
traffickers along the Rio Grande and said the missions were not an
effort to ``militarize the border.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department suspended similar patrols carried out by
the Army and Marine Corps shortly after a Marine patrol shot dead a
civilian in May 1997, near the village of Redford in western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for the governor, said from Austin
that Bush knew of and has approved the use of National Guard troops
along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said Texas Guard members have not fired a shot in the 10
years the operations have been quietly conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not militarization of the border. This is part of a
drug-interdiction effort led by local law enforcement agencies,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The armed, combat-ready patrols aren't authorized to make
arrests or interrogate civilians, but they are being deployed
throughout the state, including two missions along the Rio Grande
this year, Aaron Reed, a spokesman for the Texas adjutant general's
office, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys do not make busts. What we mainly do is provide
support and intelligence to civilian law enforcement agencies,''
Reed said from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The around-the-clock missions, which last for up to 30 days, are
carried out by specially trained reconnaissance teams of
active-duty personnel based in Austin and Houston, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   The teams hide in the brush and gather intelligence for the FBI,
Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs Service and the Texas
Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are always authorized to carry weapons. Whether they do
so is up to the mission and the threat assessment,'' Reed said. He
would not discuss where the teams have been deployed along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out there to protect our neighborhoods and our
children,'' Reed said. ``If we stop drugs at the border or shut
down a crack house in a city or help sheriffs locate and destroy a
field of marijuana, we know those drugs won't make it into our
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-Texas, was surprised to learn of the
guard patrols and said they posed a threat to the safety of border
residents. Reyes, a former sector chief for the U.S. Border Patrol,
called the missions a ``prescription for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Esequiel Hernandez Jr., 18, was hit once in the rib cage by a
single M-16 round fired by a Marine corporal in May 1997. The Navy
Department, which oversees the Marine Corps, eventually paid the
man's family $1.9 million to settle a wrongful death claim.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard operates independent of Joint Task Force 6,
the El Paso-based outfit that coordinates military and civilian law
enforcement operations.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Border Patrol doesn't use the National Guard patrols
and has said it no longer will use armed military assistance of any
kind. The Marines were assisting the Border Patrol at the time of
the Hernandez shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the shooting, Bush said that the Border Patrol
``should be in charge of the border.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The military should not be enforcing the law on the border,''
Bush said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Edwards insisted the governor's approval of the
patrols is consistent with the statements he made after the
Hernandez shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has always said the military's mission is to
fight the enemy; Mexico is not the enemy'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush supports the effort involving the guard because
the 30 guardsmen assigned to help law enforcement in the
surveillance of drug traffickers are highly trained for the task
and extremely helpful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Guard missions, known as Listening Posts/Observation Posts,
are approved by the Department of Defense and the governors of
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.

BY GOLLY, THESE TEXAS LADIES PAY THEIR RESPECTS WHILE IN NEW YORK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When four ladies from Orange, Texas, scheduled a trip
to the Big Apple months ago, they intended to catch some Broadway
shows. They never imagined they would observe a real-life drama
that has gripped the nation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Nancy Finchum, Charlotte Montgomery, Sue Rathburn and
Jackie Smith stood behind barricades on fashionable Park Avenue,
cameras in hand, trying to catch a glimpse of the swirl of activity
going on two blocks away where a memorial service was being held
for John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got on the plane we said, by golly, we're going to see
what this all about,'' said Finchum, 62, a retired teacher from
Southeast Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always admired the family, especially John, '' said
Montgomery, a 58-year-old housewife. ``I thought he was just the
cutest thing in the world. He was a symbol of what we wanted our
children to be.``
</P>
<P>
   From their vantage point, the Texas ladies could not see the
Church of St. Thomas More, where the service was held, or the
scores of rich and famous who showed up for the invitation-only
service.
</P>
<P>
   But Finchum said she was still ``blown away'' by the scene,
including the crowds of well wishers, the rows of media trucks, the
tight security and the lines of limousines waiting for guests.
</P>
<P>
   The women said they would have liked to hear the private service
but understood the families' desire for privacy. And they had other
opportunities to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week they made their way to the trendy lower
Manhattan neighborhood of TriBeCa, where JFK Jr. and his wife
lived. They were impressed by the flowers and emotional notes that
visitors had placed in front of their apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   And just around the corner from the apartment they popped in for
lunch at Bubby's, one of JFK Jr.'s favorite restaurants, which
specializes in cobbler pies, roast chicken and pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   As former or current teachers, the women said they were aware of
the significance of the events that were unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history in the making, and I was a history teacher,''
said Rathburn.
</P>
<P>
   When she first heard that that 38-year old JFK Jr.'s plane had
gone down last weekend, Rathburn said it ``was like a bad dream.``
</P>
<P>
   And as with so many in her generation, Rathburn, 65, has a clear
memory of what she was doing when Kennedy's father was assassinated
36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day his father was shot I was watching `As the World
Turns,''' said Rathburn, referring to the popular soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   While some believe the saturated media coverage of the Kennedy's
latest tragedy has a soap operalike quality to it, Rathburn said
she understands the interest in the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that mystique ,'' she said. ``You can't deny it.''

 &HT;    Back porch soothes when sleep won't come
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 25.
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There'll come a night when you can't sleep. It has to do with
doctors and pills and trips to the drugstore, and you pull up the
cover and turn on all the lights in your room, and stack up books
you may or may not want to read. But you can't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   On such a night it's wonderful if you have a screened-in back
porch.
</P>
<P>
   Bats and things bam against the screens. Cats stick their paws
into whatever cracks they can find and make insistent pleas to get
inside.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't let them. You pull up a chair, turn a cushion
hoping to reverse the wet side so it won't ruin your last dry
nightgown, and you wonder what it was you used to think about when
nights were made for sleeping and you didn't dwell at all on
illness and medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Food used to be the antidote for sleepless nights. I tried that
the other night. My young kinswoman Faith had arrived with a Key
lime pie, which we stuck so far back in the refrigerator that we
forgot about it.
</P>
<P>
   Key lime, I thought, beach pie. They make it down at Julia Mae's
near our house on Dog Island. It's not as good as the coconut, but
it's good, and at midnight, who's choosy? The trouble is that you
stumble a bit fishing it out of the refrigerator, and Key lime has
a tendency to slither, but sooner or later you and it are anchored
in the swing and the creaking of the swing chains seems to soothe.
</P>
<P>
   You think over the books that await you upstairs, but _ like the
pie _ they are not as seductive as you thought. Tiresome murders,
even a history or two that ordinarily would appeal, but nothing
hair-raising, or even cover raising.
</P>
<P>
   On such a night when the weather turns cool, it's good to have
that extra piece of cover handy. Old quilts are intended for such a
night. When they are old and faded and almost weightless, you pull
them up and remember the women who made them and the families they
``kivvered'' with them.
</P>
<P>
   You might even, if you have a sudden and unprecedented burst of
energy, pick up a needle and thread and mend a raveling hem or
replace a ragged patch. But better to sit in the dark and listen to
the night noises, the whippoorwill down in the woods, the crickets
by the corn crib, the settling and stirring of the rain-soaked
earth.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder why you can't sleep. It's not a normal weakness. It's
the kind of thing that happens when your life seems out of kilter.
Family has gathered. Beds are all filled. Table is set for
breakfast. It doesn't seem normal or reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   You try to think of mundane necessities. Are there enough clean
towels to go around? Instead, you ask yourself what the doctor
meant when he said ...? Why did the druggist think the high cost of
pills had eased off a bit? He said ....
</P>
<P>
   What do you care what they said? It's time to totter up the
stairs and get back into bed. It's time not to care if towels run
out or some of the family simply hates eggs for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, there are headlights cruising over the tops of the
trees by the driveway. The youngest grandson has come home. In a
little while, another will be heard from _ time to start to town
for a workaday job. My dog yawns. The cats take a final swipe at
the unopening screen door. The Key lime pie has slipped and fallen
somewhere between the wing cushions.
</P>
<P>
   There always have been nights when you couldn't sleep. My mother
once told me, as we sat on the porch on Penn Avenue one rainy
night, that we couldn't get out of anything by dying. ``The women
in our family live forever,'' she remarked dismally.
</P>
<P>
   We do, and come to think of it, that's not such a bad outlook.
Bed and books and a spare quilt suddenly seem mighty attractive.

NYSE SAYS IT'LL GO PUBLIC TO RAISE IMPROVEMENT FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's largest stock market is about to issue stock in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its cue from the longest bull market in US history and
and boffo initial public offerings, the New York Stock Exchange
will become a publicly traded corporation in November.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso said Friday that the 207-year-old
Big Board needs to raise cash to buy an electronic trading network
and invest in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect that you and I, at Thanksgiving, will be
looking at the trading of a New York Stock Exchange stock,'' Grasso
told Bloomberg News, in an interview in Washington Friday. ``I've
not heard any significant internal opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The shares would be sold simultaneously to NYSE's 1,366 members
and to the public in an initial public offering on the Big Board
itself, NYSE spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition from about a dozen electronic communication
networks, or ECNs, which trade stocks electronically away from
established exchanges, is forcing NYSE to raise cash to finance the
move into a new era, as is pressure from the public to provide
extended-day trading. Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual
fund giant, and three other firms announced this week that they
were jointly establishing an ECN.
</P>
<P>
   The 207-year-old exchange is a nonprofit organization owned by
its members. It earned $101 million last year on revenue of $729
million, according to its annual report. Two weeks ago, a seat on
the exchange sold for $2.5 million. One analyst estimated that,
based on membership prices, the NYSE could have a market value of
$3.4 billion. A stock offering would give the exchange millions of
dollars to expand its offerings and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the way the world is headed and they need to be
a part of that,'' said Peter Bennett, chief information officer for
equities at the State Street Research &AMP; Management Co. ``They need
capital, and one way to do it is through a public offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission would be
required before the stock could be issued.
</P>
<P>
   And an NYSE spokesman said the exchange has requested a ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service on whether members who leave
their seats to buy stock would be subject to a capital gains tax.
If that is the case, the NYSE might scrap the idea, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is all quite a whirlwind, considering the NYSE's staid,
establishment presence on Wall Street. But, then, it has been quite
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average has climbed more than 7,000
points since 1994, and the NYSE has enjoyed a new allure. Tourists
now like to have pictures taken in front of the building in lower
Manhattan and they find themselves competing for space there with
fashion models using the neo-classical building as a backdrop for
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the NYSE's very intention to go public shows how quickly
thinking evolves in the go-go markets of the current, sustained
economic expansion. Four months ago, at a news conference, Grasso
said, ``While there has been speculation that we're in the planning
stage for our own IPO, I can tell you that it couldn't be further
from reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggested that going public could help ease
strains among competing factions in the NYSE membership, like the
major brokerage houses which want to keep costs low and brokers,
who work the floor of the exchange, who seek to make their
livelihoods more secure.
</P>
<P>
   The NYSE is not the first major player in the financial world to
attempt to take advantage of the bulls running loose for years on
Wall Street. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also went public earlier this
year, in a $3.18 billion deal, which came to market in early May.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, the technology-oriented exchange owned by the
National Association of Stock Dealers, also is considering issuing
stock. The NASD board is scheduled to hear an update on the groups
internal study next week. Spokesmen said Friday that there is no
set timetable for the process.
</P>
<P>
   With even the venerable Big Board considering joining the IPO
fray, analysts wondered where it is all leading. One even joked
Friday that, at this rate, the Boy Scouts of America and Harvard
University might one day issue initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE officials made it clear they are pushing the idea along a
fast track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrill Lynch is doing a pro bono evaluation of our options,''
said Ray Pellecchia, a spokesman for NYSE. ``We hope that it will
be presented for consideration by our board at the next board
meeting, Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the evaluation suggests that we should proceed, the board
will be asked to vote on it, and if the board approves, it would
then go to our 1,366 members, and we would go out and do a bit of a
road show, before their final decision,'' Pellacchia said.
</P>
<P>
   While the NYSE lists many of the largest companies in the
country, including General Motors Corp., International Business
Machines Corp., General Electric Co., and Exxon Corp., the Nasdaq
includes some of the big, high-technology movers of the 1990s,
including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., and
Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But a new rule, the NYSE Rule 500, approved by the SEC on
Wednesday, gives the Big Board more flexibility in any effort to
lure away the high-tech high-performers.
</P>
<P>
   Creating new trading networks should help, too. The NYSE talked
earlier this year with three networks about creating its own system
for the most active Nasdaq shares. Now it appears poised to raise
the financing to start a network itself.

350 ATTEND MEMORIAL MASS FOR JOHN KENNEDY AND HIS WIFE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the simple stone church where his mother brought
him to worship as a small boy, John F. Kennedy Jr., the country's
most famous namesake, was remembered as a young man who shouldered
the ponderous weight of legend and was still ``becoming the person
he would be'' in a memorial Mass Friday that united generations and
ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot, sunshiny morning, an eclectic mix of some 350 mourners
_ from the eminent figures of his father's administration to his
childhood hero, Muhammad Ali, to President Clinton, to many young
friends _ gathered in somber attire at the compact Roman Catholic
St. Thomas More Church on the Upper East Side to honor Kennedy and
his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts delivered an affecting
eulogy laced with eloquence and wit in which he said that Kennedy,
as the only son of the 35th president of the United States,
``seemed to belong not only to our family, but to the American
family. The whole world knew his name before he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the still embryonic stage of his career, he said,
``He had only just begun. There was in him a great promise of
things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   When the senator finished the 10-minute tribute, Caroline
Kennedy, the only sibling of John Kennedy, stood up and hugged him.
</P>
<P>
   Wyclef Jean, the lead singer of a hip-hop group, The Fugees,
apparently a favorite of Kennedy's, was chosen as the soloist for
the ceremony and sang the Jimmy Cliff reggae song, ``Many Rivers to
Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   The public claim to the Kennedys was evident in the hundreds of
people who clotted the streets around the church on East 89th
Street between Madison and Park Avenue hours before the service
began at 11 a.m., drawn by curiosity and grief.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral of Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
in 1994, the audio of the service was played over television and
radio stations. No such arrangements were made for Friday's Mass.
But the fact that the onlookers could see little and hear nothing
seemed irrelevant to their compulsion to be there.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Kennedy, 38, along with his wife and her sister,
Lauren Bessette, in the nighttime crash of the plane he was
piloting, has been a weeklong and heartfelt absorption for a
nation, and this final formal tribute was the culmination.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The mourners at the invitation-only Mass included a
preponderance of family members and political figures. President
Clinton attended with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their
daughter, Chelsea. Caroline Kennedy came with her husband, Edwin
Schlossberg, and their three children. There was Ethel Kennedy;
Robert Kennedy Jr.; Maurice Tempelsman, the long-time companion of
Mrs. Onassis; three Kennedy sisters, Jean Kennedy Smith, Patricia
Kennedy Lawford and Eunice Kennedy Shriver; Maria Shriver,
Kennedy's cousin, and Ms. Shriver's husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others were Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts. From his father's era were Robert S.
McNamara, the former secretary of defense; John Kenneth Galbraith,
the economist; Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, and Theodore
C. Sorensen, a special counsel to President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The altar of the church was plainly decorated with a spread of
white roses. Before the service began, Anne Freeman, the mother of
Carolyn and Lauren Bessette, read from ``Facts of the Faith,'' a
compilation of sermons by Henry Scott Holland: ``Death is nothing
at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy read 11 lines from Prospero's speech in
Shakespeare's ``The Tempest,'' that began, ``Our revels now are
ended,'' and concluded, ``We are such stuff as dreams are made on,
and our little life is rounded with a sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Radziwill, daughter of Lee Radziwill, Mrs. Onassis'
half-sister, read a passage from ``The Book of Ruth,'' and her
brother, Anthony, recited Psalm 23, ``The Lord Is My Shepherd.''
The director Mike Nichols, who at one time escorted Mrs. Onassis
around New York, attended with his wife, Diane Sawyer, and read
from Revelation 21:17. The gospel for the Mass was Luke 21.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Charles O'Byrne, who presided at the wedding of John
Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette, gave the homily, speaking about the
joy of participating in the preparations for the secretive ceremony
that was held off the coast of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons presented the Kennedy and Bessette families with
albums of photographs of Kennedy and his wife when they visited the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton South, a friend of the Bessette family, eulogized
Carolyn Bessette by praising her caring ways and the simple aspects
of her style and approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   In his eulogy, Senator Kennedy thanked the Clintons for their

what he would do if he were ever elected president, Kennedy had
replied, ``I guess the first thing is call up Uncle Teddy and
gloat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that,'' the senator said. ``It was so like his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   There was many aspects to Kennedy's life _ fame, power, wealth
and expectation _ but the eulogy centered on his unpretentious
nature and zest for life and adventure, on how he ``lived as if he
were unrecognizable'' and ``thought politics should be an integral
part of our popular culture and that popular culture should be an
integral part of politics.''

   Everyone laughed at the senator's story of his nephew arriving
in Massachusetts to campaign for him in 1994 with an enormous
German shepherd named Sam that he had just rescued from the pound
and kept in his hotel room with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his bride have gone to be with his mother and father,
where there will never be an end to love,'' he said. ``He was lost
on that troubled night, but we will always wake for him, so that
his time, which was not doubled, but cut in half, will live forever
in our memory, and in our beguiled and broken hearts.''

   Senator Kennedy's voice cracked at two junctures, when he spoke
affectionately of Kennedy and his wife, surrounded by Caroline
Kennedy, her family and other relatives, sailing together on
Nantucket Sound and when, near the end, he said, ``We dared to
think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would
live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But
like his father, he had every gift but length of years.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy's eulogy, the O Freedom Gospel Choir sang,
``Amazing Grace,'' and the 90-minute service came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The grievers began to arrive shortly after 9 a.m., passing
through intense security, and beneath sharpshooters positioned in
the tower of the church and atop adjacent buildings. Residents who
lived in the tall apartment houses across from the church were
asked to stay away from their windows.
</P>
<P>
   From the early morning into mid-afternoon, the neighborhood for
blocks around the church was at a standstill, with streets shut
down and traffic diverted. Television camera trucks, limousines and
police cars commanded all the available parking spots. A number of
businesses along Madison Avenue, including banks and boutiques,
simply did not open for business because no patrons could get to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The 126-year-old Gothic-style church, with just 15 rows of pews
graced with crimson velvet cushions, is where Jacqueline Kennedy
worshipped with her children after she moved to a nearby Fifth
Avenue apartment in 1963 after the assassination of President
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The service was a memorial rather than a funeral Mass, because a
funeral Mass demands that the remains of the deceased be present.
Though mention was made of Lauren Bessette at Friday's service, a
separate candlelight Mass for her is scheduled for Saturday evening
in Greenwich, Conn., where she and her sisters grew up and her
mother and stepfather live.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as soon as people learned of the plans for the
memorial Mass at St. Thomas More, visitors flocked to the church to
deposit bouquets of flowers, stuffed animals and affectionate
messages outside its entranceway, much as they had all week long on
the sidewalk in front of the Tribeca apartment building where
Kennedy and his wife lived. The expressions of grief were cleared
out from in front of the church Thursday night in preparation for
the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Morey, 32, spent all night traveling from Cleveland to
stand outside during the service. She came with her 10-month-old
child, her sister and their mother. ``The saddest thing about this
is the unfulfilled potential and he didn't live long enough to be a
father himself,'' Ms. Morey said. ``I think he embodied everything
that was good about society.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, the mourners filed out of the church and walked
somberly up Madison Avenue two blocks to the School of the Sacred
Heart, which Caroline Kennedy attended as a child, for a luncheon
reception. Caroline Kennedy and her family rode in a limousine to
the school, and as they passed the hushed crowd waving at her, she
rolled down her window and, tears in her eyes, waved back.
</P>
<P>
   Once all the guests had left, 89th Street was reopened by the
police and onlookers crowded in front of the small church. Some
stuck fresh bouquets and notes of condolence into the closed black
metal gate. For some time, they just stood there, not wanting to
leave.

`LIMP BIZKIT': SLUDGE ROCK MIRED IN PRUDISHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to DELETE photo note)  (EDS.: Spelling of ``Staind'' in 7th graf is correct; FYI, please
note word ``Nookie'' in 3rd graf may be offensive to some readers) 
(yn) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As lead singer of Limp Bizkit, the band currently at
the top of the Billboard album charts, Fred Durst has created a
million-dollar persona by acting like the least likely to succeed.
But Durst is not the loser he would like people to think he is.
</P>
<P>
   Within Limp Bizkit's sludgy, hip-hop-stained rock songs, Durst
expresses emotions that endear him to teenagers: frustration,
vulnerability and a sense of moral outrage. He embodies the stern
self-righteousness that can surface among young people when they
feel ignored and powerless. At Hammerstein Ballroom on Thursday
night, he encouraged his fans to unleash their negativity and reach
the good feelings buried below. But as he conjured the ``positive
vibes,'' he screamed, ``Leave me alone!''
</P>
<P>
   Durst's social conservatism was just like that of a talk-radio
host: he played the schlumpy, marginalized Everyman who just wants
a chance to live without interference from a bunch of weirdos. He
denounced freeloaders in ``I'm Broke,'' preached against
promiscuity in ``No Sex'' (and blamed women for the impulse in
``Nookie'') and expressed a libertarian competitiveness in
``Trust?''
</P>
<P>
   Limp Bizkit turned these square sentiments into rock by matching
them to an urge to destroy. The tantrum-like music switched from
meandering heavy metal to thrashing hard core in odes to catharsis
like ``Break Stuff.'' This mix of anger and brutality seems
disturbingly right-wing, but that's where Limp Bizkit gets
complicated. This band's principled fury enables it to cross a
crucial border in rock. That boundary is musical and cultural, and
it has to do with race. Limp Bizkit's members belong to the first
generation of rockers to have grown up with mainstream hip-hop.
These musicians are the 1990s equivalent of the rhythm 'n'
blues-loving stars who invented the classic rock sound of the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The consciousness surrounding this process is different in this
era. Hip-hop loyalists, strongly aware of the racial exploitation
that haunts rock's history, have long distrusted white artists who
lay claim to the style. Such artists have to find their own form of
credibility, or else evoke the dreaded 1980s pretender Vanilla Ice.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, Limp Bizkit achieves authenticity by matching heavy
metal, the music of the white working class, with hip-hop. On
Thursday, the band's guitarist, Wes Borland, wore the garb of a
horror-movie killer (slasher films are metal's film equivalent) and
blended breakneck thrash-metal chords with spacey progressive rock
interludes. DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar,
riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm. John
Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky,
instead steering hip-hop's breakbeat-based structure into a
backbone for power chords.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the
band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos, and if Durst
had any talent as a singer. His limited range was clearly exposed
when Aaron Lewis of Staind, the night's opening group, outsang him
during the ballad ``No Sex.'' Durst's rapping engages when it gains
a flippant tone, but he seems to prefer desolate moaning.
</P>
<P>
   Most irritating, though, is Durst's outsider stance, through
which the band gains emotional credibility. He behaved like a man
of the people on Thursday, at one point moving through the crowd
all the way to the ballroom's balcony. But to feel connected with
Durst, his fans must relate to his estrangement. He expresses that
alienation mostly against women, and implicitly against anyone who
does not share his moralistic views. It is strange to see rock 'n'
roll, so often a force against prudishness, take this puritanical
turn.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kid Rock, who played an exhilarating set before Limp Bizkit, is
anything but prim. This Detroit native has been exploring the
juncture of metal and hip-hop for a decade, mostly in ignominious
obscurity. Now he is flashily making the most of his moment.
</P>
<P>
   With his stringy blond hair flying, running around a stage
adorned with lit-up American flags and a raised middle finger, Kid
Rock was trashy, naughty, sexy and fun. He was an old-school rocker
embracing hip-hop as another source of outlaw glamour. Unlike Limp
Bizkit, Kid Rock and his motley band, which included the dwarf
rapper Joey C., acted as if they had a right to enjoy themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock is an equal opportunity ransacker, taking from both rap
classicists like Public Enemy and Run DMC and party rockers like
Aerosmith and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Those groups got proper
acknowledgment from him Thursday; Run DMC even took his place
onstage briefly during the band's last jam.
</P>
<P>
   The rap group reprised its groundbreaking 1986 rap-metal remake
of Aerosmith's ``Walk This Way'' before Kid Rock emerged from the
wings in a white fur coat, hat and vinyl pants, an inner-city
vision of fashion overkill. The sight of this skinny white person
strutting around like the star of ``Superfly'' might have been
offensive, except that Kid Rock's music had already made the case
for his deserving to assume the style.
</P>
<P>
   No one could accuse Kid Rock of being socially progressive; by
his own admission on Thursday, his political vision extends no
further than considering Monica Lewinsky wanton. His raps can be
repugnant, even pornographic. But he welcomes the weirdness of the
world instead of acting afraid of it, and that makes him a truer
rock 'n' roller than some right now.

CONNECTICUT PLAYING THE SORE LOSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I heard that Connecticut's attorney general had blanketed
the Massachusetts State House Wednesday with requests for documents
related to the New England Patriots' decision to stay in
Foxborough, I was tempted to draft an information request of my own
to his boss:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Governor John G. Rowland,
</P>
<P>
   ``Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I would like to
know the thus-far-undisclosed full dollar amount of the state of
Connecticut's offer to the New England Patriots, any correspondence
involved in your decision to offer Bob Kraft more money than any
sports franchise owner in the history of the universe, and any
documentation on the environmental condition of the site that was
to be used for the football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sincerely, Adrian Walker''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three months after the Patriots canceled their moving van
for good, Rowland and Co. refuse to go away.
</P>
<P>
   A host of Massachusetts agencies was asked to produce any
communications with Kraft, his son Jonathan Kraft or their various
companies that could prove the Krafts fibbed when they said they
weren't trying to stay in Massachusetts. Rowland would love to
prove the Krafts were quietly negotiating any sort of deal here.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the agreement with Connecticut fell apart
largely because of Rowland's inability to guarantee that the
pollution-plagued stadium site could be cleared in time to start
playing in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the idea of luring the Patriots was never any
more than a bandage for downtown Hartford or that no evidence has
surfaced indicating the Patriots violated their agreement with
Connecticut. Rowland insists on playing the victim.
</P>
<P>
   It was always a pipe dream, the notion that Hartford could be
transformed into a major city by simply adding a professional
football team. There isn't a problem there _ lousy public schools,
a crumbling infrastructure, an inadequate and shrinking tax base _
that getting the Patriots would have addressed.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no telling that to anyone in government there. They
lost their big score, and they don't seem likely to get over it
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Connecticut believes it
has three legal avenues worthy of investigation. His office is
examining the possibility of an antitrust action against the NFL,
breach of contract by the Patriots, or interference by the league
or Massachusetts officials with the team's contract with
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal estimates the price of the state's failed courtship
at between $2 million and $6 million, though he quickly adds that
``that isn't the only measure of damages, certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   He fails to mention _ perhaps he's already forgotten _ that the
cost would have been far more had the state actually had to clear
the site of a steam plant blocking construction and scrub the
parcel of years of industrial contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Rowland threatened to sue almost immediately after
the Patriots decided not to move, Blumenthal stressed the state is
only ``investigating'' a lawsuit. ``I'm not in a position at this
point in the investigation to give a percentage possibility of
filing suit,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, like the initial pursuit of the team, is just another
case of quick-fix politics. Connecticut officials believe they can
deflect their embarrassment over their failed project by going
after Massachusetts and finding someone to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland presides over one of the richest states in the country.
But it also claims three of the nation's poorest cities in
Bridgeport, New Haven, and Hartford. Their needs are many. Yet this
failed quest remains an obsession.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran argued for months that
Connecticut had overextended itself by offering to spend $375
million in public money to lure the Patriots, and he was right. The
deal Connecticut offered was indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly as a result of the Patriots' dance with Connecticut, NFL
owners set up a funding mechanism for new stadiums intended to
prevent owners of franchises from being lured to minor league
cities by outrageous sums to satisfy the egos of elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland is often touted as a man with aspirations to higher
office, a Republican rising star. I don't think he should pack his
bags for D.C. just yet. He has yet to learn one of the major
lessons of political survival: when to walk away.

CHILDREN GROW WITH GARDENS AT SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By CAROL BIDWELL 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENCINO, Calif. _ Some people take a lifetime to figure out how
to apply the lessons they learned in school to real life.
</P>
<P>
   Not Auni Hovanesian. The 11-year-old Encino girl, who studied
flower, herb and vegetable gardening at school this spring, can't
wait to get her hands into the soil in her back yard at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom and dad plant a garden in the summer, and we have
tomatoes and squash and lettuce,'' Auni said on the last day of
classes at Encino Elementary School. ``I'm going to have my own
little plot and grow things. I want to grow a peach tree; I like
peaches.''
</P>
<P>
   She's proud that she had a hand in the success of the class
garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part is when you see the seeds start growing,'' Auni
said. ``I feel proud that I was the one who grew something.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, the class carefully planted tomatoes, tomatillos,
peppers, artichokes, herbs and a variety of flowers in eight raised
beds built on the school's asphalt playground by local U.S. Marine
recruiters and parent volunteers. The kids helped dig up a narrow
strip of asphalt along a fence to make a home for more plants. They
planted _ and, after a few of the younger kids pulled up the
seedlings, they planted them all a second time.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard work, sweating in the hot sun, lugging potting soil
and mixing fertilizer. But that's what you do when you plant a
garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to pay a price to get the good stuff,'' Auni said
matter-of-factly. ``It doesn't just come without you doing
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Auni _ whose attitude many adult gardeners might envy _ is one
of dozens, maybe hundreds, of Valley kids who are taking what they
learned about growing things home for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-August, they may forget the fine points of long division,
but they'll remember that if you don't keep seeds moist, they won't
sprout. They may not remember all their history lessons, but
they'll know plants won't grow crowded by weeds or without
sunshine. They may not recall who wrote which poem, but they'll
know growing things need plenty of water and care in the Valley's
harsh summer.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just a smattering of the lessons the school garden
has taught the kids, said Auni's teacher, Laverne Potter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've learned a lot of science, but they've learned more
social skills than anything else,'' Potter said, watching her
fifth-graders study an interesting-looking bug on a tomato plant.
``They've learned sharing; they've learned self-control; they've
learned self-esteem. When the little kids pulled up their plants,
they talked about posting `garden police,' they'd developed such a
pride of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing we've found is that the kids who excel in the
classroom are totally lost in the garden. At first, they didn't
know how to dig a hole. But the kids who maybe aren't so good in
the classroom, who don't read or do math as well, compensate for it
by being a whiz in the garden. So they can see everybody has
something they're good at. It has nothing to do with who's the best
at taking tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit: All the kids can't wait to come back this
summer, bringing bags of chips and salad dressing, to enjoy the
salsa and salads they'll make from the garden's contents, once
everything's ripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tastes better when you grow it,'' said Chas Domike, 11,
Auni's classmate, who has his own strawberry patch at home. ``It's
so much better picking strawberries and eating them five minutes
later than the strawberries from the store. They just melt in your
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids are reacting just as the National Gardening Association
hoped when it gave Potter's class $750 last fall to be spent toward
seeds and gardening tools. Encino Elementary and seven other Valley
schools were among 300 schools nationwide to get one of the 1998-99
grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these grants are one of the best things we do,'' said
Valerie Kelsey, vice president of education and programs for the
nonprofit, 250,000-member gardening group. ``It's of small monetary
value, but it's just enough to get them started. And wonderful
things come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they learned at school or from green-thumbed family and
friends, more kids are gardening at home. Fifty-four percent of
adult gardeners polled this spring at a Chicago flower show said
their children get involved in the garden, and 43 percent said
their kids have a special section of the garden just for them.
Nearly 80 percent of parents recommended getting children
interested in gardening before age 6.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-graders at West Hollywood Elementary School also have been
lured into the world of gardening, courtesy of a class study of how
seeds grow, how sunlight and water affect plants, and which
containers make good homes for plants. In raised beds on the
playground, they planted radishes, onions, peppers and
strawberries, and even made their own compost to make them grow.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Danny Nerio, 10, has planted spinach and watermelons;
Farrah Palma, 11, helps her parents tend rose bushes and orange and
apple trees; Beatrice Rodriguez, 10, sowed tomato seeds in a big
pot on the balcony of her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening is fun _ and it's even more fun to eat what you grow _
but it's no job for lazy people, the kids emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to have a good time with your garden, you
have to work really hard,'' said Farrah.
</P>
<P>
   At Montague Charter School in Pacoima, the staff's efforts to
beautify the school have encouraged the students to work hard at
their gardens _ both on- and off-campus.
</P>
<P>
   The school used its $750 grant to fill new flower beds with
flowers, plant vegetables the kids could tend, and enhance the
narrow swath of greenery along an ugly alley that teachers and
students alike call the Secret Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Secret Garden) started as a very small dream of one
teacher (Tullio Picardo),'' explained principal Diane Pritchard.
``He wanted a nice place for his students to read, so he put out a
pot of flowers. Pretty soon, he had five pots, then he had 10 pots,
then he put up a little bird feeder. It just grew and grew and
grew.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the garden has a concrete path down its center, dotted
with tables and benches under shady pergolas where students can
read, teachers can conduct counseling and ``time out'' sessions for
unruly children, and the school staff can have a quiet lunch.
Lilies, perennials and native herbs add a riot of color, luring
bees and butterflies, and there's a tiny pond and a manmade
waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   The students love the garden so much, the school now has a plan
to pry up as much asphalt playground as possible over the next few
years and replace the hard surfaces with trees, flowers and
vegetables to illustrate lessons in nutrition, science, art and
history _ and to just provide grassy areas for kids to loll on. One
area, already planted with trees whose branches grow quickly and
spread sideways, will be a reading forest where kids can retire
with a book.
</P>
<P>
   All the growing things have not only perked up the campus,
they've piqued the students' interest.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Uribe, 8, says he hops on his bike after school most
days and rides to a local community garden, where he helps his
father tend a vegetable patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my special time with my dad,'' Vincent said. ``We grow
corn, carrots, radishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Anaya, 10, helps his grandmother grow roses and tomatoes
and tend her lemon trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be in the garden because you get to dig,'' he said,
a big grin crossing his face. ``And you get to eat stuff.'' &UR;  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Just about every TV critic will tell you that
``The Sopranos'' was the big story at Thursday's Emmy Awards
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the critically acclaimed HBO series nabbed 16
nominations, tying the series record set by ``The Larry Sanders
Show'' two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone (SET ITAL)expected(END ITAL) ``The Sopranos'' to
earn a bunch of nominations. If the gritty mob drama didn't swipe
more than 10, we would've seen Oliver Stone on CNN railing about
mysterious conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   This TV critic, however, will tell you that the real surprise
was that the Academy of Television of Arts &AMP; Sciences finally did
the right thing by nominating the quietly brilliant comedy
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' (it received six nominations) and ``The
Practice'''s smoldering Steve Harris.
</P>
<P>
   While I don't hold grudges, it did take some time for me to
forgive the Academy's bone-headed decision not to acknowledge
``Raymond'''s brilliance and Harris' searing performances last
year. When the Emmy Awards press materials were dropped off to my
room at the Ritz-Carlton, the first thing I did was scan the
Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a
Drama categories to see if ``Raymond'' and Harris were nominated.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, I didn't expect to see them listed. I was even
more pleasantly surprised to learn that HBO's bawdy ``Sex and the
City'' got an Outstanding Comedy Series nod.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, maybe all the nice things I've written about ``Raymond,''
Harris and ``Sex and the City'' forced the Academy to change its
mind. Or, maybe those anonymous, threatening letters I kept sending
that said something like, ``I know where you live, work and shop.
Be careful,'' did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing all the nominations, a clear pattern emerged.
The Emmy nomination gap between cable and broadcast TV is shrinking
faster than ``ER'''s ratings. This year, 19 cable networks earned
134 nominations, up from 113 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of noncable nominations was 248, only two
more than last year. In fact, this year marks the first time that a
cable network has received a nomination for the Outstanding Drama
Series category.
</P>
<P>
   While NBC received the most nominations at 82, HBO came in a
close second with 74.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that cable TV is pushing broadcast networks to
become edgier risk-takers. That's why you'll see such
envelope-pushing shows as ``Action'' and ``Malcolm in the Middle''
on Fox this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully when the Emmys are televised Sept. 12, we'll see the
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' cast and Steve Harris walking away with
the gold statues they so richly deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter wants ``The X-Files''' upcoming seventh season to
be its last. Fox, however, might have different plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contract expires at the end of the year,'' said Carter, ``I
know David Duchovny's does. Gillian Anderson's, I think, goes to an
eighth year. Right now I'm preparing in every way for this to be
the final season. I've heard second- and third-hand that Fox might
approach us about taking the show past the seventh season. But I'm
looking at these next 22 episodes as a wrap-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Duchovny come back?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say `never' about anything,'' Duchovny said. ``But
as of right now ... I'm living my life as if this would be the last
year, and I'd be fine if it were the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite how great ``The X-Files'' has been, I'm starting to
wonder if Carter is a one-hit wonder. ``Millennium'' was canned
after two years and ``Harsh Realm,'' Carter's new virtual reality
drama, doesn't look promising.
</P>
<P>
   Fox surprised us on Thursday when the network announced at the
last minute that Duchovny would be on hand to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen Duchovny on the talk show circuit, you know the
guy's a hoot. He didn't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   _ On moving the show from Vancouver to Los Angeles: ``It was a
lot easier in terms of lifestyle ... My wife (Tea Leoni) got
pregnant, which probably wouldn't have happened if I was in
Vancouver. And if it did, I would have had a lot of questions to
ask.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On life after ``The X-Files:'' ``I'd love to cut a single of
some kind, but I'm not musical.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On ``The X-Files'' going on without Fox Mulder: ``Nobody is
indispensable. It's a brand name. It's Crest. ... It's Menudo.''
</P>
<P>
   If Emmys were handed out for best network parties, Fox would win
every year. When Fox was launched 12 years ago, it was billed as a
fresh, youth-oriented network. That hip attitude is always
reflected in Fox's bashes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's highlight: Peter Roth, former network entertainment
president, doing a ghastly John Travolta impression at the
'70s-themed shindig.
</P>
<P>
   This year's party was held at Yamashiro Restaurant, an
eye-popping Japanese eatery atop the Hollywood Hills. While the DJ
spun everything from Ricky Martin to Rick James, ``Party of
Five'''s Jennifer Love Hewitt (soon to be seen in the ``Party of
Five'' spinoff ``Time of Your Life'') and ``That '70s Show'''s
Wilmer Valderrama danced the night away _ quite seductively, I
might add.
</P>
<P>
   If their shows ever get canceled, someone should sign the pair
to a ``Dirty Dancing'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some quick Fox news items:
</P>
<P>
   _ Johnathon Schaech (``That Thing You Do'') joined the cast of
``Time of Your Life'' as Maguire, a former session musician who
falls for Sarah (Hewitt).
</P>
<P>
   _ Jay Mohr, Luke Perry, Candice Bergen, Victoria Principal and
Patrick Duffy will provide guest voices on ``Family Guy'' this
season. Meanwhile, Mel Gibson, Lucy Lawless, Mark McGwire and Henry
Winkler are among the guest voices on ``The Simpsons.''

CAPITOL WORKERS RECALL SHOOTNG DEATHS OF GUARDS A YEAR AGO

   WASHINGTON _ Exactly one year has gone by since a gunman opened
fire at the Capitol Building, but Tony Rudy said he still feels a
spine-tingling chill when he remembers the events that July
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On this day last year, the gunman, Russell E. Weston, shot his
way into the Capitol, killing Capitol Police Officer Jacob J.
Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson, who grew up in Waltham,
Mass. A tourist, Angela Dickerson, was seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy, the deputy chief of staff for House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay of Texas, huddled under his desk with other staff members
while Weston blasted into DeLay's office with a revolver.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my head, I was thinking, `Why here? Why the Capitol? This
is the most guarded place on Earth,''' Rudy recalled. ``Then it
dawned on me. If the gunman was here to assassinate, he was going
to do it. There was no stopping him.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Rudy said, ``when someone bangs on the door a
little too loud or when the construction crew makes extra noise,
there are people who duck for cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the recent deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife
and sister-in-law, many workers in this domed landmark said the
anniversary of the Capitol shootings has made the mood this week
somber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anniversary has brought the feelings of loss back to the
service,'' said Sergeant Daniel Nichols, a Capitol Police spokesman
who announced the deaths of the two officers last year. ``It was a
difficult time, and this has been a difficult week.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Police officers and staff have been wearing ribbons and
stickers this week in honor of the two officers. On Thursday,
several members of Congress unveiled a plaque to honor Gibson and
Chestnut, and the Capitol entrance where the gunman entered has
been renamed Memorial Door.
</P>
<P>
   Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston Democrat, whose
niece, Evelyn, was married to Gibson, said the officer's family
still struggles to cope with their loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, every birthday, every holiday, they'll think
about him,'' Moakley said. ``When a death suddenly occurs, certain
memories come flooding back at these moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley had left the Capitol about 20 minutes before the
shooting took place. He first heard the news while at National
Airport waiting for a flight to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horrified but I never thought it was going to be John
who was shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings provided a ``wake-up call'' for many officers who
work at the Capitol, Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep that edge every day, and this was one of
those events that jolted us all out of complacency,'' Nichols said.
``It reminds us that critical incidents can happen at any moment,
any time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nichols said that because of a shortage of funding there
have not been any major new security measures instituted.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said the police will be armed with heavier caliber
weapons, and many of the metal detectors and X-ray machines at the
entrances will be upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has also approved $100 million for an underground
visitors center near the Capitol, but just $2.8 million has been
released so far. Nichols said a visitors center would heighten
security because it would push the screening and entry point to the
Capitol farther away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Weston, who was shot and seriously wounded in the
crossfire, was found to be mentally incompetent to stand trial and
remains in a federal prison in North Carolina. There have been
several court hearings to determine if prison officials can force
Weston to take anti-psychotic drugs that could allow him to stand
trial. Weston has refused the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Those who work at the Capitol say they feel relatively safe,
despite the events last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get paralyzed by what happened,'' Rudy said. ``You
still have to go on and pray that something like this doesn't
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Brown, a Capitol Police officer who arrived at the scene
shortly after the two officers were shot, said she has been extra
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to be on your toes,'' Brown said. ``Sometimes
I feel myself feeling comfortable in my job, and then I'm reminded
of what happened and what I saw. Then I just snap back.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley said he is reminded of the tragedy every time he passes
by the door where the gunman entered _ where the bronze memorial
plaque now hangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are American heroes,'' Moakley said. ``They've taken
their place with George Washington and Abraham Lincoln _ heroes of
another time who used their lives for the benefit of others.''

WHO RAISED THE CONNECTICUT FOR GORE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.H. _ The photos of Vice President Al Gore and New
Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen canoeing down the sparkling
Connecticut River Thursday were scenic and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Gore officials spent the day trying to drown out
questions about who asked the local power company to release 4
billion gallons of damned up water to lift the river level _ as
well as the canoes. The story was first reported in The Washington
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted an official of Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric
saying that it had been asked by the Connecticut River Joint
Commission to open the dam after commission and Secret Service
officials visited the site last Saturday and worried that the vice
president's canoe might run aground. Water levels were unusually
shallow due to a long drought.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore officials Friday said the commission had called them
earlier in the week and asked if they should increase the flow of
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very emphatic that they should not increase the flow
in any way, shape or form for our trip,'' said Chris Lehane, Gore's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service also denied any responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one from the United States Secret Service contacted anyone
or any agency with a request to change the water level,'' said
Ronald Peimer, the resident agent in charge of New Hampshire and
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   And William H. Shaheen, Gore's campaign chairman in New
Hampshire and the husband of the governor, said neither the
campaign nor the governor asked for the extra water.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, environmentalists had been making the request for
more water for weeks, pleading that the river's salmon needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gore's advance team had been counting on a sand bar
in the middle of the river for photographers to take their picture.
The advance workers had paddled down the river on Wednesday,
checking to make sure everything would go swimmingly. On Thursday,
the sand bar had disappeared, a victim of the mysterious water
release.

STILL SOME MYSTERY AS TO WHETHER `X-FILES' WILL GO BEYOND SEVEN
YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ David Duchovny isn't among the millions of
``X-Files'' fans who would like to see agents Mulder and Scully
(Gillian Anderson) quit the platonic thing and get down to some
serious hankpankishness in what is likely to be the show's final
season of new episodes.
</P>
<P>
   So just because Mulder put his hand on Scully's hip when he was
teaching her how to hit a baseball in an episode last season, and
just because the camera lingered ever so suggestively on that
moment, don't go getting any fresh ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my opinion on whether or not Mulder and Scully
should have a romance, I couldn't tell you how uninterested in that
I am, really,'' Duchovny said in a surprise visit to TV critics
assembled in Pasadena, Calif., this week. ``I don't mean to be rude
when I say that, but it's just not interesting to me in any way,
shape or form and, thankfully, it doesn't have to be because I
don't have to write the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Duchovny did write the baseball episode _ ``The
Unnatural'' _ which received an Emmy nomination this week for its
cinematography. But he said Mulder's hand on Scully's hip is
nothing more than familiarity born of a long and close professional
partnership as FBI agents investigating paranormal activity and
government conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're writing for a show that's been going for six
years,'' he said, ``you get to use relationships. You have a
wonderful history upon which to draw, and you'd be an idiot not to
try to use that to your advantage, so I was just able to display
what I thought these characters had.''
</P>
<P>
   What they have is one more season on Fox, if Duchovny and
creator Chris Carter are an accurate gauge. Both have contracts
that expire after this coming season. But because Anderson's
contract runs an extra year, the question just won't die: Could
``The X-Files'' continue as a TV series beyond the 1999-2000
season?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say `never' about anything,'' Duchovny said, ``but
... I'm living my life as if this would be the last year, and I'd
be fine if it were the last year. ... Seven years is a long time to
be doing one show and I have other things to do. But, then again, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate briefing for the critics, Carter said pretty much
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm preparing in every way for this to be the final
season,'' said Carter, who has a new series, ``Harsh Realm,''
joining the Fox schedule this fall. ``I've heard second- and
third-hand that Fox might approach us about taking the show past
the seventh season, so I don't know. But ... I'm looking at these
next 22 episodes as a wrap-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But not necessarily a complete wrap-up. Carter promised that
another ``X-Files'' motion picture will happen. ``It's just a
matter of when,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that, Duchovny suggested there's really no need to tie
up all the loose ends next season. ``I don't think we'll have to
have any kind of end,'' he said. ``You know, we're not going to
blow the place up. ... I imagine the end of the seventh year will
be pretty much as open-ended as the end of every year that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some critics have said the past season of ``The X-Files''
was its weakest, Duchovny doesn't regret his insistence last year
that the show move its production base from Vancouver, B.C., to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe four or five shows that we did were some of
the four or five best shows we've ever done,'' he said. ``(But) we
did some clunkers. We always do.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``We have the kind of show that reaches further,
in terms of story and execution, than any other show on television.
So, when we succeed, we're better than any show on television, and
when we fail, we can be worse than a lot of pretty bad shows on
television.''

SON OF THE GODFATHER PUTS STORY ON SHOWTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(eds: fact box at bottom) 
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bill Bonanno looks like any other businessman in
town from Phoenix for a couple of days: neatly combed gray hair,
sports jacket, wire-framed glasses. You'd never know the dapper and
polite 66-year-old is the son of one of the longest-reigning Mafia
godfathers in history and that he himself spent a dozen years in
prison for charges including mail fraud and income tax concealment.
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno stopped in Los Angeles earlier this month in the middle
of a whirlwind tour to promote his latest piece of business:
``Bonanno: A Godfather's Story,'' a two-part miniseries airing
Sunday and Monday on Showtime. Bonanno wrote the book the movie is
based on and is its executive producer. A lavish production by
television standards, _ filmed partially on location in Italy,
``Bonanno'' follows the prototypical mob boss, Joe ``Bananas''
Bonanno, from his boyhood in the old country to the present day.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bonanno, who himself did jail time, is now 94. He
still lives near son Bill (who prefers that name to his given one,
Salvatore) in Arizona, where he moved his family after World War II
in part to get away from the increasingly tumultuous family
business. Bill Bonanno said his father enjoyed seeing his life
portrayed on screen, though he complained, ``It's not all there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, well, I would've needed six more hours and $10
million more,'' recalled Bill with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much to laugh about in the dark, often violent
``Bonanno.'' But the godfather's son says he thinks it's good ``to
be able to laugh at ourselves.'' He says he's enjoyed the more
lighthearted treatment of the Mafia in such recent TV shows as
HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' and such movies as ``Analyze This,'' with
Robert De Niro playing a comically conflicted mobster in need of a
shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonanno'' treads some controversial ground. Showtime has
attached a disclaimer, making it clear that the events are depicted
according to Bonanno's recollection. It deals, for example, with
the Mafia's purported role in the slayings of John F. Kennedy and
Robert Kennedy. Patriarch Joe Kennedy is shown enlisting the Mafia
to help get JFK elected and is later seen trying to convince JFK
and Bobby to pull back from their assault on the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Joe is felled by a stroke, and the
intermediary between the Mafia and the White House is lost. ``Joe
Kennedy's stroke was the worst thing that could've happened,'' said
Bonanno, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that really gets Bonanno worked up, though, is the
suggestion that ``Bonanno'' perhaps glorifies the crime and
violence of the Mafia. His voice rising slightly, his finger
jabbing the air to make his point, Bonanno says: ``I've traveled
the country for two weeks, showing (`Bonanno') and talking to
people about it. The only people that have said that it glorifies
violence are the media.'' Bonanno adamantly maintains that the
Mafia of old (though not the more recent crop) was bound by a code
of honor.

TAX BILL EXPOSES WEAKNESSES OF MODERATE REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just a few days ago, a group of moderate
Republicans said they adamantly opposed a $792-billion tax cut
because it was far too large. But after the measure passed on
Thursday, many of the same people wore satisfied smiles. Why?
Because they had forced a relatively minor change in the largest
tax reduction bill in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a significant difference here,'' said Rep. Marge
Roukema, R-N.J., who, along with a group of about 10 other
moderates, withdrew their opposition to the bill in the 11th hour,
providing the margin of passage.
</P>
<P>
   But the language the moderates had negotiated did not reduce the
size of the tax cut. Instead, it made a portion of the reduction
contingent on reducing government debt payments, a hastily drawn
provision that has been criticized by many economists as unworkable
and is not expected to survive in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   So while many moderates viewed the episode as sparkling evidence
of their growing stature, most Democrats and even some moderates
saw the concession as illusory. To them, the vote underscored the
moderates' shortcomings, from their fractiousness to their poor
negotiating skills, and showed why the group remains the 98-pound
weakling of the House, in many eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caved,'' said the chief of staff to one moderate
Republican, expressing a position voiced privately by other
moderates. ``It looks bad for all of us moderates because it
diminishes our bargaining power in the future. Nobody takes you
seriously when you take a position and then walk back in.''
</P>
<P>
   To Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., a moderate who voted against the
tax bill, the vote illustrated how discordant the moderates can be.
``When you talk about the Conservative Action Team, they are 99
percent unified,'' he said, referring to a conservative Republican
group in the House. ``When you talk about the moderates, you're
talking about people who are going to disagree 99 percent of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   To the 40 or so moderate House Republicans from the Northeast,
Midwest and California, this was to have been the year they
regained influence over a Republican caucus that has been dominated
by conservatives from the South and West since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After impeachment tarnished the Republicans' image among many
voters and the party lost five House seats last year, many
moderates predicted that the leadership would increasingly turn to
them for guidance in pulling the party toward the center.
</P>
<P>
   Many centrist Republicans also assumed that their influence
would be enhanced by the Republicans' slim majority in the House,
where a swing of just five Republican votes could enable a unified
Democratic minority to pass legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not quite worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates, who led the way in forcing the House leadership to
bring campaign finance reform legislation to the floor last year,
have been far less vocal on the issue this year, with only six
signing a petition requiring a vote. They failed to block passage
of a Republican bill that would make it easier to kill
environmental, consumer-safety and health-care legislation that is
deemed expensive to business. And they were unable to prevent their
leadership from pushing measures to weaken restrictions on gun
ownership during the recent debate over gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere was the limits of the moderates' influence more
clear than on the tax cut bill.
</P>
<P>
   All along, the group had been sharply divided on the issue.
Some, like Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., ardently supported a
deep across-the-board income tax cut. But many others raised
concerns that a large tax cut would take money from other
priorities, like building schools, reducing the debt and shoring up
the Medicare and Social Security systems.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a group of 11 moderate Republicans led by Rep.
Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut introduced a more modest array of
tax cuts worth $100 billion over five years. Within weeks, it
seemed Mrs. Johnson's plan would prevail over a more ambitious
proposal for a 10-percent income tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, to many moderates' surprise and dismay, the
Republican leadership revived the 10-percent plan. Angered that
they had not been consulted about the bill, a group of about 15
moderates vowed to join Democrats in killing it unless it were
scaled back.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following days, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, Rep. Bill
Archer of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and
other Republican leaders pushed the moderates to relent. Over lunch
and in private meetings, Hastert argued that his leadership was on
the line, that the party needed a big tax cut for next year's
elections and that the reduction was almost certain to be scaled
back in negotiations with the White House anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, moderates yielded. Finally, Archer proposed the
tax-cut trigger, causing all but four of the holdouts to rejoin the
Republican fold. The four Republicans who voted against the bill
were: Castle and Reps. Constance Morella of Maryland, Greg Ganske
of Iowa and Jack Quinn from the Buffalo, N.Y., area.
</P>
<P>
   Following the vote, many moderates said they had decided to vote
for the bill because they were convinced that it will be trimmed
back. ``It's not going to be $792 billion, we know that,'' said
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that ``the evidence is all about us'' that moderates
are helping to steer Republican policy this year on issues like
education, Boehlert said, ``I think the moderates' standing has
been enhanced'' by the tax-cut fight.
</P>
<P>
   Several moderates argued that the tax debate was symbolically
important because it showed the leadership must pay attention to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we intend to remain a majority party, we have got to have
Northeast, Midwest so-called moderate Republicans as part of the
consensus building from the beginning, not leaving it up to the
Southern and Westerns to formulate policy and then dragging the
moderates along,'' Mrs. Roukema said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're now at the point where that lesson has been
learned, and we're going to reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But some moderates complained that opponents of the tax cut had
made a tactical blunder in publicly attacking a core Republican
issue. They said the moderates should have fought behind the
scenes, knowing that the leadership would try to force them into
line. In the end, these critics said, the moderates lost twice,
first by looking disloyal, and then by appearing weak.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Morella said she was not disappointed that most of the
moderates had supported the tax cut, since she expects the
President to veto it, forcing Congress to scale it back. But she
said she is worried the entire exercise might damage the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will we have proven?'' she asked. ``That the President
had to force our hands. I'm not sure the Republicans come out
looking that good.''

TIGER STADIUM TAKES HIT FROM THUNDERSTORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ At 4 p.m. Tiger Stadium was being baked by a hot
midsummer's sun from nearly cloudless skies. At 4:43, 4-by-8-foot
steel-plated sections of Tiger Stadium were falling from the skies.
</P>
<P>
   A violent thunderstorm struck the fabled corner of Michigan and
Trumbull Avenues Friday _ a storm several witnesses described as a
mini-twister _ and caused damage to the upper level of Tiger
Stadium behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Two large sections of the facade to the press box crashed down
below, first landing in the upper deck and then falling to the
field near home plate and to the box seats between home and third
base. Three other sections of the facade were loosened and hung
precariously, forcing Tigers officials to delay the start of Friday
night's game between the Red Sox and Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the game was delayed 45 minutes as stadium workers
made emergency repairs. Several sections of upper and lower deck
stands near home plate were roped off for precautionary reasons and
were cleared of fans. The storm also blew out ceiling panels and
caused wires to singe in the press box.
</P>
<P>
   No fans were in the stands at the time of the violent storm and
flying debris. Several Tigers players had been taking batting
practice just before the storm struck the stadium, built in 1912
and scheduled to close in two months, but had taken refuge in the
clubhouse when the storm struck.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the flying debris was clearly visible. A steel
railing in the upper deck had been bent nearly in two after it was
hit by the flying steel-plate facade. The roof to the radio and
television booths, which sits hanging below the second deck behind
home plate, had several dents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' said Ernie Harwell, 81,
the Tigers' legendary broadcaster. ``It was revenge on the
sportswriters, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were in the safety of their clubhouse behind first
base when the storm struck. Red Sox manager Jimy Williams was
recalling his fond memories of Tiger Stadium and memories not so
fond, when his Blue Jays came into Detroit three games up with four
to go at the end of the 1987 season. Toronto lost all four games
and the division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' said Williams, ``I think back to the last week of
'87. Sure, why not?'' Williams added that Steve Avery and John
Smoltz were Michigan youngsters at the time ``and I know they were
at Tiger Stadium and they weren't rooting for us.'' Williams,
Avery, and Smoltz, of course, all eventually ended up in Atlanta on
the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It was just about then that booming thunder could be heard, even
in the Red Sox clubhouse deep inside Tiger Stadium. Within minutes,
word came that the storm had been violent on the field. Several
stadium workers described the winds, which Tiger officials
estimated as high as 60 to 70 mils per hour, as having the
qualities of a mini-twister.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky was green,'' said one witness, a description which
several other witnesses gave. ``And I thought it looked like a
twister because I could see the water on the warning track first
blowing one way and then all of a sudden it was being blown the
other direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Damage occurred outside the stadium, as well. Several portable
tables at souvenir stands were sent flying through the air,
damaging cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers originally called in a crane from 10 miles away to
make repairs but scrapped those plans when workers were able to
make temporary repairs.

A PLACID N.H. CANOE TRIP BECOMES A POLITICAL MISADVENTURE FOR
GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ It was supposed to be a friendly and
photogenic river trip, a chance for Al Gore to be seen in a less
formal setting, paddling a canoe on the Connecticut River.
Reporters were invited along, to describe the sight of the vice
president dressed in khakis and a polo shirt, friend of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his presidential campaign drew complaints from
environmentalists after the local utility poured millions of
gallons of water into the drought-stricken river to raise the level
artificially and keep Gore from the embarrassment of running
aground during the campaign visit Thursday in western New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the vice president, said Friday
that the campaign had not asked for the water level to be raised.
That decision was made by the Connecticut River Joint Commissions,
a group that Gore announced Thursday day would receive a federal
grant to enhance the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was brought to our attention, we specifically asked
them not to do anything out of the ordinary,'' Lehane said.
``Where's the there there? They raised the river and it has no
impact on the environment. It's not our screw-up and nothing bad
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Francis, executive director of the Joint Commissions,
acknowledged giving the order ``in the interest of safety and good
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the incident was another misadventure for the campaign _
and did little to make the candidate look smoother, looser or more
relaxed, which had been the plan. In a series of New Hampshire
campaign events this week designed to display a less formal Gore,
he read Dr. Seuss to preschoolers, shook hands up and down a small
town's Main Street and planned an evening beach party.
</P>
<P>
   The informality of the settings, however, seemed only to
accentuate Gore's natural reserve. His perfectly erect posture held
good on the canoe ride, and even sitting cross-legged on the floor
of a barn Thursday night. He seemed shy shaking hands, and
noticeably low on patter, quietly telling most prospective voters
simply, ``How do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   But if the trip underscored his physical tightness and the
gracelessness of an operation that has had its mishaps, there was
good news for the Gore campaign here: At least among the Democrats
who turned out to hear the vice president, many said that they did
not particularly care if the man looks like he can't dance. A few
added that, as a matter of fact, they may have had all the charm
they can stand in a president for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why anyone calls you wooden,'' an older man in
the crowd told Gore at the party in the barn. ``I think we could
benefit from a man such as you _ intelligent, but with humor,
dedicated. I'm voting for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a little bow _ from the waist, like a man wearing an
invisible neck brace _ Gore said: ``Shucks. I sometimes benefit
from low expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters themselves suggest there may be something to that: They
seemed to listen carefully as he gave detailed answers to questions
on campaign finance reform, the gap between rich and poor,
education, sexual abuse on college campuses and a number of other
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Daniel Thompson, who recently moved to Hanover from
San Francisco, said, ``I came here very much undecided between Gore
and Bradley. But he was so different from what I'd heard reported.
He was very human, humorous, very sincere. He won my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, just as another vice president, Republican presidential
candidate Dan Quayle, cheerfully endures well-intentioned
testimonials that he is really not so dumb, so too does Gore smile
when a supporter at nearly every campaign stop stands to tell the
crowd that the vice president is not THAT stiff.
</P>
<P>
   He has stopped telling those jokes about ``Al Gore is so wooden
that ...'' and seems to be trying to close the perceived charisma
gap between himself and his leading Republican competitor, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up here, generally we are in more informal settings and that's
why he enjoys it,'' said Gore's chief of staff, Ron Klain. ``The
vice president loves to do these kind of things. It's something he
does very well. He's going to a beach party because it's the season
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Old friends are more willing to say the condition now known as
stiffness does trouble Gore, and is the deeply ingrained result of
his upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother, Pauline, taught him the proper way to do things,''
said Chip Forrester, who worked for Gore in Tennessee for four
years and ran his 1990 senatorial re-election campaign. ``She's
very dignified and proper and the formality comes from her.''
</P>
<P>
   Visiting every one of the state's 92 counties at least twice a
year, he said, ``The rest of us were always slouching in the car
and he'd maintain perfect posture the whole time. But where Bill
Clinton was born and probably shook the doctor's hand and asked for
his vote, Al Gore is just shy and has to work to put himself before
the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his Democratic opponent, former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore has
by his own account always found speechifying more of a challenge
than a pleasure. In the past, he has done best in highly structured
forums, like his 1993 debate on NAFTA with Ross Perot, in which he
was perceived as having wiped the floor with his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore seems dubious himself that he can change _ or that he needs
to. ``I'm an introvert,'' he said in a recent interview. ``I'm
probably one of the most introverted people in public life, running
for an office at this level. I think people are used to seeing more
outgoing people running, for this office particularly.'' Asked
whether he tells himself he needs to change, he smirked and said,
``I don't talk to myself that much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire this week, people seemed prepared to cut him a
little slack. Shaking hands on the street in Newport, population
6,500, he drew raucous laughter from one group of women. What had
he said that was so funny? ``I told him he had a great tan,'' one
of them said. ``And he said, `You do, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   The preschoolers at A Kid's Place, where Gore read, ``One Fish,
Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish,'' were even easier to please. One
little boy snuggled up next to him and another said the vice
president sure had ``lots and lots of rhymes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the playground, Gore showed great enthusiasm as he talked
about the scientific studies that indicate how important early
childhood education is. Then he attempted a modified
``Oprah-style'' foray through the crowd, handing the microphone to
one woman and asking her to say why after-school care is important,
and how not having that service would make her feel.
</P>
<P>
   At that evening's party in Hanover, a young man asked him to
talk about the best preparation for a life of public service. He
started slowly, but then became a little bit emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know why you're doing it, and be honest, first with
yourself,'' Gore said. ``Fight hard for the right. Be prepared for
long days and hard work. And know the American spirit will sustain
those who put their heart into it. It is self-government, you know.
We're just human beings, trying to do the best we can.''

`TALKING TRASH' ON THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (Weekly Digital L.A. column) 
(eds: replace (AT) with the computer-age `AT' symbol throughout)  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By DAVID BLOOM 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Century City nightclub, before an enthusiastic if not
oversized crowd, a little convergence experiment took place last
week. Whether Jerry Springer should worry just yet about the
competition is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The event was the corporeal coming-out party for ``Talking Trash
With Lola Pandora,'' a demonstrably trashy talk show that
heretofore has been confined to text-based chats at sponsor
Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   But on July 15, Lola went live and breathing. A stage and couch
were set up, cameras and microphones brought in, and so were live
guests, discussing (in a weirdly appropriate choice, given that
Lola Pandora is certainly not the host's real name) how the
Internet lets you act like someone you're not.
</P>
<P>
   There were the usual set of oddball guests, all volunteers
gleaned from Lola's L.A.-area fan base, including a transvestite,
an aging online Romeo and his newest belle, and a gimpy would-be
dragon/poet.
</P>
<P>
   The live video feed of the talk show was broadcast on Lola's
site, in a small window in one corner of the page as the chat room
conversation scrolled up underneath. Lola fielded questions from
both the live and the online audiences, and even took (after a
couple of false starts) a couple of questions by way of Excite's
new ``voice chat'' service.
</P>
<P>
   Lola, the same cushily built blonde who has been the chat's
anonymous online host, acquitted herself well, if campily, enough.
She said the transition to doing the show before a camera and live
audience wasn't that difficult, given her 20 years of experience as
an actress and singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hosting isn't difficult,'' she said. ``It's just the same
thing I've been doing, but the technical aspect, with the live
audience and the cameras, adds some to the job. But I thrive on
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Lola said she felt like she was ``helping usher in the new
millennium with the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV was big in the '50s, cable was big in the '70s, and the
Internet has been big in the '90s,'' she said. ``Broadband will be
big in the next decade. You can watch Jerry Springer and yell at
the TV all you want and it doesn't do you any good. Here you can
talk back. It's a whole new culture. Pretty soon this will just be
another choice on the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first night of a 10-city tour of live broadcasts of
the show that will run on Tuesdays and Thursdays during the next
month around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It's not yet known whether the live broadcasts will continue
after that, a show spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be a natural for the show to transition to online
broadcasting at some point. After all, Excite just did a corporate
marriage with (AT)Home, the big cable-modem company.
</P>
<P>
   Though the show is basically a low-rent version of the
exceedingly low-class Springer programming (complete with its own
musclebound Bubba the Bouncer), the ability of people to not only
ask questions, but talk to each other online as they're doing so
heralds some new kind of medium.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a high-speed broadband connection so the video can be
larger and smoother, and you have the sort of thing that'll raise
all kinds of ruckus. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
Up the Amazon with a camera &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've written in recent months about how the Internet and digital
technology eventually will allow filmmakers to sidestep the
challenges and costs of film reproduction and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Shoot a film with cheap digital cameras, cut it with a
non-linear editing program sitting on a cheap but powerful
Macintosh G3 or PC, and burn your own DVDs or set up pay-per-views
on high-speed broadband Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   That's the dream anyway, which would allow many independent
filmmakers to get their product to a much wider potential audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a ways from reality, but the possibilities became a
little more real with one of the zillions of expansion
announcements that Amazon.com has been making lately, this one at
the recent Video Software Dealers Association convention in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Amazon's Advantage program will allow filmmakers _ much as
it previously has allowed bands and authors with their music and
books _ to set up a site and sell their films through Amazon. To
access the Advantage program, go to amazon.com and follow the
prompts.
</P>
<P>
   The company only requires that two to five copies of a film be
delivered to Amazon initially, to be kept on hand for fast
fulfillment. That eliminates one big block for budding filmmakers
trying to circumvent the studio system.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon splits revenues 55-45 with the filmmaker, which is
considerably more straightforward than most Hollywood deals.
</P>
<P>
   And the first film to be sold through the new program turns out
to be ``Cameras on Campus,'' a tape of five shorts by students from
the top-notch film school at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything qualifies for the program: Amazon screens
material and could reject a submission based on ``suitability
standards'' that include ``quality, value, subject matter,
production standards and compliance with intellectual property
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   No porn allowed either. And video has to be in NTSC format, and
DVDs in Region 1 format. This business of being your own studio can
be tough. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
We list to serve &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who says nobody writes, or reads, anymore? One look at the
official listserv catalog maintained online by L-Soft International
(at lsoft.com/catalist.html) quickly gives the lie to that
position.
</P>
<P>
   The site automatically catalogs and makes available so-called
listservs, or online mailing lists. If you're looking for a mailing
list devoted to movies or Microsoft or mowing, it's probably here.
In all, the site tracks more than 131,000 listservs, about 25,000
of which are publicly available to join.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say much good about the site's bare-bones search engine
and lack of indexing, but if you have a hankering to find folks of
like mind to share e-mail regarding specific topics, here's a great
place to start.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, listservs are part of what makes e-mail the
underappreciated killer app of the computer age, connecting
communities of mind simply and with relatively little drag on the
overall Internet.
</P>
<P>
   America Online recently put out a press release saying that more
people sent Instant Messages, ICQ notes and e-mail on its system in
a day than the Postal Service delivered in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the art of writing is quite alive, even if it
doesn't come with the sensual experience of dragging pen across
exquisitely textured paper, the ritual of folding and placing a
note in an envelope, the annoyance of finding a place to mail it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
Where the geeks are &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Computerworld reports that the Silicon Valley's Santa Clara
County has 5,400 more single men than women, creating a happy
hunting ground for attachment-oriented females but a dire situation
for their male equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Los Angeles (rated the nation's No. 2 high-tech
center in a recent survey because of the huge entertainment
technology business) has a mismatch the other way, by a whopping
127,000 more single women.
</P>
<P>
   And why would Computerworld, a relentlessly technical trade
publication for information tech managers, care about the dating
lives of its most ardent, if socially unrequited, readers? Because
a lack of companionship might turn into a staff retention problem,
it says.
</P>
<P>
   After putting in years of 18-hour workdays eating pizza and
slugging down Jolt cola while crunching computer code, even geeks
get lonely, the story says.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for managers, however, is that many code warriors
are ``pretty one-dimensional,'' more interested in work than dating
opportunities. Just remember, boys, there's always L.A. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
Cool program of the week &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MetaCreations has come up with a program, Canoma, that
gracefully does something I've not seen before: takes 2-D photos of
a place, extrudes them into three dimensions and stitches them
together into a panoramic space.
</P>
<P>
   The Carpinteria-based company has been making amazing graphics
programs for years, from Bryce 3-D to Soap to the KPT effects
plug-ins for Photoshop that first made founder Kai Krause famous.
</P>
<P>
   Canoma, with the usual MetaCreations over-the-top interface,
could be a boon for Web designers trying to make interesting
graphics out of such things as real estate, catalog goods and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent trade show, MetaCreations was using the program and
scans of a handful of postcards of a famed Italian plaza and clock
tower to create a rotatable 3-D re-creation of the site on screen.
It was just too darned cool.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, go to www.metacreations.com. The program
works on both Mac and Windows. &QL;

PROGRAM OFFERS WOMEN ADDICTS $200 IN EXCHANGE FOR STERILIZATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Minn., Ill., Pa., N.H., S.D., S.C., Wis.,
Mich.)   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The billboards make an unusual offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are addicted to drugs,'' they say, ``get birth control
_ get $200 cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs, which went up recently in neighborhoods in Chicago,
advertise a program that will start here on Monday, intended to
persuade drug-addicted women to get sterilized or get long-term
birth control like Norplant or Depo-Privera. Once the women offer
proof that they have done so, they will be given $200 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Called Crack, for Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity, the
privately-financed campaign is an offshoot of one that began in
California about 18 months ago and appears to be catching on.
Billboards have gone up in Florida and Minnesota. Women in
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan have received money after
taking the required steps, according to the group's Web site,
www.cracksterilization.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago offshoot, which is also distributing fliers at
health clinics, is the first to open other than the program's
headquarters in Anaheim and will be run by a social worker here.
</P>
<P>
   The program has attracted considerable attention. Groups
including Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union
say the tactics coerce poor women whose judgment is clouded by
drugs into doing something they may later regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a bribe for sterilization, and that's improper and
it's wrong,'' said Steve Trombley, the president and chief
executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Chicago. ``It is
troubling that they appear to not care at all about the women and
treating their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crack program was started by a California woman, Barbara
Harris, after she adopted four children from the same drug-addicted
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Here's this irresponsible woman walking around
having babies yearly and she can do that just because she has a
right to get pregnant,''' Ms. Harris said in an interview on
Friday. ``She has no intention of raising them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris tried, unsuccessfully, to get state legislation
passed that would ``make it a crime to have a drug-addicted baby,''
she said. Then she took matters into her own hands and decided to
start paying for sterilization and birth control, figuring it was a
bargain compared with the cost of putting a child in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why spend a million dollars later when you can prevent
something by spending $200 now?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an unorthodox method, the Crack program reflects
broader efforts by states in recent years to penalize women who
behave in ways that could harm their unborn children. Court cases
in 21 states have sought to make it a crime for pregnant women to
abuse alcohol or drugs. In 20 states, those prosecutions have
failed, but in South Carolina in 1997, the state Supreme Court
ruled that a pregnant crack addict was guilty under the state's
child-abuse laws. A similar case in Wisconsin is working its way
through the appellate system.
</P>
<P>
   Three states, South Dakota, South Carolina and Wisconsin, passed
fetal abuse laws last year, either mandating that substance-abusing
pregnant women be forced into detoxification programs or subjecting
them to jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris says she is having no trouble getting private
donations for her work, including one for $5,000 from Dr. Laura
Scheslinger, the conservative radio talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ms. Harris said, her organization has paid 57 women who
have been pregnant a total of 423 times. ``They had 161 abortions
and gave birth 262 times,'' she said. ``Forty of those babies died
and 175 are in foster care.''
</P>
<P>
   The women have to submit documents, like an arrest report, to
show that they are on drugs. After they get the birth control
procedures, usually paid for with government assistance, they send
in written proof.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was Sharon Adams, 38, a former crack addict from the
South-Central section of Los Angeles. Ms. Adams had 14 children and
saw 4 of them die and 9 placed in foster care. Ms. Adams, who had a
tubal ligation through the program, is said she was free of drugs
now and raising her youngest child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I needed to get my tubes tied,'' Ms. Adams said, ``but
the $200 kind of motivated me.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago woman, Marlo Purnell, said Friday she planned to take
advantage of the offer and get Norplant. Ms. Purnell, 31, said she
was a crack addict who has had to give up custody of her five
children, ages 14 months to 10 years. She said she would use the
$200 to ``probably pay some of my bills, like my phone bill,'' and
that she hoped to have more children ``once I get my life
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the program say that its billboards target mostly
minority neighborhoods. Ms. Harris, who is white and runs the
program almost singlehandedly, responds that she could not be
racist, since her husband, a surgical technician, is black and
nearly half of the women she has paid are white.
</P>
<P>
   A larger worry, critics say, is that women may feel coerced into
giving up their ability to have children, and not get any help or
incentive to stop using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you're doing is supporting their drug habit and you're
taking away an important thing from them for when they may get
healthy,'' said Priscilla Smith, deputy director of litigation for
the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the program say they are well aware that the women
may simply spend the money on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what they do _ as long as they get their tubes
tied,'' said Frank Peard, a 70-year-old retiree who helped arrange
for Crack billboards to be put up in Fort Pierce, Fla., and has
contributed $400 to the cause. ``As far as I'm concerned, they
could buy a gun and shoot themselves with it. That's the least of
the evils. The evil is producing these children when they don't
plan to take care of them.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 23 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: IRAN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 383-1, a measure that will
withhold funding to the International Atomic Energy Agency until it
is determined that Iran is not using the money to aid their nuclear
weapons program. Supporters of the bill said Iran is already
capable of creating nuclear weapons, and the U.S. should not help
Iran build up their nuclear weapons program. No one rose in
opposition to the bill. A ``yes'' vote supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday passed, 221-198, an amendment to an embassy
security bill that would restrict the use of funds granted to the
United Nations Populations Fund. The amendment prevents UNPF, which
deals with family planning issues, from using any of the $25
million for abortions. Supporters of the amendment said the program
was important for family planning services and should be supported
in its limited form. Opponents of the amendment said they would
rather not fund the program at all because doing so would indicate
a support for abortions worldwide. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 239-185, a measure to give local
schools more autonomy in spending $2 billion in federal money.
Supporters of the bill said by putting federal funds into one block
grant, schools can better allocate the money where it is needed.
Opponents of the bill said it will undermine efforts to reduce
class sizes by not specifically designating the money for hiring
teachers. A ``yes'' vote favors giving school districts the block
grant.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: TAXES
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 223-208, a bill that would use
part of the estimated $3 trillion budget surplus to reduce income
taxes by 10 percent over the next decade. The $792 billion tax cut
package would ease the so-called marriage tax penalty, phase out
the estate tax, encourage savings and offer deductions to defray
health care and education costs. Supporters said the excess federal
money should go back to the taxpayers and not spent by Washington
lawmakers. Opponents said it was irresponsible to spend the
estimated surplus before it actually exists. Opponents also said
more money should be devoted to saving Medicare and Social
Security. A ``yes'' vote supports the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 379-45, a $266 billion defense
budget that included a funding cut for the production of the Air
Force's F-22 combat plane, keeping it in the research phase.
Supporters of cutting the F-22 funding said money is needed more in
other areas, such as pilot training. Opponents said the F-22 is the
key to maintaining air superiority in the future and keeping it in
the research phase is akin to killing the project. A ``yes'' vote
is in favor of the bill.

FRANK M. JOHNSON, 80, LEGENDARY CIVIL RIGHTS JURIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank M. Johnson Jr., the legendary federal jurist from Alabama
whose historic civil rights decisions led to ostracism,
cross-burnings and death threats but helped to change the face of
the segregationist South in the 1950s and 1960s, died Friday. He
was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fell last week and was hospitalized in Montgomery, Ala.,
but had returned home. He developed pneumonia, and died at home,
said Wayne Greenhaw, a former reporter and a friend of the family.
No details on services had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   The judge set standards in the South and often in the nation on
voting rights, employment discrimination, affirmative action, the
rights of mental patients to adequate care and of prison inmates to
protection from inhuman conditions. But it was his knell for Jim
Crow that was revered and reviled.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone old enough to remember, the terrible images are
indelible: the lynched black men, the firebombed churches, crowds
shrieking hatred, a skirmish line of deputies on the Pettus Bridge
at Selma, Ala., peaceful marchers attacked with cattle prods and
snarling police dogs at Birmingham, Ala., and a defiant Gov. George
C. Wallace of Alabama vowing to stand in the schoolhouse door to
bar black children.
</P>
<P>
   In that turbulent era, with the national conscience tottering
and a few courageous men and women asking Americans to decide what
kind of people they wanted to be, Johnson loomed as a towering
figure _ an uncompromising defender of civil liberties who came to
be known as the federal judiciary's most influential, innovative
and controversial trial jurist.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed by President Eisenhower a year after the
Supreme Court's school-desegregation decision, Brown vs. Board of
Education. Johnson, a Republican in the Democratic South, arrived
on the bench in Montgomery on Nov. 7, 1955, just as the storm of
the civil rights movement was about to break.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, on Dec. 1, Rosa Parks, a black seamstress,
refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white rider,
as required by city law. Her arrest prompted a bus boycott led by
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a 26-year-old minister who had
just moved to Montgomery for his first pastorate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first major ruling was to join the majority on a
three-judge panel that struck down the Montgomery bus-segregation
law as unconstitutional, applying the principle of Brown vs. Board
of Education: that separate but equal facilities were inherent
violations of the due process and equal-protection clauses of the
14th Amendment. He would use that reasoning again and again to
create a broad mandate for racial justice in Alabama and across the
South.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned almost four decades _ 24 years in U.S.
District Court in Alabama and 13 years in an appeals court with
wide jurisdiction in the South _ Johnson ordered the desegregation
of public schools and colleges, parks, libraries, museums, depots,
airports, restaurants, restrooms and other public places, as well
as the Alabama State Police.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 he issued another historic order that allowed King to
lead a 52-mile march from Selma to Montgomery to protest the denial
of black voting rights. He did so after Alabama troopers clubbed
marchers and used tear gas in a spectacle witnessed on television
by a horrified nation, and after President Johnson federalized the
Alabama National Guard to protect the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   When state courts failed to act forcefully to end racial
violence _ as in the case of Viola Liuzzo, a white civil rights
worker from Detroit who was shot to death while riding in a car
with a black man _ Johnson sent the killers to jail on federal
civil rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   His justice was often innovative, even in minor cases. In one,
theft charges were brought against a white man and four black men
that he had hired to help him steal peanuts from a federal
warehouse. The jury acquitted the white man, but convicted the
blacks. Johnson, poker faced, sentenced the black men to 30 minutes
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decisions were legion: He cleared the way for
registering black voters, outlawed poll taxes, struck down state
laws barring blacks and women from jury service, expanded the right
of the poor to court-appointed lawyers, and issued the first court
order for legislative reapportionment in the nation's history,
anticipating the Supreme Court's one-man, one-vote rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark decision, Johnson ordered Alabama to reform its
crowded, understaffed mental hospitals, and detailed the rights of
patients to decent care. Later, he found barbarous conditions in
Alabama's prisons and threatened to close them unless they were
made habitable and safe for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's voluminous, well-researched opinions often spelled
out detailed standards for his reforms, and in some desegregation
and discrimination cases laid out specific quotas, timetables and
goals that he called ``affirmative action.'' He also appointed
overseers to enforce such orders.
</P>
<P>
   To many fellow white Alabama residents, he was a traitor. To
segregationists, he became a despised symbol of federal usurpation
of states' rights. There were mountains of hate mail and scores of
threatening telephone calls. Crosses were burned on his lawn twice.
His mother's home was firebombed, although she was not hurt. For
nearly two decades, federal marshals protected the judge and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Upstaged and outmaneuvered, Gov. Wallace, who had been a law
school classmate of Johnson's at the University of Alabama, called
him an ``integratin', carpetbaggin', scalawaggin', baldfaced
liar,'' and charged that he was trying to take over the executive
powers of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Name calling aside, a national debate developed on whether
unelected federal judges were intruding too much in state affairs
and assuming too many powers of state and local officials. With
appointees of President Johnson overseeing Alabama schools,
prisons, mental hospitals and elections, the news media began
calling the judge the real governor, and some even said his rule
was preferable to that of Wallace.

EAT MY DUST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dusting has always been an exercise in futility:
Sweep your duster across a counter and seconds later a faint coat
of tiny particles drifts back into place.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great excuse to leave all that dust well enough alone.
</P>
<P>
   But Procter &AMP; Gamble is spoiling it for the chore-reluctant
among us by introducing the Swiffer.
</P>
<P>
   This new ``cleaning system'' is basically a dust cloth on a
stick. But rather than simply redistributing dust, the disposable
Swiffer cloths have fibers that create an electrostatic charge,
attracting household soil and trapping it within its web of
microfibers.
</P>
<P>
   You can use the cloths by themselves or attach the cloths to the
sweeper and put that flexible swivel-head to work in hard-to-reach
spots. And when you're done, just toss the cloth.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiffer starter kit _ which includes the sweeper and eight
disposable cloths _ is in stores now, retailing for about $15.
Cloth refills will be sold in eight-, 16 and 32-count packs.

Gift Toppers, a unique gift-wrap doodad that's a combination
greeting card and gift decoration. Made from sheet magnet, each one

package.
</P>
<P>
   Designs range from cute Dalmatian dogs, silly frogs and
gamboling kittens to bathing beauties, celebrating newlyweds, a

to rib those getting a year older _ a vulture sitting on a
tombstone.

BOOK YOUR MOON MISSION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Man on the moon. Impossible. Unthinkable. Incredible.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, 1969, the world watched in awe as Neil Armstrong
stepped foot on the dusty moon surface. Thirty years later, that
amazing accomplishment has trickled down to banter between ordinary
folks intrigued by the possibility of taking that giant leap
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now Frommer's, famed for travel publications, is offering advice
for would-be moon-walkers. New in bookstores is ``Frommer's The
Moon: A Guide for First-Time Visitors,'' by Werner ``Tiki''
Kustenmacher (MacMillan Publishing USA; $10.95).
</P>
<P>
   Kustenmacher, a German pastor and best-selling author who has
been fascinated by space travel since early childhood, abandons the
Frommer's format in this guide. After all, there aren't any hotel
phone numbers to list, and not even American Express is accepted on
the moon. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   But read on, and you'll soon learn, for example, that there's
already a waiting list for moon flights, known as the ``Moon
Register.'' Your stay is likely to last no more than 12 days, the
maximum lunar sojourn currently under consideration. And alcoholic
beverages will not be served in space, so if you're looking for a
party, you might as well stay on Earth.

 UNDATED: of Wallace. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnson insisted that he had intervened only when state and
local officials failed to perform their constitutional duties. ``My
basic philosophy as a trial judge and as an appellate judge is to
follow the law and the facts without regard to the consequences,''
he said once in a rare interview.
</P>
<P>
   And to many, Johnson was a hero. King called him a jurist who
had ``given true meaning to the word justice.'' Time magazine put
his portrait on its cover in 1967 and called him ``one of the most
important men in America.'' In 1980, Bill Moyers devoted two
installments of his television program ``Bill Moyers' Journal'' to
the judge, and said he had ``altered forever the face of the
South,'' and ``earned an enduring place in our history for his
courage and wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, President Carter nominated Johnson to be director of
the FBI. The move was widely acclaimed, but the judge withdrew
after undergoing heart surgery and facing a long recuperation. Two
years later, Carter named him to a seat on the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, three years after Johnson retired with senior judge
status, President Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, saying that his ``unwavering commitment to equality under
law helped dismantle segregation and bring our nation closer to the
ideals upon which it was founded.''
</P>
<P>
   A stern, forbidding figure on the bench, Johnson, _ tall, gaunt,
with chiseled Lincolnesque features _ never raised his voice in
court, and did not wear a black robe or use a gavel, symbols of
authority he said he did not need. He usually worked 11-hour days.
Peering over half-spectacles, the judge, as one lawyer put it,
``looked at you like he was aiming down a rifle barrel.'' But
almost every lawyer who tried a case before him attested to his
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Away from court, the judge drank bourbon, chewed tobacco, went
fishing and played golf, usually at an Air Force base rather than a
country club where he had been shunned. Invitations to dinner were
rare; there were snubs in church and on the street. But he seemed
untroubled by Montgomery's ostracism. He retained a few close
friends, including law clerks, and with a mischievous grin and a
gravelly drawl, he regaled them with the down-home wit of a
back-country storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Minis Johnson Jr. was a back-country boy, and it explained
a great deal about his fierce independence and stoicism. He was
born in the small town of Haleyville, Ala., on Oct. 30, 1918, the
oldest of seven children of Frank and Alabama Long Johnson, who
were farmers and teachers. His father later was a probate judge and
became the only Republican in the Alabama Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson roots were in Winston County, in the remote hills of
northwest Alabama. Long a Republican stronghold, the county
rejected slavery and tried to secede from the state after Alabama
left the Union in 1861. Styling itself as the ``Free State of
Winston,'' it tried to remain neutral in the Civil War, and
eventually sent more men to fight for the Union than the
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went to grade school and two years of high school in
Haleyville, but at his parents' insistence he entered the Gulf
Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Miss. After graduating in 1936,
he worked for a year as a surveyor and married Ruth Jenkins of
Winston County. He then attended a state college and a business
school in Birmingham, studying accounting and bookkeeping, before
enrolling at the University of Alabama as a junior in a prelaw
program.
</P>
<P>
   His wife also was a student at the university, and after
graduating she helped to put him through the university law school
by teaching speech therapy in a high school. One of her pupils was
Lurleen Burns, who later married George Wallace and served as
governor when term limits barred him from seeking re-election.
Johnson, who recalled Wallace as the most politically ambitious of
his classmates, graduated at the top of his law school class in
1943.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Army as a private later that year, was
commissioned as an infantry lieutenant and won a Bronze Star in the
Normandy invasion as a platoon leader in Gen. George Patton's 3rd
Army. Wounded twice in battle, he finished the war as a legal
officer in England and mustered out as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Alabama, he settled in Jasper, went into law
practice and soon had a reputation as an excellent criminal defense
attorney. He also got involved in Republican Party politics. By
1952, he headed Alabama Veterans for Eisenhower and became a state
campaign manager in Gen. Eisenhower's winning presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   His reward was appointment in 1953 as the U.S. attorney for
Northern Alabama. He again quickly established an impressive
record, winning a peonage conviction, for example, against two
white planters who had bribed Mississippi jailers to bind over
black prisoners to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he was appointed U.S. district judge for Middle
Alabama, a lifetime post. At age 37, he was the youngest member of
the federal judiciary, and one of a small group of Southern judges
_ Elbert Tuttle, John Minor Wisdom and J. Skelly Wright, among them
_ who had been backed by Eisenhower's campaign manager and attorney
general, Herbert Brownell. Fair, strong-willed, independent and
sensitive to civil rights issues, these men played major roles in
the social and political transformation of the segregationist
South.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson moved into a spartan Workers Project Administration
courtroom on the second floor of the post office in Montgomery, a
federal outpost that flew the Stars and Stripes rather than the
Stars and Bars that topped the Statehouse seven blocks away. It was
to be his court for the next 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike higher court colleagues, federal district judges are
usually part of the local scene, their appointments traceable to
community involvement and local politics, their professional and
social lives intertwined with the local power structure. But to
Montgomery, Johnson was an outsider, a Republican from upstate who
was out of step with old boy traditions. And he was to remain so.

 UNDATED: remain so. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His first big case was the challenge to Montgomery's bus
segregation law, set off by Rosa Parks. Joining Judge Richard Rives
in a majority opinion, he struck down the law as a violation of
constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, and
cited the Supreme Court's 1954 ban on school segregation.
</P>
<P>
   More than a vindication of King's bus boycott, it was the first
time that Brown vs. Board of Education had been applied to a
non-school case, and it cleared the way for eventual desegregation
of public services across the South. It also became a key to
Johnson's judicial development: If a right applied in one area, he
could apply it in another.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years, as the civil rights struggle unfolded,
Johnson _ alone or as part of three-judge panels _ desegregated
schools, parks, depots, airports, museums, libraries, restaurants,
restrooms and other public places and services. In many of the
decisions, his chief opponent was Wallace, who became an Alabama
state judge in 1958 and governor in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   They collided first in 1959, when Wallace impounded records to
impede black voter registration. The records had been subpoenaed by
the federal Civil Rights Commission, and Johnson threatened to hold
Wallace in contempt unless he released them. Wallace complied, but
in a roundabout way that enabled him to remain publicly defiant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Johnson found a pattern of deliberate discrimination _
trick tests and acts of intimidation _ against blacks in Alabama
voter registration. His remedy was to order the registration of any
black who measured up to the ``least qualified white.'' The formula
became standard in voting cases in the South and was incorporated
by Congress into the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Removing other barriers to voting by blacks, Johnson abolished
Alabama's poll tax, and in 1962 was one of three judges who ordered
the state Legislature reapportioned on a population rather than
geographic basis. It was the first order of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Johnson and Wallace faced off again as thousands of
militant civil rights marchers led by King descended on Selma for a
protest march to Montgomery. Wallace banned the march as a peril to
public safety, and, in scenes televised to the nation, deputies at
the Pettus Bridge attacked marchers with clubs, tear gas and
electric-shock cattle prods.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered both sides to stand down, then pondered
whether to let the march proceed. The risks were high; Wallace
would not guarantee protection. But after the National Guard was
federalized, Johnson gave the go-ahead, calling the right to march
``commensurate with the enormity of the wrongs that are being
protested.'' He added, ``In this case, the wrongs are enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a peaceful march, but the next day one participant, Viola
Liuzzo, was shot and killed. In the ensuing criminal trial, a
Lowndes County jury acquitted three Ku Klux Klansmen, even though
an FBI informant testified that he saw one defendant commit the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The men were later tried on federal charges of violating the
slain woman's civil rights. When the jury declared itself
deadlocked, Johnson, speaking carefully to avoid a mistrial,
exhorted it to try again, saying the evidence could not be clearer
nor the jurors more intelligent and impartial. The men were then
convicted and the judge sentenced them to the maximum term of 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama State Police never had a black trooper until 1972,
when Johnson ordered an end to ``blatant and continuous
discrimination'' and told the state to hire equal numbers of blacks
and whites until blacks made up a quarter of the 650-member force.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Johnson's most important decisions did not involve race.
In 1971, he found horrific conditions in Alabama's mental
hospitals: thousands of warehoused, tranquilized patients, poorly
fed, unbathed for days, living in reeking, overcrowded quarters,
and no semblance of treatment. His sweeping reforms detailed
precise goals for care and treatment, including staff-patient
ratios, and over the next six years he forced mental health budget
increases, from $16 million to $86 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he ruled that 14 residents of an Alabama school for the
mentally ill had been sterilized in violation of their
constitutional rights in the previous decade. He issued strict
guidelines for such sterilizations, including court approval after
hearings in which incompetent people were represented by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Johnson found Alabama's prisons unfit for habitation,
with inmates packed into unventilated cells, exposed to filth and
rampant violence and deprived of adequate food, sanitation and
medical care. ``The state has a right to convict people for
criminal offenses and send them to the penitentiary, but they were
not sent there to be killed through starvation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered broad reforms that included ``three wholesome
and nutritious meals a day,'' ``a bed off the floor,'' and ``one
toilet per 15 inmates.'' Wallace complained that the reforms were
creating a ``hotel atmosphere'' in the prisons, but the judge
retorted: ``The elimination of conditions that will permit maggots
in a patient's wounds for over a month before his death does not
constitute the creation of a hotel atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alabama officials failed to carry out the reforms, Johnson
appointed a receiver to operate the prisons, and by the 1980s
visitors reported dramatic improvements in sanitation, inmate
education and professional standards.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering from the heart surgery that forced him to
withdraw as the nominee to head the FBI, Johnson returned to the
bench. In a widely noted 1978 case, he ruled that Alabama State
University had discriminated against whites in its hiring
practices. It was the first time that a federal court had found a
black institution guilty of bias against whites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he was elevated by President Carter to the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, with jurisdiction in Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. After a court
reorganization, he later sat on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As an appellate jurist, he placed Alabama's mental health system
under a receivership after concluding that the state had failed to
comply with his reform orders. He also joined a decision that
extended constitutional protections to illegal aliens, overturning
$1,000 tuition fees imposed on each undocumented child by the
school board in Tyler, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also joined in reversing a lower court that had banned
44 textbooks from Alabama public schools in a suit by
fundamentalist Christians, who contended that they promoted a
godless, secular humanism. The textbooks _ in history, social
studies and even home economics _ endorsed no views but tolerance,
self-respect, maturity and self-reliance, he found.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who stepped down in 1992, received the American Bar
Association's first Thurgood Marshall Award in 1993, as the person
``who most exemplifies Justice Marshall's spirit on behalf of
protecting civil rights.'' In Montgomery, where Johnson was once a
pariah, the federal courthouse was named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 address, Johnson reflected on an era that had changed
the South. ``The civilizing function of a judge has been defined, I
think, as `the removal of a sense of injustice,''' he said. ``I
have come to the firm conclusion that the American people revere
the concept of justice, and their conscience tells them to obey the
law once they understand what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge is survived by his wife, Ruth, whom he married in
1938; a brother, James Noel Johnson, of Montgomery; and two
sisters, Ellen Ruth Harvill of Montgomery, and Mary Ann Bates, of
York, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   He was the subject of three biographies: ``Taming the Storm: The
Life and Times of Frank M. Johnson Jr. and the South's Fight Over
Civil Rights,'' by Jack Bass (Doubleday, 1993); ``Judge Frank
Johnson and Human Rights in Alabama,'' by Tinsley E. Yarbrough
(University of Alabama Press, 1981), and ``Judge Frank M. Johnson
Jr.: A Biography,'' by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Putnam, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, whose father was assassinated in 1968, went to
Montgomery in 1977 to write about Wallace, but switched subjects
and during a year in Alabama developed a close relationship with
Frank and Ruth Johnson, whose adopted son, Johnny, had died in 1975
at age 28. ``I was awestruck,'' Kennedy said. ``Here was a man who
utterly vindicated my family's central notion that a single man can
make a difference.''

GERE, ROBERTS REUNITE FOR `RUNAWAY BRIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(eds: for use on Sunday, July 25 or later) 
By MARLA MATZER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Though not really a sequel to ``Pretty Woman,''
``Runaway Bride,'' opening Friday, already is being compared to
that blockbuster. It reunites ``Woman's'' two handsome and likable
stars, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere, with director Garry
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woman,'' which came out in 1990, is one of the top-grossing
films of all time. So, what took them so long to get back together?
It wasn't that people hadn't tried _ but the scripts, and the
timing, were just never right till now, said the movie's stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get offered almost any romantic comedy,'' Gere
said, ``but neither (of us) found anything particularly appealing.
... This was a better script (than `Pretty Woman'),'' said Gere.
``There were full-blown characters. The biggest problem with
`Pretty Woman' was, there was no character for me to play. I said
basically, `I don't have to show up, just put the suit out there.'
It took us a while to work out some kind of story for that
character,'' Gere said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romantic comedy is a pretty limited genre,'' agreed Julia
Roberts. ``There are some that I've seen that I've enjoyed but I'm
glad I passed on.'' Actually, viewers may consider this role a
somewhat bold choice for Roberts: Those who've followed her string
of romances are sure to compare Roberts with her character. She's
been engaged several times and broke up with actor Kiefer
Sutherland just days before they were to be married. (She was later
wed, briefly, to singer-actor Lyle Lovett.)
</P>
<P>
   Gere said he was the one who convinced Roberts that ``Bride''
was the right vehicle. ``I told her, `I like this script. Whether I
do it or not, you should do it _ it's perfect for you,' '' recalled
Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, once the deal was nearly done, the two stars could hardly
believe that it was finally going to happen, Roberts said. ``It
made me second guess the script ... I thought if, 10 years later,
Richard and Garry and I were all agreeing on this and we're all
available, then it can't be possible,'' recalled Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, for the first time ever, I had to get a second opinion on
a script, because it was all happening so fast, and it seemed so
perfect. I thought, maybe I'm just caught up in the excitement,''
Roberts admitted. ``I thought, maybe the script isn't that good.
Maybe I just want it to be that good. So, I sent it off to my best
friend (and boyfriend) _ Benjamin Bratt _ and he said, `Yeah, it's
a no-brainer. You have to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gere recalls that, from the moment the duo did their first
read-through of the script together, it seemed like old times.
Snapping his finger, Gere said, ``It was like that. It was like
rolling off a log; the script played into what we did best.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, Gere says, he and Roberts decided to ask
Garry Marshall to direct them again. Marshall quickly agreed.
Hector Elizondo, who was also in ``Pretty Woman'' and a number of
Marshall's other films, was also cast as husband No. 2 to Gere's
ex-wife, played by Rita Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall admits the dynamic had changed significantly since the
making of ``Pretty Woman.'' In 1990, Roberts was a young ingenue
who had just started to gain notice in such pictures as ``Mystic
Pizza'' and ``Steel Magnolias.'' Gere, on the other hand, was a
big-time movie star, with such films as ``American Gigolo'' and
``An Officer and a Gentleman'' on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Roberts was the hotter star. Though Gere has
continued to be a visible and popular actor, at almost 50 he has
matured beyond his sex-symbol zenith. At 31, Roberts has hit her
stride and _ at the $20 million mark _ is the highest-paid actress
in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall recalled working with them the first time around,
contrasting that to how it was this time, now that Roberts has
become a superstar. ``They were really two kids. We celebrated her
22nd birthday on the set,'' recalled Marshall, ``and he was coming
off hit movies ... This time, while we were filming, this list came
out of the Top 25 actresses in the country: Top of the list is
Julia, and down the line is Joan Cusack. That's who I was doing a
scene with this day. So, I said, would the two top 25ers please
come to the set and sit still?''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said shortly thereafter, another list came out that
named Roberts one of the top actresses ``dead or alive'' of all
time. He said with a laugh, ``That kind of thing is intimidating to
some people. Not to me; I knew her before `dead or alive.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts says that time has made her more sure of herself since
she did ``Pretty Woman.'' ``I certainly didn't have the confidence
then ... I would have a wacky idea and then, at the last second,
restrain myself for fear of making a complete idiot of myself in
front of everyone. That's not even a risk I consider any more,''
said Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall helped Roberts and the rest of the cast be wacky; he
said he always likes to keep the atmosphere light, to alleviate
boredom and keep people on the set from feeling awkward around the
stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moviemaking is not the most glamorous thing in the world. It's
tedious and repetitive,'' Marshall said. ``So, we do things like
have parties ... we had a pumpkin-carving party at Halloween, and
made floats (around Thanksgiving).''
</P>
<P>
   On the personal side, Marshall noted that Gere and Roberts both
seem happier and more grounded than they've been in years. Roberts
is involved with actor Benjamin Bratt; it recently was announced
that Gere will have his first child with his girlfriend, ``Law &AMP;
Order'' actress Carey Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Gere also has become a devotee of Buddhism. At an interview, he
wore prayer beads around his neck and a pinkish string around one
wrist, both symbols of his faith. He seems more interested these
days in discussing big, abstract issues _ such as the meaning of
life _ than in analyzing his latest role.
</P>
<P>
   Though Roberts didn't broach the topic, Gere said he definitely
would consider going to the altar again himself. ``I did it once,
and I kind of liked who I was when I was married (to model-actress
Cindy Crawford),'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Could wedding bells be ringing for Gere again soon? He is
turning 50 at the end of August. Asked how he'd spend his birthday,
he quickly responded, with another winning smile, ``Do you think
I'm going to tell !ital!you?!off!'' &QL;

   PASADENA, Calif. _ A day after it racked up 16 Emmy nominations,
``The Sopranos'' hit the highest note in the history of the
Television Critics Association Friday night, taking home four of

<P>
   _ Don't ever ask Chris Carter for directions.
</P>
<P>
   After spending a few news conferences with the creator of ``The
X-Files'' and ``Millennium,'' I'm convinced Carter likes nothing
better than to leave people scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is discussing the format of ``Harsh Realm,'' the new Fox
series taking the place of ``Millennium'' on Friday nights this
fall: ``You'll see different worlds within the world but they will
all be based around the world that you saw, which is a world where
there is no government besides the government that Santiago is
creating, and there is no morality or no God. These people don't
know of the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   Got that?
</P>
<P>
   Me neither.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harsh Realm'' stars Scott Bairstow and D.B. Sweeney as
military men trying to survive a virtual-reality combat simulation
that has been co-opted by a renegade commander named Santiago
(Terry O'Quinn). Their mission is to bring down Santiago without
getting themselves killed. Of course, if they're in a
virtual-reality situation, the obvious question is, can they really
be killed?
</P>
<P>
   Even Sweeney, one of the stars, isn't sure. ``But part of the
fun of the series,'' he said, ``is like, `All right, I think I
understand about 87 percent of this, and I really want to find out
the other 13 percent.'''
</P>
<P>
   But if Carter's track record with ``The X-Files'' is any
indication, the other 13 percent may be forever out there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fox did not provide critics with a preview tape of the new
Jennifer Love Hewitt series, ``Time of Your Life,'' which follows
Sarah Merrin, her ``Party of Five'' character, to a new life in New
York City. The pilot is now being reshot, and producers Chris
Keyser and Amy Lippman say it's because they originally thought
``Time of Your Life'' would be a companion piece to ``Party of
Five'' that seamlessly dealt with ``the next chapter in Sarah's
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Time of Your Life'' will air on Mondays before ``Ally
McBeal,'' so Keyser and Lippman said it made sense to retool the
show as a stand-alone entity.
</P>
<P>
   Two colleagues from north of the border, however, suggested
another reason for the revamp. Having seen pilot tapes sent by a
Canadian distributor before Fox decided changes were needed, they
both said, ``It was awful.''

NEUBERGER BERMAN PREPARING TO GO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., R.I.) (rk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Neuberger Berman LLC, one of Wall Street's last large
private investment partnerships, appears poised to try again to
sell its stock to the public in an offering that analysts expect
will value it at more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which manages $57 billion for wealthy people,
institutions and mutual-fund customers, decided a year ago to go
public but canceled its plans in October after stock market turmoil
depressed the shares of publicly traded asset managers.
</P>
<P>
   Reconsidering the matter, Neuberger Berman's 70 partners will
vote on it after a meeting Monday, when the firm's executive
committee ``will recommended to the principals that they consider
going public,'' said Jeffrey B. Lane, the chief administrative
officer. The final vote could be known by Wednesday or Thursday,
Lane said, after the partners have had a few days to make up their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the firm's about-face, which comes after the
initial public offering in May of Goldman Sachs Group, the big Wall
Street firm that had also canceled earlier plans to go public,
showed the market was firmer for shares of asset managers and
financial services companies than it had been just a few months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace seems to have overcome the queasiness in
pricing that we had run into,'' said Geoff Bobroff, an independent
mutual fund consultant in East Greenwich, R.I. He also pointed to a
deal announced Thursday, in which ReliaStar Financial Corp. agreed
to acquire Pilgrim Capital Corp., a mutual fund and money
management firm, for a ``very robust price'' of $258 million.
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger Berman, which is much larger, is likely to command a
stock market value that is a higher percentage of assets, Bobroff
said. But he noted that while this might be an opportune time to
take a fund company public, there was no certainty that, as the
industry continued to mature, investors who buy fund-company shares
would see returns anything like the gains of the 1980s and early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In February, for instance, Mario J. Gabelli sold 20 percent of
his Gabelli Asset Management to the public for $105 million, but
Gabelli shares still trade 62.5 cents below their $17.50 initial
public offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Neuberger Berman, a storied firm founded 60 years ago by noted
art benefactor Roy R. Neuberger, is best known to the public for
its line of mutual funds, led by its Guardian and Partners funds.
But they are ``value'' investors, and like other fund families that
specialize in such investing, they have suffered somewhat in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular funds with investors lately have been those
that buy growth stocks, particularly technology companies. In
contrast, value-fund managers, who look for out-of-favor shares
that trade at lower price/earnings multiples, have seen investors
withdraw money to reinvest it with rival growth-stock managers, who
captured most of the market's gains. That trend reversed during the
second quarter, but in the past month growth stocks have begun to
outperform value shares again.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, managing money for wealthy people, about $21
billion, has overtaken mutual funds, about $20 billion, as
Neuberger Berman's largest business, according to Lane. Financial
Research Corp., a Boston data gatherer, calculates that investors
have pulled more than $3 billion from Neuberger Berman mutual funds
in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm is still very profitable. In a securities filing
last year, it said its pro forma net income for the first half of
1998 was $72 million on $352.1 million in revenue. For the full
year 1997, it earned $121.9 million in pro forma net income on
revenue of $626.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   In its plan to go public last year, the firm said it would sell
15 percent of its stock for $250 million, using one-fifth of that
to repay capital to partners and the rest for general corporate
purposes, including possible acquisitions.

WARHOL, NADAR SHINE LIGHT ON CELEBRITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(eds: for use Sunday, July 29 or later ... fact box at bottom) 
By REED JOHNSON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They were restless young bohemians, aggressive
social animals with a genius for self-advertisement, eager to make
good in the Big City.
</P>
<P>
   One dropped the ``a'' from his Slovak surname and became Andy
Warhol. The other, Gaspard Felix Tournachon, switched to Gaspard
Tournadar, then to the catchier Nadar.
</P>
<P>
   Both launched their careers as draftsmen _ Warhol as a
commercial illustrator, Nadar as a sharp-eyed caricaturist. Yet
both quickly found their most personalized means of expression
through the camera.
</P>
<P>
   For Warhol, as for Nadar roughly a century before him, the
mechanized aperture of light became a portal into vivid
personalities, a window onto the rapidly changing societies in
which these artists lived and worked, partied and loved.
</P>
<P>
   By their choices of human subjects, Nadar and Warhol each
sanctioned (and partially invented) a new aristocracy, no longer
exclusively based on such archaic criteria as wealth, political
power or moral character. The new elite consisted of artists,
writers, actors, fashion mavens, bon vivants, coffeehouse habitues,
the flamboyantly self-made, the momentarily memorable and the
famous-for-just-being-famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nadar/Warhol: Paris/New York,'' a just-opened exhibition at
the Getty Museum, is intended to be seen on three levels, according
to Getty associate curator Judith Keller, who organized the show
with Gordon Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   First, it's a pairing of extravagant temperaments, of two
multifaceted innovators who settled on photography as their primary
art form.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's an exploration of two cultural milieus: Paris, the
glittering center of 19th-century European culture, home of Victor
Hugo, Sarah Bernhardt, Gustave Dore, George Sand and other imposing
personages; and Manhattan, the cocky, self-styled capital of a bold
new Americanized postwar art world.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in its depiction of so many once-renowned but now
obscure Parisians and formerly celebrated but already
half-forgotten New Yorkers, the show is a meditation on the
impermanence of selfhood in a technological age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to recognize, as Warhol did, that fame is
fleeting, and with the Internet it's probably getting more
transient all the time,'' Keller says.
</P>
<P>
   The show's genesis dates to 1984, when the Getty acquired 350
Nadars by coming into possession of the Sam Wagstaff collection.
Originally, the museum had only one Warhol in its possession. It
since has acquired a dozen more; the rest in the show are on loan,
primarily from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and
the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   After closing in Los Angeles in October, ``Nadar/Warhol'' will
travel to the Andy Warhol Museum then on to the Baltimore Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, Nadar (1820-1910) and Warhol (1928-1987) had both
striking similarities and notable differences.
</P>
<P>
   Championed early in his career by the French poet and critic
Charles Baudelaire, Nadar broke with the portrait painting
conventions of his day by omitting any props or backgrounds that
might divulge his sitters' status or profession.
</P>
<P>
   Like Warhol, he was intrigued by multiple imagery, once
photographing himself from various angles while rotating in a
swivel chair. Warhol, always fascinated with machines, although
mechanics bored him, achieved similar effects by posing sitters
like actress/model Edie Sedgwick and literary critic Lita Hornick
in automated photo booths.
</P>
<P>
   Both photographers made many self-portraits. Nadar once posed
for one of his salt prints dressed as a Plains Indian and wearing a
Louis XIV wig (``Why, nobody knows,'' says co-curator Baldwin).
</P>
<P>
   Warhol, befitting his image as both a pop-art bad boy and a gay
icon, liked to pose in drag or in his platinum fright wig.
</P>
<P>
   Nadar's soft-focus prints draw you to his sitters' expressions,
hinting at their private thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants you to look at these faces,'' Baldwin observes. ``He
wants what he called intimate resemblances.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nadar also could be playful. Look at his print of Dore, the
brilliant young illustrator, with a checkered scarf flung rakishly
around his neck. Did Nadar put it there?
</P>
<P>
   Warhol, an admirer of Edward Steichen's simplicity and hard,
direct lighting, collected cameras by the bagful to take with him
on his ritualized, nightly peregrinations through Manhattan,
wandering from cocktail hour to dinner party to disco.
</P>
<P>
   No after-hours happening really got started until Warhol and his
entourage arrived, and the prints he produced with a Polaroid Big
Shot depict his subjects as if caught off-guard, giving them ``a
kind of Jackie Kennedy/Bambi-in-the-headlights look,'' as Baldwin
puts it.
</P>
<P>
   What Nadar conceived in Paris in the 1850s, Warhol embellished
in New York in the 1960s, gradually blurring the line between
old-fashioned, hard-earned ``reputation'' and superficial,
overnight ``celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In different ways and to differing degrees, both Nadar and
Warhol encouraged the conflation of achievement with mere notoriety
and the erosion of the private self. Today, their works remind us
how fame and glamour are largely modern studio constructions, spun
with darkroom magic and disseminated to the faithful via the
awesome power of the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to feel a creeping sense of irony as you walk
through the Getty's photo galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Working your way past Jane Fonda and Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Truman Capote and Alexandre Dumas, you eventually arrive at
Theophile Gautier (1811-1872), a prolific Parisian author who
cranked out three hefty novels, ballets, poetry, plays, travel
pieces, short stories and reams of literary, theater, music, opera
and art criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Striking a heroic pose, he turns a noble profile toward the
viewer, his eyes fixed as if on some eternal verity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one reads Gautier now, I think, but no one could've been
more famous in Paris in the 1850s or 1860s,'' Baldwin says.
``Arnold Schwarzenegger, everyone knows. But 100 years from now?'' &QL;

SCIENTISTS AND HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 25, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the essence of politics is to be found in the shifting
meaning of words, then few words carry a more interesting charge
these days than ``hacker.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, as one of a series of recent ads, IBM Corp. has
been parading a photograph of employe Nick Simicich, ``Ethical
Hacker.'' Flowing bearded, fish shirted, felt hatted, granny
glassed, Simicich is described as a ``paid professional paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   His job: to determine whether software systems are susceptible
to hackers. His distinction: He protected the electrical power
infrastructure in the United States from ``cyber-jackers bent on
misdirecting electricity with bogus information.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the limits of the current definition of hacker: the
principled tester-of-limits vs. the high-tech saboteur.
</P>
<P>
   But if you listen carefully to the leading innovators in
computer systems, you realize that the applicability of the term is
expanding rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the story of how Linus Torvalds, and not Richard
Stallman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came to pose the
chief threat to the world's first centibillionaire, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman would seem to be the hacker par excellence _ ``the last
true hacker,'' as author Steven Levy called him in a famous book in
1984. Even though it was Harvard College that he entered in 1970,
it was down the street at MIT that Stallman found his spiritual
home. There he imbibed deeply the peculiar sensibility that is one
of MIT's enduring contributions to computer culture.
</P>
<P>
   He rendered a small jewel of a hack of one sort a few years ago
when he posted an official-looking sign on the spot that serves as
the Wellesley terminus of the shuttle bus that has connected
Wellesley College and MIT since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Barbedall Square, it read. At the MIT end of the line, of
course, is Kendall Square. (It helps to say it out loud.)
</P>
<P>
   Such is the world of an MIT hacker: high-spirited, clever,
accomplished, and, just possibly, but not necessarily, oriented to
the occasional countercultural prank. According to Stallman, the
use of ``hacker'' to mean ``security breaker'' is mass media
confusion. Hackers themselves, he says, use the word to mean
``Someone who loves to program and enjoys being clever at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallman's significance goes far beyond a few practical jokes,
however. It was in 1981 that a little start-up company known as
Symbolics Inc. hired away most of the staff of the MIT's Artificial
Intelligence Lab and set them to work writing proprietary software.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time Digital Equipment introduced its new VAX
computers, with brand-new proprietary operating systems. The
community of pioneering software-sharers that had grown out of the
Model Railroad Club at MIT suddenly collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   So Stallman did a historic thing. Instead of joining the
proprietary world, he set set out to make a free, shareable
operating system that would work on any computer and run any
program. There would be none of the non-disclosure agreements that
caracterized the nascent software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman dubbed his ambitious project the GNU system.
</P>
<P>
   But first there would have to be tools. His first big
achievement was EMACS, a compiler and text editor that rendered
possible more ambitious programming. Other programs followed.
</P>
<P>
   All were freely made available to others under the ``copyleft''
license Stallman and his friends devised to keep the underlying
source code open -- that is, to protect the right of others users
to know and modify the basic code.
</P>
<P>
   Stallman's Waterloo was the operating system's ``kernel,'' the
core part of the operating ststem where memory is allocated among
all the other programs: scheduling, signalling, device
input/output, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   When Stallman turned his shoulder to the task in 1990, the dogma
among computer scientists in cutting-edge American universities
such as MIT was that something called a ``microkernel'' would be
required to make a truly portable system. A microkernel would be a
kind of coded general theory of all computer architectures; it
would be required before such a system could run on any hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Helsinki in 1991. A young Finnish graduate student named
Linus Torvalds, comfortably outside the circuits of grant-supported
American computer science research, decided to try an alternative
approach _ a ``monolithic kernel,'' simpler, but far faster and
already relatively well-understood. ``I am a pragmatic person,''
Torvalds has written. ``I didn't have to aim for such a lofty goal.
I was interested in portability between real world systems, not
theoretical systems.''
</P>
<P>
   So Torvalds read up on the systems in use, in search of common
denominators between them. Once he had a design for a certain task
_ for memory management, say _ that would on the most popular
chips, he put it out to an extensive list of correspondent hackers
to see how it could be improved. At first it was written to suit
just one architecture: the Intel 386.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually a kernel emerged that could control the most popular
microprocessors _ the 68K, the Sparc, the Alpha and the Power PC.
Torvalds then combined with a good bit of the GNU programs and his
friends had written, and presto! The operating system that has
become known as Linux _ similar in spirit to AT&AMP;T's Unix system but
not based on it _ was ready to be distributed and more or less
continuously improved.
</P>
<P>
   And because it had been written -- hacked -- by an impassioned
graduate student in Finland and a relentless code warrior in
Cambridge and a few hundred collaborators for their individual
satisfaction and shared use, it was available for others free. And
in the last ten years the project originally envisaged by Stallman
and Torvalds and a handful of others has grown into a credible
threat to Windows NT _ the Microsoft operating system with its
secret proprietary source code on which rests Bill Gates' most
basic hopes for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux today has millions of users, thousand of developers, and
a growing market,'' Torvalds has written in ``Open Sources: Voices
from the Open Source Revolution,'' the O'Reilly &AMP; Associates
anthology from which this account is drawn. ``I'd like to say I
knew this would happen, that it's all part of the plan for world
domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``But honestly this has all taken me a bit by surprise. I was
much more aware of the transition from one Linux user to one
hundred Linux users than the transition from one hundred to one
million.''
</P>
<P>
   And the point? Simply that the neatly barbered and quietly
circumspect Torvalds is every bit as much a hacker as Stallman _ a
fact that the flamboyant Stallman readily concedes.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a hacker, after all? Eric Raymond offers this
definition in the third edition of his New Hacker's Dictionary: ``A
person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and
how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who
prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.'' Torvalds' success
suggests that even that definition may be too narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it was only 150 years ago that thinkers and wordsmiths
of all sorts were trying to agree on a term that could apply
equally to all the different sorts of intellectuals who had emerged
from the precincts of philosopohy and natural history. It seemed
clear these new professionals shared an ethic. Their methods and
goals were unfamiliar and, quite possibly unique. They even
admitted women to their ranks!
</P>
<P>
   In the England of the 1830s, it took a decade before the term
``scientist'' emerged and won common acceptence.

   NEW YORK _ America's two largest stock markets, the New York
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market, are moving quickly to convert
from non-profit institutions to for-profit corporations, with the
New York exchange confirming Friday that it could be ready to sell
shares to the public as early as mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that before people sit down to their Thanksgiving
dinner, they will be able to look up the shares of the New York
Stock Exchange in that day's newspaper and see how they are
trading,'' said Richard Grasso, president of the exchange, in an
interview Friday. The exchange's 1,366 members could be asked to
vote on the historic transformation as early as mid-September,
Grasso said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nasdaq market may not be far behind. Senior market
officials confirmed Friday that the board of Nasdaq's parent
organization, the National Association of Securities Dealers, will
review on Thursday a finely detailed plan that could result in the
Nasdaq market becoming a publicly traded corporation by early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   If the proponents of of the plans are right, these conversions
could produce healthier, better financed, more adaptable American
markets for investors seeking profits and entrepreneurs raising
capital. With new competitors emerging daily and electronic
networks changing the financial landscape, leaders of both markets
emphasized that they must act quickly to preserve their dominant
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden rush to become public companies leaves unanswered
for now some key questions about how to regulate these markets and
contain their near-monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's two premier stock markets are now structured
roughly along the lines of member-owned country clubs _ only the
members in this case are the corporate citizens of Wall Street,
ranging from giants like Merrill Lynch with a commanding presence
in both markets to small independent brokers who own a single seat
on the New York exchange. Like country clubs, these non-profit
institutions cover their expenses by charging fees to those who use
their services, imposing commissions on each trade, annual dues for
each company listed for trading, and separate fees for access to
the stock quotations generated by each market's trading activity.
</P>
<P>
   But just as a country club must balance the interest of the
tennis players who want more courts against golfers who want better
greens, the exchanges are controlled by large cumbersome boards
whose ability to act quickly has been impaired by conflicting
interests among its members.
</P>
<P>
   As corporations with publicly traded stock, Nasdaq and the New
York exchange could more easily acquire complementary businesses,
including upstart networks that are nibbling away at their trading
volume. Moreover, they could generate new profits by developing
proprietary products or forming joint ventures with markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But by adopting a corporate structure, the two markets would
also face the pressures that confront other companies in an age of
low inflation, constant downsizing and aggressive takeovers: the
need to price their services competitively and yet still generate
profits for their demanding and potentially fickle stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of for-profit stock exchanges has already gained
ground in Europe and the Far East. The Stockholm Stock Exchange
became a subsidiary of a publicly traded corporation, OM Gruppa, in
1993. Since then, at least a half-dozen other exchanges, from
Iceland to Singapore, have converted to for-profit status, and two
others, in Toronto and Hong Kong, are studying the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept remains untested in the United States, although
the Chicago Board of Trade and two small regional exchanges _ the
Pacific Coast Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange _ are
also exploring the option.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets are not merely stock-trading businesses, of
course. Since the early 1930s, American stock markets have been
vested with important self-policing responsibilities, noted
Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University. ``To the
extent that you make them for-profit, and especially, that you open
up their ownership to the general public _ boy, that role becomes a
whole lot harder to fill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both Nasdaq and the Big Board already possess enormous
power in the market for the world's stock-trading business. ``The
exercise of that power will be easier when each is a for-profit
entity,'' he said. ``The incentives will be stronger and the
mechanisms more available.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders of America's two major markets have seen upstart
for-profit competitors nibble away at their trading volume over the
past two years. These upstart trading networks can in some cases
offer faster, customized services to powerful institutional
investors and to the burgeoning group of online brokerage
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of proposals, after months of Wall Street
speculation, and the rapid acceleration in the pace of the
discussions reflect the growing certainty among the markets'
leaders that only a corporate structure can give them the ready
access to capital, the ability to make critical acquisitions and
the decision-making speed that they need to a compete effectively
against an increasingly crowded field of new electronic rivals at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you do what we propose,'' a senior NASD official said
of the Nasdaq plan, ``the value of this place diminishes in a
dramatic fashion in a very short period of time.''

ANOTHER VIGIL FOR KURT COBAIN BUT THIS TIME, IT'S A MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH SKIDMORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Movie hopefuls and Nirvana fans sweated it out in
jeans and flannels Friday to be a part of a film re-creation of the
Kurt Cobain memorial vigil at Seattle Center.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was being shot for ``A Leonard Cohen Afterworld,'' a
feature film whose two lead characters end up in Seattle at the
time of the vigil.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial was held on April 10, 1994, on a cloudy day.
Approximately 5,000 people came to mourn the grunge rock anti-hero,
who had committed suicide at his Seattle home.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the sequel wasn't as good as the original.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers had hoped for about 1,500 extras to fill the crowd
scenes. But by early afternoon Friday, only some 700 had arrived.
The sun was shining and people sunbathed while awaiting
instructions. Everyone dressed in the fashion of 1994 and many
carried flowers, candles and signs. Extras were automatically
entered in a raffle for mountain bikes, concert tickets and other
prizes. In exchange, they were asked to stay for approximately six
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The filming was attacked by Cobain's former bandmates, Krist
Novoselic and Dave Grohl, and by the Cobain estate. In a statement
issued through Geffen Records, they said they did not condone the
event ``as a means of binding a narrative to Nirvana's legacy or to
its fans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old story,'' said Novoselic, ``people trying to
exploit everything Nirvana stood for _ and continues to stand for _
just to turn a buck.''
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the estate said the original vigil ``was a
special, sacred event'' aimed at giving participants ``a positive
memory to cling to in the face of tragedy'' and called the
re-creation ``not only an affront to Kurt's memory, but also to all
the fans who legitimately mourned this loss together five years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism dismayed Scott Rosenberg, writer and producer of
the film. He said the movie uses the vigil as ``wallpaper'' and
that it's not about Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had read the script, they would know this is not an
issue,'' Rosenburg said. ``It bums me out, I was a huge fan, and
people say you are in this for the money and nobody is getting rich
off this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, Nirvana fans turned out. Many thought
this was an opportunity to relive the original experience.
</P>
<P>
   Kristi Hamby, 23, was at the original vigil and was inspired by
Cobain to play guitar. She was disappointed by the film version and
said the first vigil was much more intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have to be here,'' she said. ``I was here the
first time and he was very important to me. I feel like I need to
be here for him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamby's friend, Rick Gresham, 20, said he, too, was a big
Nirvana fan and was disappointed by the people posing as devotees.
``There are a lot of preppy people trying to dress grunge, that's
not what Kurt was all about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gresham, an aspiring actor, said he was told to attend the event
by his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Extras were recruited through fliers and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Naab, 17, and Beth Dorenkamp, 17, could not make it to the
original vigil and saw this as a second chance to pay their
respects. Naab owns 23 Nirvana CDs and several Nirvana T-shirts.
Friday, he was wearing a shirt that read: I buy music for minors.
He thought there were many people there who showed up just to be in
the movie, which disappointed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be out here to be around people who feel the
same way I do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Rosenburg said he wanted to address the lives of
Cobain fans in ``A Leonard Cohen Afterworld.'' The two main
characters, played by Jared Leto and Jake Gyllenhaal, are forced
out of their wild Las Vegas lifestyle and follow the dream girl of
Leto's character to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is about finding a home,'' Rosenburg said. ``And a
home can be in the strangest of places or with the strangest of
people. Maybe that's what part of his (Cobain's) problem was, he
hadn't found that.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which has a budget of about $10 million, is due for
release next year.

 NEW YORK: of time.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grasso, at the New York exchange, agreed. ``The landscape is
changing so quickly,'' he said Friday. ``We are competing against
competitors who are publicly owned. We need the potential supply of
capital and the flexibility to have common stock as a script to
acquire other marketplaces or other market entities around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Grasso sent the Wall Street rumor mill into overdrive when he
met privately on Wednesday evening with several hundred exchange
members to brief them on a proposal that he expects to be ready for
the exchange's board of governors the first week in September.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that meeting Friday, he said that the members who
attended were ``very, very supportive and enthusiastic,'' although
there are still key details to be worked out with the help of
Merrill Lynch, which is advising the exchange on a pro bono basis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Grasso, the preliminary plan calls for each seat on
the stock exchange to be converted into two new instruments: the
first could be ``a perpetual trading permit or license, that can be
leased or sold,'' and the second would be common stock in the new
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the exchange would undertake an initial public offering,
selling some quantity of new shares to the public and thereby
offering its founding shareholders _ its seat-holding members _ the
opportunity to sell some or all of their own stake. Among the new
company's assets, besides its potent brand, would be the New York
exchange's existing stakes in several key pieces of Wall Street's
backstage infrastructure, including National Securities Clearing
Corp. and the co-operative organization that sells real-time market
data to the brokerage community.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq proposal, while still a work in progress, is
complicated slightly by the structure of its parent organization,
NASD, which is composed of all of the nation's license securities
dealers. NASD, besides owning the Nasdaq market, also operates the
American Stock Exchange and a separate regulatory and arbitration
unit, called NASD-R.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the Nasdaq proposal said it envisions
selling of the Nasdaq market as a for-profit corporation; upgrading
the electronic backbone of the AMEX with an eye toward taking it
public at some point in future; and retaining the regulatory unit
as part of the parent organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``substantial portion'' of the proceeds of a Nasdaq sale
would then be earmarked to finance the parent organization's
regulatory function, either with an endowment or the purchase of an
annuity.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange, for now at least, is taking a very
different approach to the task of carrying out its self-policing
obligations. According to Grasso, it envisions retaining its
regulatory unit as part of the new corporation.
</P>
<P>
   He has shared details of the plan with Arthur Levitt, chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Grasso said, ``He is
very enthusiastic and supportive, although there are lots of issues
to be explored.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASD has proposed that the markets combine their regulatory
unit into a single free-standing entity, but it poses extremely
complicated issues, he explained. With the current pace of market
competition, he said, ``I cannot spend six to 12 months looking at
how to posture a self-regulatory group.''
</P>
<P>
   But some market experts argue that such questions are too
important to be postponed. ``You have to ask how you regulate them
_ how do you make sure that they have the capacity, the reliability
and processing integrity?'' said Joseph Anastasio, a partner in
Capital Markets Co., an international market consultant. With
public shareholders constantly demanding profit growth, he said,
``what is the incentive to invest beyond the next quarter?''
</P>
<P>
   While he and other market experts agreed that quicker
decision &UR;  &LR; making is essential, they argue that both could
potentially be achieved simply by streamlining the governing
structure of the existing institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But under the structure at the New York exchange, it is so
cumbersome for management to win consensus from all the competing
constituencies that ``the decision &UR;  &LR; making and implementation
process is slowed down,'' said Richard Rosenblatt, whose firm
leases five seats on the New York exchange. ``Something has to
change _ it doesn't have to be the corporate structure, but that is
the easiest way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same conflicts beset the membership of NASD, as well, with
online brokers squaring off against the giant full-service brokers,
and traditional market makers competing against new proprietary
trading services, called electronic communications networks, or
ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   It is less clear whether NASD leadership has the same support
for its proposal that Grasso claims. But one senior market official
said that he believes all NASD members ``want an organization that
can be responsive and competitive _ and one in which they can have
a direct investment, so they can profit from it and be confident
that the organization will be responsive and competitive in the
years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASD board of directors will get a look at the current staff
proposal for privatization when it meets on Thursday in New York,
several board members said. But the NASD leadership believes that
any formal spinoff of the Nasdaq market should be postponed until
after the securities industry has safely navigated the computer
date-change issues that will arise at the end of this year.
``Everybody has a lot on their plate already,'' one market official
said.

CHINA CONTINUES CAMPAIGN AGAINST SPIRITUAL MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-SECT-LI) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A day after it outlawed a fast-growing spiritual
movement, the Chinese government continued its campaign of
invective Friday against the group, known as Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintained a tight cordon of security in central
Beijing, where members of the group had gathered in protest after
the authorities began detaining Falun Gong leaders around the
country Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday morning, police detained about 200 people staging a
sit-in demonstration at Tiananmen Square, according to foreign news
agencies. Police then cleared the square, which was the site of
vast pro-democracy rallies a decade ago, allowing only a line of
people to snake into the Mao Zedong mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police and troops ringed Zhongnanhai, the compound
that houses the Communist Party leaders. However, officials allowed
motor traffic back into a thoroughfare on the western edge of the
compound, where Falun Gong first attracted international attention
with a demonstration on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   The state-controlled news media repeatedly aired a documentary
portraying the group's reclusive founder, Li Hongzhi, as a
charlatan who deceives his followers and harbors a hidden political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The main evening television news program gave prominent play to
footage of President Jiang Zemin inspecting army troops, coinciding
with the release of a statement from the army supporting the
crackdown. The army said it would begin a campaign within its ranks
``to struggle against idealism, feudal superstitions, and
pseudoscientific ideas.''

CRUISE INDUSTRY CONTENDS IT'S MOSTLY SHIPSHAPE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25)

 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been rough going for the cruise industry the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On July 13, Carnival Cruise Line, the world's biggest cruise
line, disclosed in a Miami court that members of its crews had been
accused of sexually assaulting passengers or fellow workers 62
times in the five years ended last August. Then, last Wednesday,
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., the next biggest, pleaded guilty to
21 counts of dumping oil and hazardous chemicals from nine ships in
coastal waters around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The latest admissions, for which Royal Caribbean agreed to pay
an $18 million fine, follow by only two years the company's $9
million fine after pleading guilty to nine counts of dumping _ and
after promising to stop polluting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not surprisingly, many cruise line officials were not
talking last week, said by spokesmen to be busy or otherwise
unavailable for comment. But Cynthia A. Colenda, president of the
International Council of Cruise Lines, took time from a series of
industry meetings in Washington on Thursday to offer the industry's
response to its two recent black eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The council promotes the legislative and regulatory interests of
the foreign-flag passenger cruise ship industry; its 17 member
lines, which include Royal Caribbean and Carnival, carry about 80
percent of all cruise passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Colenda, a lawyer, previously represented the cruise
industry for more than 12 years on Capitol Hill. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has the industry been damaged by all the headlines about
sexual-assault accusations and dumping admissions? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think so, because cruise passengers understand that
this is a very responsible industry that takes all complaints about
passenger safety and the environment seriously. It's not that the
public has been given misinformation, just incomplete information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What hasn't the public been told about the cruise industry? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That our industry is highly regulated. We're subject to the
standards of the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization,
including its fire safety standards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Only a handful of cruise ships are registered in the United
States. What about the others _ do U.S. agencies inspect them? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Lots of agencies do, including the Department of Agriculture
and the Centers for Disease Control. And the Coast Guard not only
inspects our cruise lines' construction plans, it inspects our fire
drills and our crews and it can stop a ship from going out of a
U.S. port if it doesn't meet its standards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there special problems in managing foreign-flag cruise
fleets that sail all over the world and therefore are outside
United States jurisdiction much of the time? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No, because they comply with the same International Maritime
Organization standards adopted by the 135 or so maritime nations.
Our ships call at 200 ports around the world, and even ships that
call here only once or twice a year are subject to international
law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In view of the recent revelations, do you think Congress is
likely to enact legislation tightening regulation of the cruise
industry? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are already plenty of laws out there. Most of the
people in Congress who have jurisdiction over our industry are
aware that it's committed to the environment and to the safety and
security of its passengers. They know we take all these issues
seriously, and they are aware of the measures we've taken. Cruise
ships are pretty much like gated communities, with security
officers on board and in ports, and crime on cruise ships is low.
</P>
<P>
   But we're always looking to improve our procedures, and the
recent news reports have already doubled our members' resolve to
strengthen and improve their policies.

FORMER CHILD STARS REUNITE AND REMINISCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BARBARA DE WITT 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Following the cummerbund trail can get boring.
Every week there's a chicken or salmon dinner attended by the same
politicians and philanthropists to raise money for a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   But the cocktail soiree for A Minor Consideration on July 19 at
the Museum of Television and Radio stepped out of line. There was
no dress code, no silent auction, and the event turned out to be a
TV Land addict's dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of society's A-list, the child stars of all those TV
shows we grew up with _ from ``Lassie'' to ``Dallas'' _ were
gathered for a reunion of sorts. Even that nosy red-haired girl
Margaret (played by Jeannie Russell) from ``Dennis the Menace'' was
there. Still identifiable from reruns, Russell, who now lives in
North Hollywood, said the role was a lot of fun because in real
life she was a very shy child.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Petersen, who played Jeff on ``The Donna Reed Show,'' was
bear-hugging all of his old show-biz pals. But he stopped long
enough to explain that SunAmerica, a retirement savings company,
had joined forces with members of A Minor Consideration, the child
star advocacy organization he organized in 1990, to launch an
outreach campaign that exhorts baby boomers to save more and spend
less.
</P>
<P>
   SunAmerica president Jana Greer explained that with the national
savings rate at its lowest point since the Great Depression, her
company has been looking for innovative ways to appeal to
consumers. ``So we asked Petersen, as well as Brandon Cruz of
`Courtship of Eddie's Father,' and Jon Provost, who played Timmy on
`Lassie,' to help spread the word,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The three former child stars weren't picked for their good looks
or their acting abilities, but because each had suffered from
conspicuous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   According to Petersen, in 1963 while still in his teens, he'd
bought his first house in Beverly Hills, plus a Cobra race car. He
thought his fame and fortune would last forever, but by 1969 he was
out of work and bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   A former Mouseketeer, Petersen said, ``Being rich and famous was
great. The only problem is that at the time, you don't believe that
your career will go away.'' In the end, he took Mickey Rooney's
advice and left town to recover his life and write 16 books.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who lives in Van Nuys with his wife, Liz, and their son,
Lincoln Bixby (named in honor of Cruz's ``Courtship'' co-star, the
late actor Bill Bixby), now works as a film editor for UPN. ``It's
not as much fun as acting, but it's more consistent. However, after
seeing everybody tonight, I'm excited about being in front of the
camera again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, sporting tiny earrings in both ears, still has the impish
grin, and continues to surf at his favorite spots in Topanga and
Oxnard. On the subject of surfing, he recalls once buying 12
surfboards, six wet suits and a first-class ticket around the world
to find the biggest waves _ all in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Provost, who looks incredibly the same as he did on TV _ except
for his new moustache _ now lives in Santa Rosa with his children,
Ryan and Katie, and works in the real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I was lucky enough to quit the show and go to
college, before I was given a pink slip for being too old,''
Provost said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about his years on ``Lassie,'' he commented that in
order to get the part of Timmy, not only did he have to audition,
he also had to live with the dog for a week to get its approval.
``We became great friends and, yes, I got the role,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   And for those fans wondering if he has a collie, the answer's
no. The family dog is a beagle.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending the reunion of sorts was Diane McBain. She
started her acting career at 16 with a small role on ``Father Knows
Best,'' but was best-known for '60s teen angst films such as
``Parrish.'' Said McBain, ``After I was in a lot of bombs, I
actively ran away from the business. I got married, had a family,
and now I'm back.'' The West Hollywood resident says she's got a
new film coming out soon called ``The Path.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the evening was over, Petersen was roasted and toasted by
his peers, and A Minor Consideration received $10,000 from
SunAmerica to continue teaching today's young actors to plan for
their future. &QL;

IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY, THE HOUSE CAN HAVE BAD LUCK, TOO

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25)  
 (af)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Casinos, it is sometimes said, do not really gamble. The odds of
the games insure that over the long run, the house will come out
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not immunize them against nasty surprises in the
short run. Mirage Resorts Inc. shocked Wall Street earlier this
month when it warned that its profit for the second quarter would
be 7 to 10 cents a share, well below expectations of 24 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   The company chalked up 6 cents of that shortfall, an amount
analysts say is equivalent to nearly $20 million in pretax income,
to plain bad luck: Its ``hold percentage'' on table games _ the
money it retains as a percentage of the amount of chips bought _
was only 16.7 percent, instead of the 20 percent it expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed,'' Mirage's chairman, Stephen A. Wynn, told
analysts during a conference call, adding that it was highly
unusual to have three consecutive months of disappointing hold
percentages in all the company's casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Other casino companies have also had unlucky quarters from time
to time. But winnings for Mirage can be particularly volatile,
because it caters to high rollers, gamblers who might bet $100,000
or more on a hand of cards.
</P>
<P>
   The law of averages does not work as consistently for a few
large bets as it does for thousands of smaller ones, and one lucky
weekend for a high roller can cost a casino dearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of gamblers in Las Vegas every year,'' said
Glenn Schaeffer, president of Mandalay Resort Group, once known as
Circus Circus Enterprises. ``But there are only a couple of hundred
that can swing your table results.''
</P>
<P>
   High rollers tend to prefer playing baccarat, and casino
winnings from that card game are so volatile that analysts often
exclude them when assessing industry trends. Month to month over
the last three years, the combined hold percentage for baccarat for
all casinos on the Las Vegas Strip has varied from 4.7 percent to
26.9 percent, according to Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the combined monthly hold percentage for all other
table games varied only between 10.3 and 18.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos have a built-in advantage in the games they offer,
governed largely by the laws of probability, with a few games
influenced slightly by players' skill. On a standard Las Vegas
roulette wheel, for example, the house's advantage is 5.26 percent,
meaning that the casino will come out ahead by an average of $5.26
for every $100 bet.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to the hold percentage _ and casino profits _
than statistical advantages and luck, said Olaf Vancura, director
of gaming products at Mikohn Gaming, a Las Vegas-based developer of
table games. A crucial factor is how long players keep on betting
with their winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos cannot measure directly how much is bet on table games,
so they calculate hold percentages based on how many chips are
sold. A roulette player who bets $100 will have, on average, $94.74
to show for it, given the 5.26 percent house advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But the player is likely to bet all or part of that $94.74
again, and to lose some more. If he bets long enough, the entire
$100 will be exhausted, making the casino's hold percentage for
that player 100 percent, even though the house did not win on every
spin of the wheel. (In actual play, the hold percentage for
roulette tends to run a bit over 20 percent, according to the
Nevada Gaming Control Board.)
</P>
<P>
   The house's statistical edge in baccarat is the smallest of any
game, slightly above 1 percent, said Vancura, who has a PhD in
physics. Yet the baccarat hold percentage on the Strip averages 16
percent, indicating that gamblers play through their chips 10 times
or more.
</P>
<P>
   So could it be that Mirage's problems are more than just an
unlucky turn of the cards? Are its high rollers, lured with free
flights, free meals and free deluxe suites, staying a shorter time
at the Mirage's baccarat tables? Mirage says no.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ader, the casino industry analyst at Bear, Stearns, said
he thinks there has been an overall decline in the hold percentage
for baccarat, because many of the high rollers are Asians who may
be reluctant to endure sustained losses because of financial
turmoil in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Strip's aggregate hold percentage for baccarat did drop to
15.1 percent in 1998, from 17.3 percent in 1997. But the data are
inconclusive: This year through April, the baccarat hold rebounded
to 17.8 percent. And even the low 1998 figure was higher than in
1996, before the Asian crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   Casino executives say they do not concentrate on increasing hold
percentages, but rather on increasing the volume of betting,
because they trust that the casino's winnings will meet
expectations over time. For its part, Mirage said the number of
chips bought by bettors during the unlucky quarter was ``pretty
decent.''
</P>
<P>
   And analysts paid less attention to Mirage's low hold percentage
than to other parts of the company's announcement that suggested it
was not attracting as many customers as hoped, potentially a far
more serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Murren, chief financial officer at MGM Grand, which
recently opened its Mansion _ a complex of deluxe villas for high
rollers _ said that because so much is bet on each turn of the
cards, profit margins from baccarat are often the highest of any
game, making it worthwhile to put up with the volatility of
winnings. ``You don't make that your base level of earnings,'' he
said. ``You make that your gravy.''
</P>
<P>
   Baccarat's impact on earnings is diminishing as casino companies
derive more of their income from rooms, restaurants, shops and
entertainment. When the Hilton Hotels Corp. owned only a few
casinos, its chairman, Baron Hilton, checked the baccarat results
at the Las Vegas Hilton almost every morning, so important were
they to the company's results.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Park Place Entertainment, the gambling spinoff from Hilton
that owns 17 casinos, boasts that baccarat accounts for only 4
percent of its revenue, although the company said last week that
its second-quarter earnings were lower than in the corresponding
period a year earlier, in part because of a decline in baccarat
play.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos are also filling more of their gambling space with slot
machines, for which the calculations are simpler: The hold
percentage for slots is nearly identical to the house's statistical
advantage because the machines count every bet made. Management can
readily adjust the hold up or down by tinkering with the machines'
settings, so the figures contain hints about casino strategy that
could be revealing to gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the house's take on nickel slot machines _ 9.78
percent, on average, on the Strip in 1998 _ is twice as steep as on
dollar machines. Translation: a player has a better chance of
winning at the dollar machines. (But a player is likely to lose
more money in a dollar machine, because the bets are so much
bigger.)
</P>
<P>
   Quarter slots in North Las Vegas, where most of the players are
locals, held 3.23 percent in 1998, less than half the rate of
similar machines on the Strip, where most of the tourists play.
</P>
<P>
   For table game players, the fact that the casino's hold
percentage is much greater than its statistical advantage points to
one rule: The more you play, the more you lose.

CYBILL SHEPHERD GETS A NEW LEASE ON MIDLIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(For use Monday, July 26 or later) 
(eds: note ITALICS below) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a job former teen model Cybill Shepherd never
imagined she'd have: poster girl ... er, poster woman ... for
menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming up with a New York obstetrician-gynecologist and hormone
researcher and a company promoting an herbal alternative to
traditional hormone replacement therapy, Shepherd's ``Say (BEGIN
ITAL)Yes!(END ITAL) to Midlife'' message is simple: The physical
change in a woman's maturing body is not the end of her life.
</P>
<P>
   And the star of a half-dozen movies and two groundbreaking TV
series couldn't set a better example.
</P>
<P>
   In a black, boat-neck top and skinny black pants, flip-flops on
otherwise bare feet, and an absolute minimum of makeup, nobody
could mistake Shepherd, 49, as anything but raring to go. More than
30 years after her blemish-free face appeared on the cover of
Seventeen magazine, her skin is still unlined, her hair flawlessly
blond.
</P>
<P>
   And when she talks about the possibilities the rest of her life
holds, her eyes light up and her grin is wide and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Aging is just what happens when you live long enough, says the
Encino actress and singer, famed for her irreverence and her
outspokenness. She has regrets in her life _ which has included two
ex-husbands and less-than-glowing reviews for some of her early
films _ but none of them has anything to do with getting older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it great to be the right age at the right time to
do this,'' said Shepherd. ``Menopause is not a sickness. It's not a
disease. Doctors don't need to cure you. It's just a part of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we, as women, have to take control of. Women
our age have more power, more knowledge, more education, more money
than women ever did before. Instead of being the end of something,
I see menopause as the beginning of something new and exciting in
terms of who I am. A lot of women don't want to use the word
`menopause.' They say, `I'm not going to ``pause,'' I'm not going
to stop for anything. I've worked so hard to get here, and now I'm
going to enjoy it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It took her awhile to arrive at this conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   For months, all she knew was, boy, was it hot in here! The hot
flashes _ made worse by the hot lights on the set of her 1995-98
sitcom, ``Cybill'' _ were unexpected and unpredictable, but
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, she'd feel as if she'd been plunged into a
sauna. Her face would flush. She'd gasp for cool air and start
shedding garments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so hot, I was dyin','' Shepherd said, rolling her eyes
and flapping her arms as if to generate a breeze. ``I could control
the hot flashes, sort of, by drinking ice water and wearing as
little clothing as possible. But I really didn't understand what
was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, Tenn., where she grew up, ``the change of life'' was
a subject that no lady ever discussed, at least in public. Nobody
had ever explained that when she reached a certain age, her body
would begin to change in preparation for the end of her
childbearing years.
</P>
<P>
   So, Shepherd started to investigate on her own, reading
voraciously about women and midlife. She discovered that, at 49,
she's what doctors term ``perimenopausal'' or ``premenopausal,''
meaning her menstrual periods will likely stop within four to seven
years and she will be unable to bear more children. It set her to
thinking seriously about what she could do to make menopause an OK
thing to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural thing,'' Shepherd said, looking back on her
sitcom about a mature actress that at times went where polite
conversation had never gone before. ``I wanted to do an episode of
the show about it, but the producers said, `Uh, is that really a
good idea?' It made them really nervous. I'd talk about it at
parties, and it would kill the conversation. People would move away
from me.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's not known as outspoken and irreverent for nothing. She
got her way.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 episode, ``When You're Hot, You're Hot,'' her
character, Cybill Sheridan, was having hot flashes, tearing off
clothing in an effort to put out the fire in that internal sauna,
and bemoaning what age was doing to her body while trying to find a
pill or potion that would return everything to normal.
</P>
<P>
   After the episode aired, ``women in airports and restaurants
began to come up to me and tell me their stories about menopause
and hot flashes. Women !ital!wanted!off! to talk about this. And
businesses started sending me their products.''
</P>
<P>
   Hesitant to try just anything, she read that soy, which contains
natural estrogen (called isoflavone phytoestrogen), could cure hot
flashes, and gave it a try _ for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to like tofu _ until I had to eat it,'' Shepherd said,
wrinkling her nose. ``And you have to eat (BEGIN ITAL)so
much(ENDITAL) of it. You can get the same isoflavones from lentils
or chickpeas, but who can eat three cups of lentils or chickpeas a
day?
</P>
<P>
   She was intrigued by a product called Promensil by Novogen,
tablets that contain four plant-based estrogens found in red
clover. She tried it, and after three weeks, her hot flashes had
diminished by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced the product worked, she became a paid spokeswoman for
the little reddish-brown pills.
</P>
<P>
   But in her menopause-awareness campaign, Shepherd's not pushing
the product; she's encouraging women to learn about what's
happening (or about to happen) to their bodies, how to deal with
it, and how to do it gracefully, with no more psychological trauma
than picking out a new pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying all women should be taking this product,''
Shepherd said. ``Women should take whatever's right for them. But I
don't want women to feel bad about themselves, whatever they're
taking.''
</P>
<P>
   When she enters menopause, she may decide to take
doctor-prescribed hormone replacement therapy _ and she may not.
Shepherd wants to investigate more and talk with her doctor before
making that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever she decides, she intends to keep prodding people to
talk more openly about menopause. It's time: About 20 million
American baby boomers have either hit menopause or will reach that
biological milestone in the next six to eight years, according to
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In an article she wrote last year for People magazine, Shepherd
confessed that she'd been afraid since she was a teen-ager of
losing the looks that made her a cover girl and a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I now realize there's another kind of beauty,'' she wrote.
``Instead of being the end of something, menopause began to seem
like the beginning of something in terms of who I was.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice for women entering menopause is to trust your
feelings. Explore. Invest in yourself, whether it be through school
or therapy or church. Believe in yourself, find out who you are.
When I started in this business 30 years ago, nobody believed I
could do what I do today. I did it by sheer not giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Shepherd _ who runs her own production company, River
Siren _ revels in the economic freedom to do pretty much as she
pleases. That includes singing (she's appearing Friday and
Saturday, and Aug. 27 and 28 at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel's
Cinegrill) and writing her autobiography, ``Cybill Disobedience,''
which should be on bookshelves by next spring. And she's spending
lots more time with her 11-year-old twins, Ariel and Zack, and
helping daughter Clementine, 20, plan her wedding later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that midlife, for me, is a great thing,'' Shepherd
said. ``I finally have the freedom to do what I want. What I love
about this period is it's given women in general the opportunity to
give birth to themselves. Maybe we don't want to do what we've
always done. Maybe we want to try something new. It's a very
exciting time to be a woman.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 23 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: IRAN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 383-1, a measure that will
withhold funding to the International Atomic Energy Agency until it
is determined that Iran is not using the money to aid their nuclear
weapons program. Supporters of the bill said Iran is already
capable of creating nuclear weapons, and the U.S. should not help
Iran build up their nuclear weapons program. No one rose in
opposition to the bill. A ``yes'' vote supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday passed, 221-198, an amendment to an embassy
security bill that would restrict the use of funds granted to the
United Nations Populations Fund. The amendment prevents UNPF, which
deals with family planning issues, from using any of the $25
million for abortions. Supporters of the amendment said the program
was important for family planning services and should be supported
in its limited form. Opponents of the amendment said they would
rather not fund the program at all because doing so would indicate
a support for abortions worldwide. A ``yes'' vote favors the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 239-185, a measure to give local
schools more autonomy in spending $2 billion in federal money.
Supporters of the bill said by putting federal funds into one block
grant, schools can better allocate the money where it is needed.
Opponents of the bill said it will undermine efforts to reduce
class sizes by not specifically designating the money for hiring
teachers. A ``yes'' vote favors giving school districts the block
grant.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: TAXES
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 223-208, a bill that would use
part of the estimated $3 trillion budget surplus to reduce income
taxes by 10 percent over the next decade. The $792 billion tax cut
package would ease the so-called marriage tax penalty, phase out
the estate tax, encourage savings and offer deductions to defray
health care and education costs. Supporters said the excess federal
money should go back to the taxpayers and not spent by Washington
lawmakers. Opponents said it was irresponsible to spend the
estimated surplus before it actually exists. Opponents also said
more money should be devoted to saving Medicare and Social
Security. A ``yes'' vote supports the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 379-45, a $266 billion defense
budget that included a funding cut for the production of the Air
Force's F-22 combat plane, keeping it in the research phase.
Supporters of cutting the F-22 funding said money is needed more in
other areas, such as pilot training. Opponents said the F-22 is the
key to maintaining air superiority in the future and keeping it in
the research phase is akin to killing the project. A ``yes'' vote
is in favor of the bill.

<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Like so many of the 40-something men she
works with, Eileen Collins dreamed as a child that she would fly in
space someday. But her dream long seemed little more than that,
because until 1978 little girls could not grow up to be NASA
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed. Today 42-year-old Col. Eileen Collins
was not merely orbiting Earth aboard Columbia, she was in charge _
the first woman to command a shuttle mission. Finally, 38 years
after the first, suborbital flight of a manned Mercury capsule,
space is an equal-opportunity place, where women can do everything
men have done.
</P>
<P>
   Collins _ a wife, a mother and a decorated Air Force pilot _
says it has taken too long. ``I hoped that we would have had a
woman shuttle commander before now,'' the soft-spoken astronaut
said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of two prior shuttle flights, both to the Russian
space station Mir, Collins was at the controls at 12:31 Friday
morning when, on the third attempt this week, Columbia was launched
into orbit with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the 95th shuttle
mission for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Among a throng of VIPs who gathered at the Kennedy Space Center
on Tuesday, and remained for one or more of the attempts at a
launching, were Sally Ride, the first American woman in space
(1983); Kathryn D. Sullivan, NASA's first female space walker
(1984); Hillary Rodham Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea, and the
U.S. women's soccer team. Also in the crowd, for the two earlier
attempts and Friday morning's as well, were Collins' husband, Pat
Youngs, an airline pilot, and their 3-year-old daughter, Bridget
Marie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of her,'' Youngs said after Columbia reached
orbit. ``I'm proud of the whole crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday morning Collins and her crew accomplished the major
goal of the mission, releasing the giant X-ray telescope from the
open shuttle cargo bay with ease. The smooth deployment was no
surprise to her understudy in the cockpit, Jeffrey S. Ashby, a Navy
captain who has spent two years training with Collins and watching
in amazement as she deftly juggles her professional and family
roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the only shuttle commander with baby bottles on her
office desk between the stacks of checklists,'' Ashby said. ``She
has earned the title of commander. She started from a very humble
beginning and worked her way up, and for that I respect her
tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Elmira, N.Y., home to the National Soaring Museum,
Eileen Marie Collins was always drawn to aviation. Her family could
not afford flying lessons for her _ the Collinses lived in public
housing _ so she got a job as a pizza waitress at the age of 16 and
paid for the lessons herself. Awestruck by the Gemini program of
the mid-1960s _ the pre-Apollo effort to determine the effects of
prolonged space flight on humans _ she developed an interest in
space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I subscribed to Junior Scholastic magazine,'' she recalled,
``and read an article called `Pro Versus Con: Should We Spend Money
on the Space Program or Not?' I could not understand why anybody
would say no. It was obvious to me, as a fourth grader, that we
needed to learn about space.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school and community college, she
received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and economics from
Syracuse University in 1978. She then joined the Air Force to fly
bigger and faster planes.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, NASA chose Ride and Sullivan as astronauts, and
Collins realized she could start charting her own course to the
heavens. She completed her pilot training at Vance Air Force Base,
Okla., in 1979 and served there until 1982 as an instructor pilot
in T-38s _ the sleek two-seat training jets that astronauts fly to
maintain their proficiency. She switched to heavy aircraft in 1983,
commanding C-141 transport missions out of Travis Air Force Base,
Calif., and in October of that year took part in the invasion of
Grenada. Then a major, she flew with her crew to the tiny West
Indies island along with 200 members of the Army's 82d Airborne
Division, and flew back with 36 American medical students who had
felt threatened by the growing instability there.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Pentagon policy was not to allow women to fly in
combat zones, ``but some women got through because the mission had
to be done,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   After three years teaching mathematics at the Air Force Academy,
she went back to school herself _ namely, Air Force Test Pilot
School, where she caught NASA's attention in 1989. Not one to leave
much to chance, she had applied for both types of astronaut jobs.
``It really didn't matter to me whether I was selected as a pilot
or a mission specialist,'' she said. ``I think the reason NASA
chose me as a pilot was due to all of my flying experience.'' (She
has spent more than 5,000 hours in more than 30 types of aircraft.)
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence, one of her subordinates in space this week,
Steven A. Hawley, an astronomer-astronaut, belonged to the
committee that interviewed her for the job. ``She impressed us
all,'' he said. When she was chosen in 1990, ``we knew Eileen might
have a chance'' to become the first woman to command a shuttle
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was also the first woman to pilot a shuttle. In 1995,
she flew Discovery to within 30 feet of the Russian space station.
She returned to Mir, to go aboard, in 1997 as pilot of the shuttle
Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, when she was introduced in a White House ceremony
as commander of the current mission, she has tried hard to focus on
her job and not the media attention her gender is bringing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, having women in these roles won't be news
anymore,'' she said. ``It will be accepted and expected. I'm
setting a precedent for women to follow. With that in mind, I want
to do the best job that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who lives with her family in Houston, said she would
not mind if everyone else viewed her achievements the way Bridget
Marie did when the 3-year-old found out that Mom would be
commanding a shuttle mission. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``She proceeded to scream and holler and yell about how happy
she was with that,'' Collins said. ``And then she forgot about it
and went to the next thing.''

<P>
   Bruce Schneider has always dreamed about wine: smooth merlots,
rich chardonnays, complex cabernets. It makes sense, because wine
practically runs through his veins. His grandparents owned a wine
shop in Port Elizabeth, N.J., and his parents ran a wine importing
and distribution business.
</P>
<P>
   But selling wine wasn't enough for Schneider; he wanted to open
his own winery. So, like many entrepreneurs, he wrote a business
plan and presented it to a group of venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Schneider, 29, is about to receive $250,000 to put
into a new operation, Schneider Vineyards in Cutchogue, N.Y., on
the North Fork of Long Island. A fairly standard entrepreneurial
story, except for one thing: the investment came from Columbia
University's Business School, where he is just finishing his
master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented display of faith in their students, business
schools are sponsoring venture capital funds that invest in their
graduates' entrepreneurial endeavors. Columbia's Eugene Lang
Entrepreneurial Fund makes investments of up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Michigan's Wolverine Venture Fund and the
Northwestern University's Goldman/Nice Fund offer up to $50,000
each. And New York University's Stern School of Business and UCLA's
Anderson School of Management have set up similar funds.
</P>
<P>
   The venture funds' money is separate from the schools'
endowments and is provided by donors interested in promoting
entrepreneurship. Any profits go back into the funds, to allow
investments in other entrepreneurs. The schools also hope to gain _
both in future gifts and in the prestige of having successful
alumni.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to encourage entrepreneurship, and we have a strong
belief that the students will do well and that our investment will
rebound with benefit to the school,'' said Morton Kamien, a
professor of entrepreneurial studies at Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1997, the fund at Northwestern's Kellogg
Graduate School of Management has put $150,000 into three
companies, including AIM Technologies, a market research and sports
marketing firm in Austin, Texas. and Outlier, a maker of nylon
backpacks for in-line skaters in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Kamien expects Outlier to net about $10 million in profits
within a few years; to nudge things along, the bags are available
in the Emporium, Kellogg's on-campus store.
</P>
<P>
   The new interest of business schools in providing venture
capital arises from a shift in student attitudes, said Keith Decie,
assistant to the dean at the University of Michigan Business
School. ``Ten years ago the dream was to be the CEO of Procter &AMP;
Gamble,'' he said. ``Today's MBAs dream is to be head of their own
company.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Wolverine Venture Fund, which has about $2 million
available to students, faculty, alumni and staff members of the
university, has invested $50,000 in Intralase, a developer of laser
technologies for eye surgery in Ann Arbor, Mich., and $100,000 in
Centromine, also in Ann Arbor, &UR;  &LR; which markets Web-based software to
mental health organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a risk, just like a venture capital fund,'' Decie
said. ``But we expect to make a return on our investment. This is
not for charity or for fun.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, students applying for funds go through a
rigorous screening process, meeting with faculty advisers, alumni
mentors and other MBA students who evaluate their business plans.
Of course, there are benefits to having your school back your
effort: Mistakes are expected and revisions anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider modified his proposal four times, responding to
comments about legal and strategic issues. ``They weren't all
things that I wanted to hear, but they were all things that I
needed to hear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia, applicants for venture financing must be enrolled
full-time in the MBA program and be the primary force behind their
businesses _ though the ventures may be only in the planning stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to demonstrate that they have the passion and
character to push this business forward,'' said Murray Low,
director of Columbia's Entrepreneurship Program.
</P>
<P>
   The school also looks for businesses ``that will provide a
reasonable career alternative to going out and getting a job,'' he
said. On average, a Columbia MBA graduate's starting compensation
is around $140,000, ``so we're not doing students any service if we
tell them not to take a job and instead start up a chain of hot dog
stands that will only make $40,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is unlikely: most students have loftier goals. AIM recently
expanded its employee roster from 6 to 30 and received a $4 million
investment from Polaris Venture Partners, a Boston-based venture
capital firm. AIM's founders expect Kellogg to get back its
investment, and a profit, in two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to return their money and then some,'' said Todd
Caven, 30, a vice president of AIM.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, who works with his wife, Christiane, plans to create
an advisory board of Columbia Business School alumni and other
business people for his winery, building on the mentoring he has
experienced. ``The process has been invaluable,'' he said. ``It's
an opportunity I wouldn't have gotten in the real world.''

SCIENTIST FAKED DATA LINKING CANCER TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS,
PROBE FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal probe has found that a scientist at the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., faked what had been
considered key evidence of a tie between electromagnetic radiation
and cancer. The disclosure appears to strengthen the case that
electric power is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Robert P. Liburdy, a cell biologist at the laboratory, an arm of
the Energy Department, was found to have published two papers with
misleading data. Investigators said Liburdy eliminated data that
did not support his conclusions. After the investigation, he
resigned quietly from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in March and
has agreed to withdraw his research findings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say his misrepresentations helped him win $3.3
million in grants from the National Institutes of Health, the
Department of Energy and the Department of Defense to investigate a
link between electric power and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Debate has raged for decades over whether power lines cause
cancer even though top scientific groups such as the National
Academy of Sciences have repeatedly found no evidence of danger.
But other researchers say enough tantalizing clues keep emerging to
warrant further investigations of possible links between
electromagnetic radiation and killer diseases, sowing seeds of
anxiety among people living near high-tension power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't gotten these results, nobody would have paid any
attention,'' a federal investigator in the case, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two papers reported data indicating that electromagnetic
fields, also known as EMF, exert a biological effect by altering
the entry of calcium across a cell's surface membrane. The fields
are ubiquitous forms of radiation that arise from all power lines,
home wiring and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say Liburdy's claims were potentially very
important when published in 1992 because they purported to link
electromagnetic fields to calcium signaling, which is a fundamental
process governing many important cellular functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he originally published these papers, there was quite a
bit of interest in it,'' said Woods. ``Now both the lab and the
Office of Research Integrity have found that data on which he based
his conclusions were fabricated. He's been asked to withdraw that
data, and I think he's doing that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his federal settlement, Liburdy has agreed to make no
applications for federal grants for three years and not to contest
the federal findings in administrative proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Liburdy can, however, disagree publicly with the misconduct
findings, and he is doing so vigorously, professing his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics probe of Liburdy began after a whistle-blower
challenged his intriguing results. In July 1995, the Lawrence
Berkeley Lab determined that Liburdy had indeed falsified data, and
it alerted the Office of Research Integrity, an arm of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the integrity office announced its findings in the
Federal Register, saying Liburdy had ``engaged in scientific
misconduct in biomedical research by falsifying and fabricating
data and claims about the purported cellular effects of electric
and magnetic fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in letters sent over the Internet to scientific
colleagues and interested parties, Liburdy has denied that his
research is wrong and said he agreed to the federal settlement only
because he was unable to spend $1 million to mount a legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The raw data for these figures is not challenged, and is
valid,'' Liburdy wrote in one letter. ``How I graphed them is a
matter of disagreement among scientists. Independent scientists
have reviewed this for me and concluded that misconduct is not
warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed that ``none of my scientific conclusions in the
two papers are being retracted,'' only the disputed published data.
</P>
<P>
   Requests for further comments left Friday at Liburdy's residence
in Tiburon, just north of San Francisco, went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Federal experts vigorously disagree with Liburdy's defense and
claims of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a matter of interpretation or graphing,'' said the
investigator. ``This is fabrication and falsification. He can
express his opinion, but not to an appeal board.''
</P>
<P>
   In misconduct cases, especially ones involving large sums of
money, the federal government can bring civil or criminal charges,
and the defendant can be fined and sentenced to jail. In this case,
officials say, they concluded that an administrative remedy was
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the settlement with Liburdy are detailed in the
June 17 Federal Register. The notice says Liburdy ``neither admits
or denies'' the finding of scientific misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say Liburdy did not spend all of the $3.3
million in grant money, and that the remainder is controlled by the
Lawrence Berkeley Lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being used for other science'' and none of it has been
returned to the federal government, Glenn R. Woods, the
laboratory's counsel, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Liburdy's two disputed papers both appeared in 1992, and in both
cases he was the lone author.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, ``Biological interactions of cellular systems with
time-varying magnetic fields,'' appeared in the Annals of the New
York Academy of Sciences. ``Calcium signaling in lymphocytes in ELF
fields'' appeared in FEBS Letters, published by the Federation of
European Biochemical Societies.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Liburdy's research appeared, more than 20
studies have found no hard evidence that electric power causes
cancer, a National Institutes of Health panel concluded recently.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Park, a professor of physics at the University of
Maryland who has long questioned the power-cancer link, said
Liburdy's deception was probably typical for the field, which he
said seems to attract crusaders out to vilify industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often not deliberate fraud either,'' Park said of slanted
data. ``People are awfully good at fooling themselves. They're so
sure they know the answer that they don't want to confuse people
with ugly-looking data.''
</P>
<P>
   In the power line debate, Park added, the proponents of danger
``were desperately looking for a physical effect, and the nearest
they could come by was the calcium signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing consensus among researchers seems to be that
electric power is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a large, meticulously designed study found no
evidence that electromagnetic fields emanating from power lines
cause leukemia in children. The study was a collaboration between
scientists at the National Cancer Institute and childhood leukemia
specialists from the nation's leading medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 636 children with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, the most common childhood cancer, and 620 healthy
children who were matched to the cancer patients by race, age and
residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists tracked the children's exposure to the fields that
power lines produce, but found no relationship between exposure and
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Park said the new findings of power-cancer misrepresentation
will aid the emerging consensuses on safety. ``But I'm not sure how
strongly,'' he added, as other scientists are still investigating
and advancing the idea of a cancer linkage.

WOODSTOCK FESTIVAL OPENS, AND THE LINES AREN'T ALL FOR THE

   ROME, N.Y. _ As James Brown kicked off Woodstock '99 with his
classic refrain of ``get on up,'' 50 ticketholders patiently stood
in line outside the Playstation trailer, waiting to play their
favorite video games for 15 free minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as Brown, sweating and sandwiched by undulating women in
hot pants, got into his signature ``Sex Machine,'' 104 people _
mostly teenagers _ baked in line outside a white tent 500 yards
away, waiting to get their hands on an entirely different kind of
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to e-mail some people to let them know I got here
okay,'' said Melissa Piro, 19, who drove 13 hours from Louisville,
Ky. ``Besides,'' she said in the well-chilled new-media tent,
``there's not any bands that I want to see right now.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200,000 people, even some born before 1969 when the
Woodstock Music and Arts Festival inspired a generation, are here
at Griffiss Air Force Base for Woodstock '99. But this is nothing
like the original, according to fans. Which is fine with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 30 years later _ times have changed,'' Felisa Sgroi, of
Franklin Heights, N.J., said as two naked men walked past a trailer
she was hiding under to escape the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really don't have to fight for peace,'' Ms. Sgroi, 26,
added. ``Well, no, I guess we still do, but a lot of the fights
that were trying to be won in 1969, like women's rights, were
won.''
</P>
<P>
   As a few naked women jumped up from the audience to prance on
stage with Brown, many here were not inspired by the ``Godfather of
Soul,'' wishing instead for contemporary acts like Sheryl Crow and
Bush to take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted to listen to music they know the words to,''
said Kristen Arieno, 21, of Buffalo, sitting on the Griffiss
airplane taxiway, where B-52 bombers once roamed. Like many other
young people baking under Friday's wicked noon sun, Ms. Arieno said
she came to Woodstock '99 for the music, not to stare into a
computer screen. But then again, it was nice to know the Internet,
video games and a bathroom-sized Jimi Hendrix sound booth were only
a few minutes walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid a lot of money to be here,'' she said, ``so they
should have all kinds of stuff to do like the rave and the games.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Sgroi, asked if she felt any hint of the the peace and
love that swept over the 1969 show, shrugged and said, ``No. But
I'm sure there weren't $4 bottles of water on sale at the original
Woodstock, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed if there was any complaint among the crowd here Friday,
it was the relentlessness of the sun, beating down from a nearly
cloudless sky, and the cost of food and drink inside the base. At
Woodstock '99, a slice of pizza cost $6; hot dogs are going for $4.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the better than Saugerties, I think everyone's going
to have a blast,'' said Pete Reineke, 43, of Woodstock, the town,
who brought his 14-year-old son, Nick, to Rome for a father-son
concert weekend of camping and cigar smoking. ``The only thing that
bothered me was the prices. I mean, $4 for a bottle of soda?''
</P>
<P>
   Overflowing toilets in 240-acre Woodstock campground bothered
many other people. ``They're running into the tents,'' said Carol
Tweedie, 23, from Cumberland, R.I., seated beside her tent. ``It's
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Peering across a sea of bare-chested men and women, their flesh
turning redder by the hour, everything else seemed to be as groovy
as could be expected, fans and police said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has died yet at Woodstock '99, though one man from
Brooklyn came close after falling between the rails of a bridge in
Rome, and hundreds on the base have been treated for heat
exhaustion and dehydration. The three crash-resistant gates, as
touted, have repelled all miscreants. Even the Woodstock's e-mail
tent, after an initial power outage Thursday, was up and running by
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the concert, some Rome residents had lost their initial
enthusiasm as Woodstock '99 hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid,'' said Brian Pabis, 21, hawking $1
bottles of unchilled water on Floyd Avenue. ``Businesses are closed
because they have a notion of the kind of people that are coming,
and they're worried about looting and stealing.'' Pabis said he had
canceled two days of tennis lessons at a local country club based
on projections of traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from a faint waft of amplified guitars and reports of
traffic backups elsewhere, a visitor to Rome's empty downtown
streets would hardly know a huge concert weekend had started here.
Like some city officials, Pabis feels a little bit used by
Woodstock organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like they could have done more for Romans, like giving
us a discounted ticket,'' added Pabis, who doesn't plan on seeing
any of the concert. ``Why not? We live here, we have to put up with
this,'' he said, pointing to the stream of cars lined up at one
entrance gate.

MICROSOFT-AOL FEUD ERUPTS OVER INSTANT MESSAGING SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online Friday closed its online service to people using
new software from two of its fiercest rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo,
that had been designed to tap into one of America Online's most
popular features: instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, both Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo introduced software
that could send messages to some 40 million users of AOL Instant
Messaging, a program that enables people to hold ``real time''
dialogs. Unlike standard e-mail, which arrives in a recipient's
in-box to be read only when it is opened, instant-messaging
software places a message in an open window on the recipient's
computer screen only seconds after it is sent.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike e-mail, these systems have until now been closed,
meaning that users of one system cannot connect to users of
another.
</P>
<P>
   AIM is part of the software distributed to America Online's 17
million members, and it is available for free as a stand-alone
product to anyone who takes the time to download the program from
www.aol.com. Many computer manufacturers also install it on all
their machines.
</P>
<P>
   Its widespread use has made it a de facto standard for instant
messaging over the Internet, which is why Microsoft, the world's
biggest software company, and Yahoo, the most heavily trafficked
site on the World Wide Web, designed their software so that it
could interact with AIM. But this is not a simple matter of
adopting the same rules for addressing the messages, because one of
AIM's most popular and useful features is its ``buddy list,'' which
notifies a user when friends or others on the user's list log on to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To determine which users of AIM are online at any given time,
the new products from Microsoft and Yahoo had to blaze a path into
America Online's servers in a way that America Online says violated
its copyrights and trademark
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, America Online blocked both products, as
last month it had blocked a similar product by Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft refused to roll over. Late Friday, the software
giant said it had revised its MSN Messenger program to circumvent
America Online's block. Within hours, America Online answered that
challenge with a new block.
</P>
<P>
   The feud is an odd reversal of the war over Internet browsers
between Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp., which America
Online now owns. Now, Microsoft is arguing that America Online is
using its exclusive technology to prevent fair competition based on
open standards. That is exactly the complaint from Netscape that
prompted the U.S. Justice Department to file an antitrust suit
against Microsoft now being tried in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous because instant messages have become one
of the most popular uses of the Internet, letting users chat
throughout the day with their friends.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   America Online believes so strongly in instant messages that
last year it paid $325 million for a competing instant-message
service called ICQ (for I Seek You), even though it had never
earned a dime of revenue. Today, America Online's two
instant-message services have 80 million users, who send 780
million messages a day, more than all the mail handled in a day by
the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   America Online argues that the programs offered by Microsoft and
Yahoo were inappropriately gaining access to its internal computer
systems without its permission.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, users of both the Microsoft and Yahoo programs are
asked to type in their America Online password, something America
Online discourages. Indeed, one of the most common abuses on
America Online is when hackers pretend to be customer service
representatives and ask innocent users for their passwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are undermining all the efforts that AOL has put into
making an environment that people can trust,'' said Ann Brackbill,
a spokeswoman for the company. Internet executives argued that
America Online is hurting its own users by this policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I demand that all my friends use the same
instant-message system in order to communicate with me,'' said
Steve Glenn, chief executive of People Link, which makes
instant-message software. ``What is right is for consumers to have
a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   There are efforts by an industry consortium to develop a
standard so that Instant messages, like e-mail, can be exchanged
universally. But that standard has not been completed, nor has
America Online committed to comply with it.
</P>
<P>
   In the mean time, Microsoft, which is a latecomer to the
instant-message business, used a technique called reverse
engineering to make its software mimic the behavior of AOL's own
program. This is no different, the company argues, than if it found
a way to make its word processing program read files created by
competing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big benefit for our users if they can speak with
someone on any instant-message system,'' said Deanna Sanford, a
product manager with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo and Prodigy say they didn't need to use reverse
engineering because America Online actually published the
specifications to its instant-messaging system on its Internet site
and authorized other people to link into it.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, America Online did create a version of the
instant-messaging program using the increasingly popular structure
known as open source software, in which programs are published in a
form that users can see how they work and make modifications. The
most popular open source programs are Linux, a rapidly growing
version of the Unix operating system, and AOL's Netscape Navigator
browser which was shifted to open source last year.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said that the only reason it published an open
source version of its instant-messaging program was so that Linux
users could communicate with each other and with their friends who
used AOL's other products. The company said it never intended for
companies to use that version as the basis for a mass market
product.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo and Prodigy said that America Online had clearly made
the instant-message system available for them to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We based our product on the America Online site, which never
once said there were limits as to who this was intended for,'' said
Brian Park, a senior producer at Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kirkner, the chief technology officer of Prodigy, said
America Online was being ``disingenuous'' to cut off that company's
message system after publishing the open source version.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how the Internet works. People build software, and
other people build on it and improve it,'' Kirkner said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that America Online has told Prodigy that it in order to
let its users send messages to AOL users, Prodigy must pay a fee
and use AOL's proprietary AOL messaging software, which carries
advertising that AOL sells.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25)  
 (af)  
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sue Rodin's trip to the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta changed her
professional life. Having watched two of her jobs disappear _ one
in a corporate downsizing and the other after an unsuccessful
spinoff, Ms. Rodin, then 49, was wrapping up a consulting stint
with Avon, a sponsor of the games, and considering starting a
business of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the stands, she watched as American women snared gold
medals in basketball as well as in soccer and softball, two Olympic
events in which women's teams had never competed before. The seats
were filled, she noted, and not just with females.
</P>
<P>
   On the flight back to New York, Ms. Rodin said, she had an
epiphany. ``The whole thing about women's sports kind of
crystallized at that time,'' she said. ``The Olympic experience
reinforced for me that there could be an opportunity if I
specialized in women's sports _ that there might be an opportunity
to make a difference and make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodin is now one of the few sports agents specializing in
representing women. Three of her nine clients are soccer players
basking in the adulation after the American team's victory in the
Women's World Cup _ the co-captain, Julie Foudy; Carla Overbeck,
and Tiffany Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, her first client was Ms. Foudy, whom she signed in
1996. Ms. Foudy said she considered going with a larger agency, but
decided that she did ot want to be a small in a big pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what I like Sue is she is really committed to women's
sports,'' Ms. Foudy said. ``We didn't need to sell her on the idea
that this team was going to be big or that women's soccer was going
to be big.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Ms. Rodin talked on the phone in her modest,
windowless Manhattan office with market executives at Sports
Illustrated for Women, trying to juggle plans for a luncheon with
them on Wednesday with a commitment the same day with Women's
Sports &AMP; Fitness magazine. The previous day, her soccer clients had
met President Clinton, and that night they would appear on ``The
Late Show With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting her female clients was not always an easy sell, Ms.
Rodin allowed, but now ``I'm not necessarily calling people,'' she
said. ``They're calling me.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, manufacturers are mailing her products that they hope
her soccer players will endorse. And she no longer has to spell Ms.
Foudy's name to the people in marketing departments at cosmetics
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the media hoopla over the soccer team's triumph, it has
yet to yield any of the million-dollar endorsement deals that
athletes dream of, and Ms. Rodin still commutes to her office from
Queens, where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   But prospects are improving. According to Ms. Rodin, the soccer
players' speaking fees have already doubled: Ms. Foudy now commands
$10,000 an appearance. And Pepsico, a sponsor since 1996, has
announced it will back the team's fall tour and use Ms. Foudy and
the goalkeeper, Briana Scurry, as spokeswomen for Pepsi-Cola and
Aquafina bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   That deal will earn Ms. Foudy fees ``in the five figures,''
according to Dave DeCecco, a spokesman for Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Rodin has rising hopes for a doughnut deal for Ms.
Foudy. ``She loves doughnuts,'' Ms. Rodin said. ``She's addicted to
doughnuts. Everyone who knows her knows about that.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how successful the soccer stars and Ms.
Rodin's other clients will be at landing the kind of endorsement
deals that enrich male stars like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally televised team sports are a new phenomenon for women.
The Women's National Basketball Association, the first women's
league to win wide attention across the country, was founded only
two years ago. No professional soccer league has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Without continuing exposure on television, a female athlete who
excelled during the Olympics, say, has less luster for advertisers
than a male professional player, said Bob Williams, president of
Burns Sports, a sports marketing company that helps companies sign
athletes for endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   The top male athletes garner endorsement income of $10 million
to $45 million a year, he said, while the leading women draw no
more than $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Schafer, executive vice president with Marketing
Evaluations/TVQ, a company that rates celebrities on their public
appeal, noted that no female athlete has scored in the top 10 since
the firm began conducting surveys on popular athletes in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But women's participation in sports has been rising steadily for
decades, ever since federal law began requiring public high schools
and colleges to spend equally on men's and women's sports programs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are women more interested in sports, but they are
buying more of the merchandise advertisers want to sell. Over all,
women now spend more on sports apparel and athletic shoes than men
do, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, a
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodin, 5 feet 9 inches tall, played softball and basketball
as a teen-ager _ well enough, she thinks, to have played in college
on a scholarship if such things had been available then.
</P>
<P>
   Women's sports have come a long way since her own youth, but Ms.
Rodin has few illusions. ``I think we're making progress, but it
takes a little time economically,'' she said, a bit wearily. ``We
just can't expect to go from ground zero to million-dollar
contracts overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, brightening: ``For once in our lives, we have a
little leverage.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The leader of the fast-spreading spiritual movement
banned this week by the Chinese government said Friday that his
group had no political ambitions and called on the government to
engage in dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get involved in politics ever,'' said Li, who
in 1992 created a cosmic theory and a movement that now says it has
more than 100 million members worldwide. Estimates of the number of
followers in China range from the 2 million given by the government
this week to the tens of millions claimed by supporters, numbers
that cannot be verified.
</P>
<P>
   From his self-imposed exile in New York, Li is embroiled in one
of China's sharpest social rifts in years, as the government tries
to stamp out a movement that has been wildly popular among many
retirees, middle-age women and others, mainly in urban areas around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The government this week described Falun Gong as an illegal
political and social force and Li as an ``evil figure who, by
deceiving, has been seriously disrupting social order.''
</P>
<P>
   Li, a youthful-looking 48, was dressed in a navy blue suit and
spoke in mild terms, becoming most animated when countering
government contentions that he had lied about his past and his
personal gains. He seemed to be anything but the plotting charlatan
portrayed in official Chinese statements this week, or even the
charismatic leader of a new spiritual movement that has spread
quickly in a few years and put the most populous country on a near
crisis footing.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the rapid spread of a movement outside the control of
the Communist Party, China's leaders detained scores of Falun Gong
leaders and mounted a campaign of invective against Li. Subsequent
protests by tens of thousands of followers in at least 30 cities
were dispersed by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't understand what the Chinese government is
doing,'' Li said Friday. ``I think the crackdown is going to do
damage to the state, do damage to human rights and attract the
attention of international public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a state cannot even tolerate a part of its cultural
heritage like qigong, then what can it tolerate?'' he asked,
referring to traditional exercises thought to channel cosmic forces
on which major elements of his own movement are based.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong was developed by Li after decades of study under
various masters, he said in a personal history that the government
disputes. It combines elements of qigong, Buddhism and Taoism. In
Li's formulation, by performing certain physical exercises, people
can harness cosmic forces to improve their health and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The movement takes its name from the falun, the ``law wheel''
that is said to spin in the abdomen, drawing in good powers and
expelling bad forces. Advanced students gain supernatural powers,
his writings suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Many followers in China simply say that they feel better after
having practiced the exercises and that they also enjoy the morning
group exercises as a hobby. It is unclear how many Chinese are
fervent followers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Communist Party is unwilling to tolerate any competing
allegiance. Surprised and shocked in April when 10,000 Falun Gong
adherents held an unauthorized demonstration outside the leadership
compound in central Beijing, the authorities apparently began
planning the crackdown for this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to outlaw the organization then let them do it,''
Li said. ``We don't have an organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Followers insist that volunteers carry out all activities,
teaching neighbors and friends. Li professed Friday to have no
control over the activities of practitioners, who carefully study
his books and speeches for direction in their meditation and
exercise regimens. Critics have likened the group to a cultish
religion, an idea that followers vehemently dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Li has communicated with a spreading worldwide network of
followers through the Internet, where his latest thoughts are often
posted at several sites.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities this week called Falun Gong ``highly
organized,'' with 39 teaching centers, more than 1,900 instruction
stations and more than 28,000 designated exercise spots around the
country. The authorities said Li had amassed large sums of money
from sales of his books and his lectures, had bought cars and
houses through relatives and had ``hoodwinked'' and ``corroded the
minds'' of followers.
</P>
<P>
   Li angrily denied the charges of personal gain as ``sheer
fabrications.'' He also said the authorities had highlighted rare
cases of followers who had committed murders or suicides without
noting that those cases were already mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a proven fact that more than 100 million people have
become healthier by practicing Falun Gong,'' Li said. ``And many
patients with cancer or other terminal diseases are still living
because of this practice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Li was more muted than in his writings about
supernatural powers like X-ray vision, an ability to fly and the
radically lengthened lives that may be achieved through proper
harnessing of cosmic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Li said he felt that the reason for the persecution of Falun
Gong was that so many people had become involved, including many
Communist Party members, and that the growth had made officials
nervous.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Authorities have tried to distinguish publicly between the
``ordinary'' practice of qigong as a health-promoting exercise and
the practice of Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most Chinese loosely believe in the supernatural forces
evoked by various qigong sects. The Communist Party has worked
unsuccessfully to stamp out such beliefs as superstition.
</P>
<P>
   In detailing the case against Li this week, the Chinese
authorities said records showed that he quietly visited Beijing on
April 22, leaving for Hong Kong on April 24, the eve of the giant
demonstration in Beijing by thousands of followers who were
protesting harassment of the group and who called for the group's
official approval.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Li said he had visited Beijing then, but
insisted that the timing was coincidental. He said that he was on a
layover en route to Australia by the cheapest method, and that he
did not meet with any followers and had not known of any
demonstration plans.
</P>
<P>
   Li, his wife and daughter have lived since last year in Queens
in New York City, where they moved from China. They moved in part
because he feared government interference, he said, but more
because his daughter wanted to attend an American high school.

PROGRAM OFFERS WOMEN ADDICTS $200 IN EXCHANGE FOR STERILIZATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct spelling of Schlessinger in 14th graf)   By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The billboards make an unusual offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are addicted to drugs,'' they say, ``get birth control
_ get $200 cash.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs, which went up recently in neighborhoods in Chicago,
advertise a program that will start here on Monday, intended to
persuade drug-addicted women to get sterilized or get long-term
birth control like Norplant or Depo-Privera. Once the women offer
proof that they have done so, they will be given $200 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Called Crack, for Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity, the
privately-financed campaign is an offshoot of one that began in
California about 18 months ago and appears to be catching on.
Billboards have gone up in Florida and Minnesota. Women in
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan have received money after
taking the required steps, according to the group's Web site,
www.cracksterilization.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago offshoot, which is also distributing fliers at
health clinics, is the first to open other than the program's
headquarters in Anaheim and will be run by a social worker here.
</P>
<P>
   The program has attracted considerable attention. Groups
including Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union
say the tactics coerce poor women whose judgment is clouded by
drugs into doing something they may later regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a bribe for sterilization, and that's improper and
it's wrong,'' said Steve Trombley, the president and chief
executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Chicago. ``It is
troubling that they appear to not care at all about the women and
treating their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crack program was started by a California woman, Barbara
Harris, after she adopted four children from the same drug-addicted
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Here's this irresponsible woman walking around
having babies yearly and she can do that just because she has a
right to get pregnant,''' Ms. Harris said in an interview on
Friday. ``She has no intention of raising them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris tried, unsuccessfully, to get state legislation
passed that would ``make it a crime to have a drug-addicted baby,''
she said. Then she took matters into her own hands and decided to
start paying for sterilization and birth control, figuring it was a
bargain compared with the cost of putting a child in foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why spend a million dollars later when you can prevent
something by spending $200 now?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an unorthodox method, the Crack program reflects
broader efforts by states in recent years to penalize women who
behave in ways that could harm their unborn children. Court cases
in 21 states have sought to make it a crime for pregnant women to
abuse alcohol or drugs. In 20 states, those prosecutions have
failed, but in South Carolina in 1997, the state Supreme Court
ruled that a pregnant crack addict was guilty under the state's
child-abuse laws. A similar case in Wisconsin is working its way
through the appellate system.
</P>
<P>
   Three states, South Dakota, South Carolina and Wisconsin, passed
fetal abuse laws last year, either mandating that substance-abusing
pregnant women be forced into detoxification programs or subjecting
them to jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris says she is having no trouble getting private
donations for her work, including one for $5,000 from Dr. Laura
Schlessinger, the conservative radio talk show host.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ms. Harris said, her organization has paid 57 women who
have been pregnant a total of 423 times. ``They had 161 abortions
and gave birth 262 times,'' she said. ``Forty of those babies died
and 175 are in foster care.''
</P>
<P>
   The women have to submit documents, like an arrest report, to
show that they are on drugs. After they get the birth control
procedures, usually paid for with government assistance, they send
in written proof.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was Sharon Adams, 38, a former crack addict from the
South-Central section of Los Angeles. Ms. Adams had 14 children and
saw 4 of them die and 9 placed in foster care. Ms. Adams, who had a
tubal ligation through the program, is said she was free of drugs
now and raising her youngest child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I needed to get my tubes tied,'' Ms. Adams said, ``but
the $200 kind of motivated me.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago woman, Marlo Purnell, said Friday she planned to take
advantage of the offer and get Norplant. Ms. Purnell, 31, said she
was a crack addict who has had to give up custody of her five
children, ages 14 months to 10 years. She said she would use the
$200 to ``probably pay some of my bills, like my phone bill,'' and
that she hoped to have more children ``once I get my life
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the program say that its billboards target mostly
minority neighborhoods. Ms. Harris, who is white and runs the
program almost singlehandedly, responds that she could not be
racist, since her husband, a surgical technician, is black and
nearly half of the women she has paid are white.
</P>
<P>
   A larger worry, critics say, is that women may feel coerced into
giving up their ability to have children, and not get any help or
incentive to stop using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you're doing is supporting their drug habit and you're
taking away an important thing from them for when they may get
healthy,'' said Priscilla Smith, deputy director of litigation for
the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the program say they are well aware that the women
may simply spend the money on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what they do _ as long as they get their tubes
tied,'' said Frank Peard, a 70-year-old retiree who helped arrange
for Crack billboards to be put up in Fort Pierce, Fla., and has
contributed $400 to the cause. ``As far as I'm concerned, they
could buy a gun and shoot themselves with it. That's the least of
the evils. The evil is producing these children when they don't
plan to take care of them.''

WALKER IS A HITTING ARTIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The pitch was at his eyes, the swing was from his
heels, the ball rolled meekly down the line and somehow, Larry
Walker made it safely to first base.
</P>
<P>
   Base hit. Two more percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies all-star right fielder has hit 49 home runs in a
season, but sometimes, it's his 12-foot dribblers down the line
that start the biggest rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so good at putting the ball in play,'' Padres right
fielder and hitting guru Tony Gwynn said. ``If you put the ball in
play, you've got a chance to make something happen. That's what
makes Larry Walker a great hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   If 1998 was the year of the long ball, then a case can be made
that 1999 is the year of the opposite-field single. Three players _
Gwynn, Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken _ are closing in on 3,000 career
hits. Two of the game's greatest hit men, Robin Yount and George
Brett, will be enshrined in the Hall of Fame today. Five players
are hitting above .350.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Walker, who might be the best pure hitter in the
game today _ Coors Field or no Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've figured anything out,'' Walker said.
``I've gotten smarter over the years, I know that. Pitchers,
scouts, they figure you out. Having one strategy won't work here.
You have to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has more ad-libbing skills than an entire improv troupe.
He punches the low-and-away pitch through the left side. He hacks
the high fastball into the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he's being pitched around, which is often, Walker
always seems to find a ball he can drive.
</P>
<P>
   But calling him a bad-ball hitter isn't quite accurate, Colorado
manager Jim Leyland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference, and with Larry Walker, it's about
knowing how far to extend the strike zone,'' Leyland said. ``He
reminds me of Tony Perez in that regard. In an RBI situation, Tony
knew exactly how far he could expand it without swinging at the bad
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that trait, Leyland said, that ability to be simultaneously
discerning and aggressive, that separates mere batters from the
true hitting artists.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake, Walker has the credentials to belong in
that latter class. He hit .363 and won a batting title last year.
He hit .366 and finished second in his MVP year of 1997, narrowly
missing the elusive Triple Crown by four hits and 10 RBI. Entering
the weekend, he was hitting .362, second in the league to Reds
first baseman Sean Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1930, only three players _ Walker, Gwynn and Boggs _ have
put together consecutive years hitting .360 or better. Both Gwynn
and Boggs should reach 3,000 career hits _ the ultimate mark of a
pure hitter _ sometime in August.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has fewer than 1,400, but his plate presence lends you to
believe that if he stays healthy, he will join that club some time
in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He won't deny the obvious _ that playing in Coors Field's thin
air and spacious outfield dimensions inflates his numbers. He'll
hit more homers because the ball carries so well, but he'll also
get more singles to drop in because the outfielders are forced to
play so deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You add up those broken-bat hits, those soft liners that fall
in _ it's a lot of hits,'' Walker said. ``It's what has kept me
above .350. I know I can hit .300 every year, but without Coors
Field, I'd probably be around .310.''
</P>
<P>
   The stats back up his theory. In his last 162 games at Coors
Field, he is hitting .404 with 52 homers and 138 RBI. In his last
162 road games, he is hitting .314 with 34 homers and 101 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the reasons he cheerily signed a six-year, $75
million contract extension in spring training. Why would a pure
hitter want to leave a hitter's paradise?
</P>
<P>
   But more important to Walker was his assurance that Rockies
ownership will be committed to winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win before I'm done,'' Walker said. ``Winning a
batting title last year was nice, but we still sucked. The batting
title didn't get us into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, aside from a cameo as the wild card team in 1995, the
Rockies haven't seriously contended despite high spring training
hopes each year. And though the Rockies aren't looking to trade
Walker, general manager Bob Gebhard is being asked about his
availability daily.
</P>
<P>
   Walker likes Colorado and isn't looking to leave, but he
wouldn't turn his nose up if he was asked to approve a trade to a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy here, but if down the road the Rockies aren't happy
with the way I'm playing or with my production, I'd probably drop
my no-trade clause,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the current trade rumors involving the Red Sox, among
other teams, Walker said there's no validity to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is, I'm in the dark about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many pitchers who try to retire him.

NOTES FROM BOB KEISSER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's regularly-scheduled edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   There are very few things that fans and Dodgers and Angels
players would agree on. But there is consensus on two points: The
umpires suck, and the 1999 schedule was created by a sadist.
</P>
<P>
   Last point first. In an effort to accomodate interleague play
and maximize TV appearances for Fox and ESPN, old scheduling
patterns were discarded and a new one created that only a
contortionist could love.
</P>
<P>
   The longest homestand for the Dodgers this year is nine games --
its already come and gone -- and they have six six-game homestands.
They just completed their third mini-homestand of the season, and
will play their fourth mini-road trip this weekend at Arizona. The
Angels also have five mini-homestands and three mini-road trips
this season.
</P>
<P>
   This is very confusing for those fans who traditionally attend
an average of one game per homestand. For the players, it's extra
wear and tear on players during a 162-game season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball told us they had to do it to make interleague play
work,'' said Dodgers outfielder Gary Sheffield. ``Nobody likes long
road trips. But we get home for a few days and then have to go
right back on the road. It can wear on you''
</P>
<P>
   Some schedule lowlights:
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers twice took three-game road trips, to St. Louis and
Oakland, between a pair of six-game homestands in May. They also
went to Colorado for four games between two three-game home stands.
This week's three-game set against Colorado came between road trips
to Pittsburgh and Arizona. It originally was a two-game set, too,
but a rainout created Thursday's doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a lovely May slate that had them on the road in
the east for nine games, home for three, and then back to the east
coast for six more games. In June, they had one three-game home
stand sandwiched by six- and nine-game road trips.
</P>
<P>
   Add this to the dreaded balanced schedule and you have another
reason for fans to be dubious about baseball's resurgence. ...
</P>
<P>
   Baseball could not have asked for a better solution to their
problems with arrogant umpires than the failed resignation scheme
cooked up by umpire union chief Richie Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball doesn't want to neuter umpires, but they feel too many
umpires are working by their own set of rules -- their strike zone,
their in-your-face argument tactics -- and that some simply aren't
qualified. They want the opportunity to weed those guys out.
</P>
<P>
   The umps certainly won't find any support from fans. The best
umps are still those you don't notice, and fans see way too much
hubris today. ...
</P>
<P>
   If my name was Kevin Malone, and I knew my team was not going to
the postseason, here's the deals I would try to make:
</P>
<P>
   1. I would aggressively shop Ismael Valdes to contenders in
search of a three-player package that would include a pitching
prospect and a quality second baseman, centerfielder, or a
lefthanded hitter who can lead off. The rationale here is that
Valdes has the most value (and a big contract) and that Chan Ho
Park and Darren Driefort will improve.
</P>
<P>
   2. I would let fellow GMs know that Eric Young, Devon White and
Jose Vizcaino are available, that the asking price is a modest
package of prospects, and the club might even be willing to pickup
part of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   3. I would listen to any offers for Gary Sheffield and Eric
Karros on the hunch that someone is willing to overspend. ...
</P>
<P>
   If my name was Bill Bavasi, and I knew my team was not going to
the postseason, here's the deals I would try to make:
</P>
<P>
   1. I would contact about eight contenders and let them know
Chuck Finley is available for two quality prospects, preferably
pitchers. The rationale here is that Finley, like Valdes, is the
kind of player who can put a contender over the top. Plus, he
deserves a chance to win something elsewhere, and is very likely to
return to Anaheim as a free agent next year.
</P>
<P>
   2. I would let the same contenders know that Ken Hill, Omar
Olivares and Tim Belcher are also available, and that the price
will not be as high. The rationale here is that Hill and Belcher
are short-timers, and pitchers like Olivares are easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   3. I would aggressively shop Jim Edmonds and Garret Anderson and
take the best offer for one of them, as long as it returns a
combination of an everyday catcher, natural leadoff hitter or young
pitcher. Darin Erstad would be much more valuable hitting third in
front of Mo Vaughn and Tim Salmon than he is leading off. ...
</P>
<P>
   The memories I have of four Hall of Fame inductees aren't
necessarily what they are best remembered for.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan is memorable as the only Angel ever adored by their
fickle fans. Guys like Reggie Jackson, Jim Fregosi and Tim Salmon
were and are appreciated, but Ryan summoned something deeper in the
fans. This is why Buzzie Bavasi's decision to let him walk is
perhaps the fulcrum moment in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Ryan pitched his first no-hitter in 1973 and his last in
1991, an 18-year gap. Cy Young (1897 and 1908) and Bob Feller (1940
and 1951) are a distant second at 11 years. Ryan also had seven
different catchers, the best known being Jeff Torborg, who also
caught a Sandy Koufax no-hitter, and Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   George Brett's consummate career was also underscored by Angels
fans. He notched No. 3,000 at Anaheim before several thousand,
hardly worthy of his accomplishment. (There is a possibility that
Tony Gwynn will get No. 3,000 in that noted baseball town,
Montreal.)
</P>
<P>
   And Robin Yount predated the vogue trend of teenage pro athletes
by being Milwaukee's starting shortstop at the age of 18. ...
</P>
<P>
   And finally, if World Cup soccer hero Brandi Chastain ever
reports she's being stalked, I'm betting it's David Letterman.

HOUSE PUTS `THREE-MARTINI LUNCH' TAX BREAK BACK ON THE TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Texas, Va.)  (th) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many Americans might remember, if only dimly, the
tax deduction for the ``three-Martini'' business lunch. Now, just
like the Martini, it's making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The far-reaching $792 billion tax cut passed by the House on
Thursday has at its center a 10 percent across-the-board cut in
individual income taxes as well as repeal of the inheritance tax
and cuts in the capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   But like most tax legislation that moves through Congress, it is
also chock full of fiercely sought but little noticed special
provisions for business and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., whose district is the home of the
department store chain Nordstrom, put a measure in the bill
ensuring that retailers get favorable tax treatment on the benefits
they receive from developers as incentives to locate stores in
shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, won an expansion of a provision
giving tax breaks to U.S. companies that export products so that it
now fully covers weapons manufacturers. In 1976 Congress decided
that defense contractors and munitions companies could only get
half the tax breaks allotted to companies that exported other kinds
of goods.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the expansion of the business meal credit,
which waxes and wanes in favor _ much like the Martini itself.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, President Jimmy Carter took aim at what he
dubbed the taxpayer subsidized ``three-martini lunch.'' Carter
administration officials said it was unjustified for the government
to be subsidizing lavish business meals. But they did not prevail
against the cherished tax break.
</P>
<P>
   It took until 1986, when the last major simplification of the
tax code was passed, to reduce the write-off from 100 percent to 80
percent for what was then called the ``two-martini lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's deficit reduction bill of 1993 went one step
further, cutting the deduction back to 50 percent of a
business-related meal _ at an estimated savings to the government
of $15.3 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, the National Restaurant Association has
been pushing for the restoration, at least in the case of small
business. And buried in the small print of the tax cut bill is the
industry's victory: The legislation would phase the deduction back
up to 80 percent, at 5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't see any good reason why the public should
subsidize lavish business meals when there's not even a requirement
that business need to be discussed at these meals,'' said Rep.
Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas. ``So you have tax payers subsidizing _
maybe its not a martini _ it's a $100 bottle of Cabernet and a
thick steak.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant industry insists that the average check for a
business meal is less than $20 and that the three-martini lunch is
as much a thing of the past as, say, the automat or the drive-in
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to compete today you have to stay sharp and
you cannot dull your senses with alcoholic lunch,'' said Jim
Wordsworth, owner of J.R.'s Stockyards Inn in Tyson's Corner, Va.,
and a board member of the association. ``So that is a myth and a
carry-over of the life style of the '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told Congress recently that many of those who use his
restaurant for business meals are consultants or small business
owners or salespeople. ``Each one of them considers my restaurant
his or her conference room,'' he said. ``And for many of these
small-business people this is the best and sometimes the only way
for them to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   But the effect on the federal treasury is not so small. Over a
decade the provision is expected to cost the government $8.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate takes up its own $792 billion tax bill next week,
which is substantially different and filled with its own
special-interest provisions. Clinton has vowed to veto any tax
measure of such size, saying he does not want to jeopardize the
nation's economic well-being.

CLINTONS TO SPLIT VACATION BETWEEN HAMPTONS AND MARTHA'S VINEYARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton are
planning an August vacation partly on Martha's Vineyard and partly
in New York state, including a weekend of fund-raising in the
Hamptons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons had been considering spending their entire vacation
in New York, where Mrs. Clinton is expected to run for the Senate.
But a White House official said they became concerned that suddenly
deciding to spend two weeks there, after four summers on Martha's
Vineyard, would look too transparent and open her to further
ridicule as a carpetbagger with no natural roots in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The question of transparency seemed an unusual concern, however,
since she has all but declared her Senate candidacy and has already
made moves that have been criticized as overtly political, such as
putting on a Yankees cap and claiming lifelong Yankee adoration,
even though she grew up in Chicago as a Cubs fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, she's damned if she does and damned if she
doesn't,'' one official said. The concern now, this official said,
was for Mrs. Clinton to get away on vacation, ``to avoid burnout 15
months out'' from next year's election. ``Despite her incredible
stamina, this is a marathon and not a sprint, and a vacation will
serve her well, wherever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was known to be resisting the Vineyard this year
because of the difficult circumstances of their vacation there last
year, which began with Clinton's admission that he had had an
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clintons like the Vineyard, and that's where their
friends congregate. Officials said they had made the decision to go
before the news a week ago that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane had
crashed off the Vineyard coast. Sailing with the Kennedys has been
one of their favorite Vineyard activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons then plan to spend a week or so in upstate New York
before a fund-raising weekend in East Hampton with the Democratic
National Committee. But officials cautioned that deciding where to
go is always a complex matter for the Clintons, who have no family
summer gathering spot, and that their plans could change.

KENNEDY COVERAGE: COMMUNAL MIND CONTROL AND ILLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KENNEDY-RDP) 
(lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   That sickening thud in the stomach so many people felt on
hearing that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was missing had nothing to
do with a family curse or his role in history. Hearing this news
was more like learning that Princess Diana had died or that a brick
had fallen off a building and killed a passerby. Here was someone
who, in a flash, had literally vanished from the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   And though Kennedy's death offered one more reminder that no
amount of money or fame can protect you, paradoxically the stunned
response was intensified by our attachment to celebrity. Kennedy
was part of a constellation of the famous whom the media have made
familiar; when one of those stars falls out of place, something
seems off kilter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It took television no time at all to ignore such human responses
and substitute bogus ones. During a week of relentless coverage,
which seemed all the more inescapable because it dominated the
networks as well as the 24-hour news channels, television became
increasingly detached from reality. Attempting to find significance
in a life that was still being formed, television commentators
imposed a historical shape on it. With this death, television has
not served the useful function of communal mourning so much as it
has provided communal mind control and illusion.
</P>
<P>
   What began last Saturday with wall-to-wall network coverage of
the search for the missing plane (non-news labeled ``breaking
news'' for days) reached almost absurd depths Friday with live
coverage of an event that could not be covered. Dan Rather, Tom
Brokaw and Peter Jennings were all on the air for the memorial Mass
from which cameras and microphones were banned. The anchors did the
equivalent of the red-carpet arrivals, identifying the guests.
</P>
<P>
   The commentators continued a process that had begun with word of
the missing plane: Kennedy (and by extension his dutifully
mentioned wife and sister-in-law) were canvases on which reporters,
historians and long-lost college classmates imposed what they
wanted to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The most incessantly asked question about Kennedy was also the
most irrelevant and unanswerable: Would he have gone into politics
had he lived? An astonishing number of people convinced themselves,
on evidence usually no better than wishful thinking, that he would
have.
</P>
<P>
   And every channel instantly trotted out childhood pictures,
dominated by the image of Kennedy as a 3-year-old saluting his
father's coffin. It is an undeniably heart-wrenching image, but at
times was put to tacky use. During MSNBC's coverage of Friday's
memorial, it accompanied the logo ``A Final Salute.''
</P>
<P>
   The image soon became a generational litmus test. Those who
remembered having seen that salute 35 years ago histrionically
viewed Kennedy as the heir to Camelot. More realistically, those of
Kennedy's own generation saw him as a decent man who died
frighteningly young. But because commentators who remembered the
image far outnumbered those who did not (youth may dominate
television entertainment, but not news) the image became a pat
explanation for the outpouring of grief, the we-remember-John-John
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   This coverage was about celebrity, not politics or history. And
though fame has its social meaning (Kennedy's celebrity-political
magazine, George, is prime evidence), that is not the issue
television explored. Instead, reporters became defensive and
disingenuous about their voyeuristic roles. On CNN, Larry King
prodded Gary Tuchman, the reporter staking out the home of
Kennedy's sister, Caroline, to say he was waiting just in case she
wanted to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   None of this denies the tragedy of these three deaths or the
genuine emotional tug that accompanies them. It does suggest a
media that generates significance rather than discerns it. There
were a few hints that some people realized that. Peter Jennings was
at times a voice of sanity Friday. During ABC's coverage of the
memorial, he referred to the weight of meaning the media had been
attaching to Kennedy all week and asked the most realistic but
least heeded question of all: ``I wonder if we're not imposing a
burden on him in death that he would not have appreciated in
life.''

<P>
   For most of this year, the chat on the Internet had it that
Sunrise Technologies International Inc., a small California medical
device company, was a stock sure to deliver a bountiful return.
</P>
<P>
   So far though, it has served up only heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   A government advisory panel voted unanimously Thursday to advise
the Food and Drug Administration to reject Sunrise Technologies'
new laser to treat farsightedness. The decision shocked a devoted
coterie of investors who were convinced the remedy was a sure
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Investors could not bail out fast enough. The company's shares
plunged 75.2 percent, or $11.28125, Friday, to $3.71875. More than
27 million shares changed hands Friday, making the stock the
second-most actively traded for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was their day, and they failed miserably,'' said Evan
Sturza, president of Sturza's Medical Research in New York.
``Sunrise Technologies has one product, one trick pony. And it just
broke its ankle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though investors rushed in to buy shares during the last
six months, analysts insist that most of them should have known
what was coming. As is the case with many stocks that are touted on
the Internet, investors tend to rely too much on cyberspace
information instead of doing proper research.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Sunrise Technologies made several recent
disclosures in its Securities and Exchange Commission filings
warning of financial woes at the company. In a document filed with
the SEC June 18, Sunrise Technologies stated that the company's
``working capital had been seriously depleted.'' The company went
on to say that FDA approval for its laser device could be delayed
substantially, causing an ``adverse effect'' on its business.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Friday that the Internet jabber told a different
story. Internet investors had long speculated that Sunrise
Technologies' laser treatment would not only be approved but
eventually snatch a large share of the $11 billion spent each year
in the United States on eyeglasses and contact lenses. Believing
that, investors rushed to buy shares in Sunrise Technologies,
eventually pushing the stock up 205 percent during the last six
months. The stock hit its 52-week high of $19.50 July 13.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet chat was encouraging to some investors,
analysts said that the stock was also being pushed by doctors and
sales people for prescription drugs and medical devices. Sunrise
Technologies acknowledged in a recent SEC document that some of the
11 doctors who conducted clinical trials on its laser held shares
of the company's stock. Analysts have questioned whether those
positions might have biased the clinical trial results.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Sunrise Technologies Friday was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors and other investors who were behind this stock
thought the laser treatment was a lay up,'' said Sturza, who told
investors last week that Sunrise Technologies' laser had little
chance of commercial success. ``Investors made the laser treatment
into a trendy procedure. But it was actually very low-tech.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden plunge of Sunrise Technologies stock appears to have
hurt more than investors. One broker complained Friday that many
investors had bought the stock on margin and he now feared that
they might not be able to pay off their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were doubtful that Sunrise Technologies would survive
unless it gets its laser treatment approved by the FDA. The company
said in a statement Thursday that it would continue to seek
government approval for its laser system.
</P>
<P>
   And not all investors are crying over Sunrise Technologies'
setback. Analysts said that one of Sunrise Technologies' top
competitors, Visx Inc., in Santa Clara, Calif., should pick up
hundreds of new laser patients. The company's stock rose 5.4
percent, or $5.25, Friday to close at $101.34. The stock has
returned 365 percent so far this year.

   Women as Chief Executives: OK, Who Could Be Next? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Carleton S. Fiorina, chosen last week to lead
Hewlett-Packard, becoming only the third female chief executive of
a Fortune 500 company, it's not too soon to ask who might be No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Lois D. Juliber, who runs Colgate-Palmolive's operations in
developed markets, is often mentioned by executive recruiters as
likely to succeed Reuben Mark, Colgate's chief.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Jung, president of Avon Products and a board member, is a
potential chief executive at her company or elsewhere. Last year,
she joined the General Electric board.
</P>
<P>
   At Hewlett-Packard, Ann M. Livermore, who heads enterprise
computing, was the leading insider for the top job. Now she is on
every headhunter's list of top candidates to lead other technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Two other technology executives to watch, recruiters say, are
Linda Sanford, the general manager of the global industries
division at IBM, and Patricia F. Russo, an executive vice president
at Lucent Technologies, Ms. Fiorina's former employer.
</P>
<P>
   Other women considered upwardly mobile are Karen L. Katen,
president of United States pharmaceuticals for Pfizer, and Ellen R.
Marram, the former chief executive of Tropicana Beverage Group.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect these women to be juggling work and children. Women
may be shattering the glass ceiling, but most of those next in line
are doing it without young children in tow. &QL;

   The Man Who Named Hoover Inc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behind Hoover's Inc., a business information company that went
public last week, there really is a Hoover. But Gary E. Hoover has
shown himself better at creating successful businesses than making
a killing as they matured. Hoover parted with most of his stake in
Hoover's years ago, donating some to charity and using another
piece for his next venture, Travelfest, a travel superstore.
</P>
<P>
   Though Travelfest failed _ hurt by airlines' cuts in
travel-agent commissions _ Hoover's record remains impressive. He
arrived in Austin in 1982 with $350,000 from investors to found
Bookstop, one of the earliest book superstores. Barnes &AMP; Noble
bought it seven years later for $41.5 million, though Hoover got
just a little more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Hoover's in 1990. Within a few years he turned over
the reins to an old college buddy after it became clear that the
future was not in familiar print products like Hoover's Handbook
but in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a CEO three times, so I know what it's like to have
people hanging over your shoulder when they don't know what they're
talking about, and I refused to be one of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now sitting on $1.5 million in Hoover's shares, he plans to
write a book on traits of successful entrepreneurs. ``Starting
companies is a young person's game,'' Hoover, 48, said. &QL;

   That UPS Mystique &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those virile UPS delivery men will now have another source of
appeal: money. Plans by United Parcel Service of America Inc. for
an initial public offering, announced last week, are likely to
place a high value on employees' holdings.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the delivery men report more interest from male
stock-market fanatics and drivers for competitors like Federal
Express than from female romantics. ``It's been mostly men in
elevators,'' said Mike McMahon, a driver based in midtown
Manhattan. ``They say they heard the news about UPS going public
and wish you luck. The attitude seems to be, `How can the public
get on the bandwagon?'''

</P>
<P>
   A Year 2000 Peace Corps &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Howard A. Rubin knew that developing countries were lagging in
Year 2000 computer preparations well before the United Nations
convened the first international gathering on the challenge last
December. But Rubin, chairman of the Department of Computer Science
at Hunter College in New York, was surprised to learn that many
nations had done virtually nothing. Rubin also has a Pound Ridge,
N.Y., consulting firm that bears his name and has clients including
IBM and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   As Rubin, 50, fretted with others at the meeting, the idea of a
Internet-based volunteer network for such nations was formed. That
network became a reality this spring as the ``Yes Corps,'' with
Rubin as chairman. Today, he said, the roster of experts offering
free advice over the Web _ a virtual Peace Corps _ has climbed to
100, and 36 nations have asked for help.

AT LAST, THE EURO LOOKS READY TO CLIMB

<TEXT>
<P>
   The euro, Europe's single currency, has made a rebound in the
last week and a half that investors should not ignore.
</P>
<P>
   After falling 13 percent since its January debut, to a low of
$1.0136 on July 14, the euro has jumped 3.6 percent, to $1.050.
More important, some currency analysts think that the euro's worst
days are behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very critical juncture,'' said Karen E. Parker, the
currency strategist at Chase Manhattan Bank. The reason, of course,
is that market turns offer investors an inviting opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Americans can buy European stocks or bonds while
they are still relatively cheap in dollar terms. Then, if the euro
strengthens, they can watch it magnify their returns. That would be
the opposite of what happened in the first half of the year, when
the euro's plunge eroded Americans' gains in European stocks _
sometimes turning them into losses.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the year, the consensus, especially among
European strategists, was that the euro would rise. Ms. Parker,
however, predicted a decline, although she did not anticipate how
fast it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Now her outlook is changing. ``We're on the verge of calling a
bottom in the euro,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Any long-term turnaround for the euro requires a shift in the
economic growth trajectories of Europe and the United States:
Europe's growth must accelerate, and America's must slow. If that
happens, investing in Europe will become more attractive and the
money that flows in will help lift the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports last week indicated that the shift might be
starting. The Ifo economic research institute reported that its
index of business confidence in Germany, Europe's largest economy,
jumped to 92.9 in June, from 90.5 in May. The increase was bigger
than expected and could signal that businesses are ready to
increase investment and hire more workers, all prerequisites for a
good economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the May trade deficit, a record $21.3
billion, indicated that surging imports and slowing exports were
putting a drag on economic growth. In the wake of the report, Chase
reduced its forecast for second-quarter economic growth to an
annual rate of 2.5 percent, from 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The growing trade deficit also has a benefit of its own for the
euro. As the United States imports more goods, foreign businesses
reap more dollars. The exchange of those dollars into local
currencies weakens the dollar and lifts the other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The euro could also be lifted faster and farther if investors
who have been shorting the euro all year are suddenly forced to
switch their positions to avoid big losses. That may already be
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parker warns, however, that this euro rally could fade. A
long-term rally, she said, depends on the enactment of broad
economic reforms in Europe, including corporate tax cuts, changes
in pension and other employee benefits and easing of restrictions
on cross-border mergers. Those changes, she said, would spur
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said that signs of revival in Europe _ combined with
the narrowing gap between higher United States interest rates and
lower European ones _ mean that the euro might bottom at $1.03 in
the next two months and could climb as high as $1.08 in the year
ahead. That would leave it 8 percent below its debut level.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
and a self-proclaimed euro-skeptic, has taken his own conversion a
little further. He thinks the euro could jump quickly to $1.10.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of a turn in markets is among the most
difficult tasks for investors. And the bounce of the euro in the
last week and a half is just one example of how fast the outlook
for a currency can change. That is why some money managers ride out
market declines rather than betting that they can get out and then
get back in at just the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the euro opportunity is attractive. If this is not
the bottom, it probably isn't far away. And if you believe that
Euroland is turning around, getting in today will not seem so late
a year from now.
</P>

FEAR OF CRIME DRIVES UP ARMORED CAR BUSINESS IN BRAZIL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ One morning in March, two men shot at
point-blank range at the driver of a sedan carrying the three
school-age children of Jorge Paulo Lemann, one of Brazil's
wealthiest men. The car's glass did not shatter.
</P>
<P>
   The car was armored, so just one of the 20 bullets fired in the
kidnapping attempt punctured the driver's window, grazing his right
arm. He sped to safety, weaving through the quiet, tree-lined
streets of the exclusive Jardim Europa neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Lemann, a former banker who is now an investor in Latin
America's largest brewery, declined to comment on the incident.
Like many other wealthy individuals in Brazil, where publicity is
linked to the fear of kidnapping, he shuns the media.
</P>
<P>
   But the company that armored his car, the O'Gara-Hess &AMP;
Eisenhardt Armoring Co., which is based in Fairfield, Ohio, and has
various operations around the world, is basking in the media
coverage. O'Gara's sales of armoring for cars at its Sao Paulo
office tripled after the incident, to 90 vehicles a month from 30.
And business is also booming at the 20 or so other car-armoring
companies here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prosper when times are bad,'' said Adilson Parrella,
president of O'Gara's Brazilian subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   While Brazil's elite remain relatively well off in a stagnant
economy, large swaths of society are struggling. And perhaps no
trend better illustrates the strain placed on Brazilian society by
a skewed income gap than the recent surge in car armoring. This is
especially true in urban centers like Sao Paulo, where unemployment
is at a record high.
</P>
<P>
   With the gross domestic product expected to fall by 1 percent
this year, car sales as a whole are declining. According to the
National Association of Car Manufacturers, sales fell nearly 20
percent in June from June 1998. The main reason for the slump is
the high interest rates the government is using to control
inflation and attract foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   Those same rates, hovering above 20 percent, have helped provide
a shield against the recession for wealthy Brazilians who invest in
the government's high-yielding bonds. Combined with impressive
returns on the Brazilian stock market, most investors here have
done reasonably well since the currency, the real, was devalued in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from car-armoring companies say the market for
such vehicles is expected to rise to $70 million this year, a 60
percent increase from 1998. O'Gara, a unit of Kroll O'Gara
Associates, is the market leader, vying for customers with domestic
competitors like Inbrafiltro Industria e Comercio.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than half the cars parked outside the finest restaurants
of this city are armored,'' said Marcelo Silva, the sales manager
at Inbrafiltro's armoring division.
</P>
<P>
   Inbrafiltro, which uses Brazilian-made bullet-resistant glass,
charges about 40,000 reais, or $22,200, to armor automobiles, while
O'Gara, which uses mainly imported material, charges $35,000 for an
average job. All this is on top of the normal price of the car,
which tend to run high in Brazil because of tariffs on imported
autos.
</P>
<P>
   Additional items like anti-explosive gas tanks, non-puncturing
car batteries, sirens, walkie-talkie systems and armoring resistant
to gunfire from automatic weapons like AK-47s can more than double
the price.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the cars favored by prosperous Paulistanos,
as this city's residents are called, BMWs, Mercedes and Jeep
Cherokees top the list of the most sought-after models for
armoring. The Volvo Car Corp., of Sweden, a unit of the Ford Motor
Co., is looking to join this group through an agreement formed this
month with O'Gara.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, Volvo's Brazilian subsidiary agreed to work
exclusively with O'Gara to armor cars at an average cost of
$38,000. The advantage of the deal for the consumer in search of an
armoring job will be a brand new Volvo with O'Gara armoring sold
with a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're providing added value to the existing image of Volvo as
a very safe automobile,'' said Luis Carlos Name Pimenta, head of
Volvo's operations for Mercosur, the South American trade bloc
consisting of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies said they expect sales of $400,000 a month
from the agreement, which will armor Volvos on their arrival in
Brazil from factories in Sweden, Belgium and Holland.
</P>
<P>
   While some Brazilians are rushing to purchase such vehicles,
others are trying to decipher their allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is emblematic of the end of a society,'' said Ignacio de
Loyola Brandao, a writer whose 1982 novel, ``And Still the Earth,''
is a science fiction account of Sao Paulo gone awry in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon the haves will circulate throughout the city in personal
tanks,'' Brandao said in an interview. ``And the misery, the
banditry, the conditions that make this possible, will coexist with
this perversity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Sao Paulo wasn't always a city of such extremes. In 1960, before
about 46 million Brazilians left rural areas for cities over the
next three decades in one of the largest migrations of the 20th
century, Sao Paulo was a relatively calm city of 3.7 million. And
income disparities across Brazilian society were not as sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Then, commuters were served by an extensive network of trolley
cars and buses and a fleet of 164,000 automobiles, according to the
Fernand Braudel Institute of World Economics, a think tank here.
Today, there are roughly 17 million people in Sao Paulo and 5.1
million cars.
</P>
<P>
   The city underwent a metamorphosis to make way for all of the
cars. The trolleys were discarded, cobblestone streets were widened
into vast thoroughfares and tunnels were built under the city
center. Even more than in most cities, pedestrians were relegated
to second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   With a new, car-dominated Sao Paulo chiseled out of the old,
another important trend was changing urban life: crime. Afraid of
muggings and other street crime, many well-off Paulistanos have
retreated in the last 20 years into gated communities with names
like Alphaville or Mountain Village.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tulio Kahn, a U.N. researcher here who has studied
the rise of urban violence, the same fear that is fueling the
increase in armored-car sales and the cordoning off of residential
areas has also contributed to the rapid growth of private security
services.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Sao Paulo, which includes the city proper and
other regions with a combined population of 35 million, there are
about 400,000 private security guards, compared with 120,000 police
officers. A third of the citizens of Sao Paulo pay security guards
to watch over their homes, according to U.N. figures.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the recent concern over crime has been centered around
the automobile, though. There were 23,562 car robberies in the
first quarter of 1999, a 54 percent increase from the period a year
earlier. ``Car theft has grown more than any other type of crime,''
Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   But does the threat of having your car stolen justify the
expense of having it armored? The answer may have more to do with
the perception of fear and with the disposable income of Brazil's
wealthy than with the probability of life-threatening crime while
one is driving.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers for years have been vulnerable to muggings at
intersections and have even developed the habit of speeding through
red lights at night or when streets are empty of traffic. In Rio de
Janeiro, in fact, officials recently told drivers they would not be
fined for running red lights at night. But carjackings or the type
of hold-ups involving automobiles that end in gunfire are far less
common than car thefts, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rush for armored cars is more about displaying status than
protecting oneself,'' said Jose Vicente da Silva Filho, a former
colonel in the military police who is now a researcher at the
Fernand Braudel Institute.
</P>
<P>
   According to Da Silva, Sao Paulo had 5,157 homicides last year.
Yet only about 200 of those murders were related to robberies.
</P>
<P>
   And in a display of how violence plagues poor neighborhoods much
more than rich ones, the more prosperous districts were relatively
free of murders.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the police district encompassing Jardins, a
group of Sao Paulo's most prosperous neighborhoods, there were no
homicides in 1998. In nearby Jardim Angela, police registered 195
murders last year, or an average of 16.3 a month. Yet few
armored-car owners from Jardins have ever ventured close to Jardim
Angela.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone insists on driving a BMW around Sao Paulo, I'd
advise them to put 1,000 reais ($555) in their glove compartment
instead of spending 40,000 to armor their car,'' Da Silva said.
``Give the 1,000 reais to the bandit. It's cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   For most people here, like Ana Carolina Bueno Abe, a 24-year-old
saleswoman for a pharmaceuticals company, less might do.
</P>
<P>
   Early one morning in April, shortly after stories appeared on
the Lemann kidnapping attempt, two adolescent girls approached Ms.
Abe's car as she waited at a red light. One girl stretched her arm
through the window and held a piece of broken glass to her throat,
demanding the money from her purse. ``I only had 2 reais in cash,''
_ about $1.10 _ Ms. Abe said. ``I gave it to her and she walked
away.''

U.S. RESUMING AID FOR ANTI-MILOSEVIC GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a month of demonstrations throughout Serbia
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, the Clinton
administration quietly decided this week to lift restrictions on
support for Serbian opposition groups and free aid for opposition
political parties, the independent media, lawyers and other groups
promoting democracy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials have been debating how to renew
and increase support for these groups without violating the
sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia that forbade any support other
than emergency aid as long as Milosevic remained president,
according to an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   The legal counsel at the State Department determined that it had
the authority to grant waivers case by case for projects supporting
opposition groups within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lawyers and State Department lawyers agreed last week that
we could provide assistance and go forward with the programs for
independent media, opposition parties and trade unions,'' said John
Tennant, deputy assistant administrator at the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the State Department began notifying aid groups that
their government financing was no longer blocked and advising them
to revive their programs. Department officials said the programs
would receive about $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been far more helpful if the administration had
addressed this early on when the opposition to Milosevic was
developing,'' said Morton Abramowitz, a retired ambassador and a
board member of the National Endowment for Democracy, one of the
organizations whose funds had been blocked. ``But obviously I'm
glad the freeze is over because the opposition is in dire need of
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the administration and Congress intend to present proposals
next week to help the Serbian opposition. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, plans to
introduce legislation that would provide $100 million over the next
two years ``to promote democracy and civil society in Yugoslavia,''
as well as to increase the number of radio broadcasts by Voice of
America and Radio Free Europe into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Next week President Clinton will make his own proposals at a
gathering of world leaders in Sarajevo to discuss the
reconstruction of the Balkans, according to an administration
official who said the president's proposals will include new
financing for the Serbian opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see Milosevic gone, we want to see new leadership
in Serbia, we want to help the opposition to that end,'' said the
official.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was consulted before the administration freed the funds
this week, according to Tennant, to insure that there would be no
objections to waiving the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The consultations over the legal and political reverberations of
support for the Serbian opposition became entangled in the larger
policy debate of how to reconstruct the Balkans and delayed the
final decision until this week, according to Paul McCarthy, who
received a letter from the State Department on Tuesday authorizing
him to begin reviving his Balkan programs at the National Endowment
for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they were interested in seeing us move ahead but it
became part of their whole debate about the Balkans and how to
coordinate our policies with our allies,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other aid officials, McCarthy refused to name the Serbian
groups that would receive assistance through his group's programs,
in order to protect them from possible reprisals by the government
of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The administration financing will also go to Serbian groups
supported by the National Democratic Institute and the
International Republican Institute.

   Fewer Lawsuits? In This Country? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Are American investors shedding their litigious habits?
Securities lawyers need not ponder second careers just yet, but a
recent study says the filing rate for securities lawsuits has
plummeted since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year Congress passed the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act, which effectively raised the threshold for
proof when investors make accusations of fraud against
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The study, in the June issue of Securities Class Action Alert, a
newsletter, focused on the average litigation rate: the number of
securities class-action suits filed in a given year divided by the
total number of companies whose stocks traded. It found that the
rate fell from 2.01 percent in the three years from 1993 to 1995 to
just 1.60 percent from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But don't jump to the conclusion that the decline is because of
the effectiveness of the 1995 legislation, said James M. Newman,
editor of the newsletter, which is based in Upper Saddle River,
N.J. Instead, he credited the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up in stocks, he said, had a two-pronged effect.
``Investors tend to ignore bad news in a bull market,'' Newman
said, referring to any questions of financial impropriety that may
arise when a stock is climbing. And, he said, company executives
are more likely to behave themselves: ``The corporate officers
don't have as much need to hide bad news _ they don't have to
manipulate their numbers.''

   Pay Gaps in Money Management &QL;

   If you want to manage assets for a living and make the most
money doing it, you should work for a mutual fund company in New
York or Boston, concentrate on global investing _ and be male.
</P>
<P>
   Investment professionals, including stock and bond managers,
analysts, marketers and top executives, will earn a median salary,
bonus and other compensation of $150,000 this year, according to a
survey of 8,600 money management employees conducted by Russell
Reynolds Associates, an executive search firm, and the Association
of Investment Management and Research, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways, it seems, for money managers to improve
their compensation. If they invest in global stocks, their median
annual pay rises by $60,000. Working in the Northeast increases
paychecks by $33,000. And managing mutual funds, rather than
pension funds or insurance assets, makes compensation jump $47,000.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of a Y chromosome brings the median salary to
$155,000, about 21 percent, or $26,750, above a woman's.
</P>
<P>
   ``A greater proportion of men are chief executives or chief
investment officers, and a higher proportion of men are employed by
securities firms, which tend to pay more,'' said Richard S.
Lannamann, a managing director and co-leader of the financial
services practice at Russell Reynolds. More women, he said, manage
bonds or work at pension fund managers _ two categories with
lower-than-average paychecks.

   Requiem for an Ex-Heavyweight? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The end appears near for what was once one of the fund
industry's hottest offerings. The trustees of the $708 million John
Hancock Special Equities fund, which has badly lagged behind its
peers in recent years, have proposed merging it with the John
Hancock Small Cap Growth fund, which has $722 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to merge the fund out of existence comes just over
a year after Michael P. DiCarlo surrendered the managerial reins.
From 1991, when the fund returned a stunning 84.5 percent, through
1995, DiCarlo turned in a sizzling performance, easily beating the
fund's peers and benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   After 1995, however, the fund trailed badly, and last July
DiCarlo gave up his position to concentrate on the hedge fund
management company he runs, DFS Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by the same team _ Laura Allen, Bernice S. Behar
and Anurag Pandit _ that manages Small Cap Growth, which is far
more broadly diversified than Special Equities.
</P>
<P>
   Though nearly all the 80 or so stocks held by Special Equities
are also in the Small Cap Growth portfolio of more than 180 stocks,
the two funds posted wildly different results. Over the 12 months
through June, Special Equities lost 8.7 percent, while its sibling
returned a sizzling 17.8 percent, far more than its peers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that difference in 12-month returns was a result of
portfolio turnover when Special Equities' management changed. But
David L. Eisenberg, John Hancock's chief equity strategist, also
said that despite overlapping stocks, the funds had different
sector emphases this year.
</P>
<P>
   Small Cap Growth overweighted technology and underweighted
health care, while its sibling did the opposite. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when a second career seems a radical departure, it may not
be that big a jolt. Consider the case of Paul C. Rissman, who once
was an archeologist specializing in the early civilizations of
India. Today Rissman, manager of the $3.21 billion Alliance Growth
and Income fund, says archeology has helped his stock-picking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a long time learning how to do research, and once you
know,'' he said, ``you can do research on just about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A stretch? Perhaps. But Rissman, 42, has managed an impressive
performance at the fund. It has returned 30.7 percent annually, on
average, for the three years ended July 16, compared with 23.6
percent for the average large-capitalization value fund, according
to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, and 33.4
percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in
1985, Rissman divided his time between research in India and
part-time teaching positions at Columbia University and at Drew
University in Madison, N.J. He was looking for a tenure-track
position but gave up after three years, he said, because ``there
were no jobs for people who specialized in South Asian
archaeology.''
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to study for a master's degree in business
administration at Columbia, specializing in investment finance.
</P>
<P>
   He was an intern at Alliance Capital Management in New York
during the summer of 1989, went to work there full-time soon
afterward and received his MBA in 1991. In November 1994, he took
charge of the Growth and Income fund with a mandate to make it more
value-oriented, adding diversity to Alliance's funds, which were
mostly devoted to growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Rissman uses computer models to screen about 500 stocks _ most
with large capitalizations _ that are followed by Alliance
analysts. His goal is to find stocks that can beat Wall Street's
earnings growth estimates but are still relatively cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the models calculate price-to-earnings
ratios using so-called normalized earnings _ earnings that are
adjusted to ignore cyclical distortions, producing what Rissman
described as a ``true picture'' of companies' earning power.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of analysts, who set price targets on the stocks,
Rissman uses the normalized P/E ratios and other data to decide
which stocks deserve fundamental research. He looks for good and
improving returns on capital, solid market positions and
``managements that aren't incompetent or crooked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He likes dividends, but doesn't make them a prerequisite for
companies in the fund, which usually holds 80 to 90 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And Rissman pays particular attention to stocks that trade at
low multiples to free cash flow, a number he says he calculates by
subtracting financial obligations and capital spending from
operating income. A low multiple gives a company an opportunity to
buy back its shares every so often _ in what he calls a ``slow
L.B.0.,'' or leveraged buyout.
</P>
<P>
   The fund lagged behind the S&AMP;P 500 in 1997 and 1998, when growth
stocks were hot. But Rissman credits the acceleration in corporate
earnings growth this year with prompting new interest in value
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at the high price that they paid for growth
previously, and they say, `Well, what am I doing this for? Look at
all these bargains that are around the market,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The top holding in the fund, at about 4.5 percent of assets, is
Bank of America. The fund already owned a small amount of
Nationsbank stock when shares in many banks dipped sharply last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Rissman bought about a million more shares in September _ when
Nationsbank was acquiring BankAmerica and adopting its name _ at
what he considered bargain prices of $50 to $55 a share. In May, he
bought another million shares. The stock closed last week at
$68.625.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the price of the stock should go up faster than the
earnings,'' he said, though he declined to give a price target.
Analysts estimate Bank of America's earnings growth at 16 percent
for 2000; it yields 2.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rissman first bought shares of the First Data Corp., the credit
card processing company, at about $27 in December. The shares had
been beaten down because of flagging earnings growth in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has replaced many of its short-term service
contracts with new ones that have longer terms, he said, letting it
strike better deals with the insurers and publishers who sell their
goods and services through its mailings to credit card customers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the company's earnings will grow about 14
percent a year, on average, for the next three years, and Rissman
said he thinks the stock price will grow even faster. First Data,
which yields a slim 0.16 percent, closed on Friday at $48.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Rissman held what he called ``an insignificant position'' in
Noble Drilling, a Houston company specializing in offshore oil
drilling, in late 1997. But between August 1998 and March of this
year, he bought three million shares, paying about $11 a share in
August. The stock now trades at $21.8125.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought that oil prices were going to be at $12 a
barrel forever,'' Rissman said. Now that oil costs more _ it was
$20.49 a barrel on Friday _ he expects Noble's earnings to grow
about 50 percent a year over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   He does not expect Noble stock, which has no dividend, to rise
that fast, but ``I wouldn't be surprised if it doubled over the
next four years,'' he said.

WHY CAN'T WINNEBAGO TURN HEADS ON WALL ST.?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a million Americans, summer means hitting the road
in something larger than, say, a Jeep Wrangler. Motor homes, for
years dismissed as lumbering icons of decades past, are fashionable
again.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1.5 million households owned motor homes in 1997, and the
number is expected to grow to 1.6 million in 2000 and 1.7 million
by 2005, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association,
a trade group in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Winnebago Industries, of course, is a name synonymous with motor
homes. So after years of being ignored by many investors, the
company's stock has become an increasingly popular way to bet on
the huge population of aging boomers, many of whom are not that far
from retirement age. (The median age of motor home buyers is 63.)
</P>
<P>
   Winnebago's stock, which has traded below $10 for most of the
decade, has nearly doubled since its 1999 low in March; it closed
on Friday at $25.9375, its high.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its strong brand-recognition, Winnebago, based in
Forest City, Iowa, is also benefiting from the popularity of a new
line of upscale motor homes filled with many of the comforts of a
typical suburban home and with prices to match _ they run as high
as $265,000.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended May 29, Winnebago's net income doubled
from the corresponding period a year earlier, to $14.6 million, or
66 cents a share, on sales of $191.5 million. At the end of the
quarter, it had orders in hand for 2,200 units up 170 percent from
a year earlier _ evidence that Winnebago made the right move in
adding high-end motor homes to its line last year under the
direction of a new chief executive, Bruce D. Hertzke. That helped
widen profit margins to 17 percent, from 14 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wall Street has virtually ignored the company. Few mutual
funds have substantial stakes in it, and only one analyst _ Jeff M.
Graff at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis _ actively follows the
stock, having started coverage in June.
</P>
<P>
   Graff noted that Winnebago and its rivals, which include
Coachmen Industries and Fleetwood Enterprises, tend to trade at 10
to 12 times the current year's earnings per share. He expects
Winnebago to report earnings of $1.89 a share this year, so the
stock is trading at 14 times his estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Olstein, a value investor who runs the Olstein
Financial Alert fund, recently cut his position in Winnebago in
half _ to less than 1 percent of fund assets. But he estimates that
the stock is still trading at a 20 percent discount to its private
market value _ what he thinks it is really worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a good company and I still like it long term. But
I'm always trying to get a bargain,'' said Olstein, who added that
he does not expect to sell the rest of his stake unless the stock
reaches the low $30s.
</P>
<P>
   Others are also betting Winnebago can grow. Art Bonnel, who runs
the $110 million U.S. Global Bonnel Growth fund, has 1.26 percent
of its assets in Winnebago and says he thinks the stock could hit
$40 over the next two to three years. He expects Winnebago to post
profits of $2 a share in the fiscal year ending Aug. 28, double
last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
   Winnebago is flush with cash _ $56.4 million at the end of the
quarter _ and carries no debt, so a company spokeswoman, Sheila
Davis, says it does not really need Wall Street's spotlight in
order to continue its climb. In June, Winnebago's board authorized
the repurchase of up to $15 million in stock _ its third such
announcement in two years. Days later, Winnebago said it planned to
spend $3.6 million to increase production by 1,000 units a year.
</P>
<P>
   The company has no plans to market itself to Wall Street more
aggressively. ``Why fix what isn't broken?'' asked Ed Barker, the
chief financial officer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the fourth floor of Metreon, the Sony Corp.'s
new entertainment and retail complex here, an energetic brigade of
towering, fanged, yellow-eyed monsters brings to life Maurice
Sendak's children's classic, ``Where the Wild Things Are.''
</P>
<P>
   They hang from the ceiling, pop out of the craggy landscape and
howl when their football-field-length territory is invaded.
Children scamper through an array of caves and tunnels, building
towers with faux-stone blocks and yanking on the ropes and levers
that make the monsters jump and twirl.
</P>
<P>
   For adults, however, the effect is not so much amusement-park
rowdiness as spectacle and art. Sendak's muted pastel palette
imbues a vast room that spins to the rhythm of a klezmer violin.
Outside, through windows painted with thick jungle fauna, looms San
Francisco's elegant skyline. This swank, city-wise mini-Disneyland
is designed in large part for people who would not be caught dead
wearing mouse ears in the Magic Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Wild Things Are is but a part of Metreon's
sophisticated allure. There are eight stylish eateries, a multiplex
with a gigantic 3-D Imax theater, several one-of-a-kind stores and
two additional attractions no less ingenious than Sendak's
monsters.
</P>
<P>
   With this combination, Sony, having aimed to show the world how
to market electronics, movies and music, presents a new strategy
for promoting eating, entertainment and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Sony hates, hates, hates to describe its new, $85-million-plus,
350,000 square-foot complex as a mall, with that word's
connotations of passive, cookie-cutter suburbia. The preferred term
is ``urban entertainment destination.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade, retail cognoscenti _ mall developers, theme
park owners and entertainment giants like Disney, Dreamworks, and
Universal _ have been looking for a combination of shopping, games
and food that can be packaged compactly and served up to jaundiced
city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Until now none of the many attempts have quite hit the mark. As
Thom McKay, vice president of RTKL Associates, a Baltimore-based
design firm, put it, ``Urban entertainment centers are the Holy
Grail.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony, a newcomer to the field, has come up with a unique blend.
Metreon, which opened here last month, with Tokyo and Berlin
versions under construction, is winning rave reviews within the
rarefied group of designers who combine retailing and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Sony's done is remarkable,'' said Mike Rubin, president
of MRA International, a retailing and entertainment consulting firm
in Philadelphia. ``They really broke the mold. It is an approach to
retail space that a lot of people will start mimicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the mold has become urgent. Malls have been in decline
since their heyday in the 1970s, with fickle consumers spending
less time, on average, per shopping trip. Developers have long been
searching for ways to bring excitement back to their palaces of
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's effort has its roots in two trends that are increasingly
seen as solutions: emphasizing entertainment and re-creating the
vitality of authentic city streets _ but safely.
</P>
<P>
   So-called festival marketplaces, like Faneuil Hall in Boston,
the renovated Baltimore Inner Harbor and South Street Seaport in
New York, built in rundown but historic neighborhoods, were among
the first experiments. Such developments have fallen out of favor,
mostly because they continue to require heavy government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The next wave of innovative malls, in the early 1990s, relied on
attractions to create novelty. But most just plopped features like
a megaplex theater or a theme restaurant into a standard
amalgamation of stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Mall of America in Minneapolis _ which houses an entire
amusement park but also the usual jumble of chain stores. _ is the
archetype. More harmoniously designed are Universal City Walk in
Los Angeles and Coco Walk in Coconut Grove, Fla., idealized
cityscapes with street performers and boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, major entertainment corporations began making
new bids for the leisure time of the shopping class. Dreamworks
teamed up with Sega, the Japanese video game giant, to seed the
nation with its Gameworks outlets of modern video arcades.
</P>
<P>
   Disney produced Disney Quest, essentially a theme park shrunk to
fit an indoor space the size of a department store, the first of
which opened recently in Chicago. While Gameworks and Disney Quest
are more explicitly focused on entertainment, with shopping
secondary, Sony's Metreon has trying a more delicate balance.
</P>
<P>
   The company's path toward Metreon was hardly obvious. Having
sold its products mostly through retailers, Sony had scant
experience with selling directly to consumers. Many executives were
skeptical about any moves in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   The early feeling was that Sony's entry into the urban
entertainment business should be a mini-theme park, light on the
retailing, like Disney Quest or Gameworks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sony's initial concept was much more Disneyesque than
the final plan. The idea was to mine the Sony music and film
divisions for characters to become the basis for attractions, like
a Luther Vandross After Hours Club and a Cinetopia cafe that would
change its design to suit the newest Sony releases. But Sony's
fiefs were not enthusiastic about sharing control of their stars.
</P>
<P>
   Sony responded by trying to determine what truly united its
disparate realms. Its answer was innovative technology.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge was to translate the abstract concept into stone
and steel. ``The hardest thing from a design standpoint is
deciding, `What does the physical face of Sony look like?'' said
Mike Swinney, president of Sony Development. ``We looked at
ourselves as an urban brand, hip and leading edge. We wanted
Metreon to go into a city and reflect those core principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the idea of making Metreon less of an amusement park and
more a high-tech city square was easier to sell at Sony
headquarters in Japan. (The Metreon name comes from ``metropolis''
and ``-eon'', the Greek suffix for meeting place.)
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Sony executives knew that its movie theaters near
Lincoln Center were among the highest-grossing in the nation, and
that nearby stores and restaurants were prospering. Sony wanted
that shopping and dining revenue for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The outlines of the project were in place before Sony chose its
location. Like a mall, but unlike most amusement parks, Metreon
would not charge general admission. A dozen movie theaters and an
Imax would take the place of the department-store anchors.
</P>
<P>
   Attractions with separate fees would draw extra revenue and
provide a reason for families to spend extra hours there _ raising
the odds that they would buy meals or T-shirts. Sony would also
lease space to independent outlets, like the Discovery Channel
Store.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco added texture. Though it seems the least likely
metropolis to need a corporate-constructed entertainment site, Sony
determined that it had an abundance of two receptive populations:
tourists, and residents who had too few spacious, modern movie
theaters.

   Comments from a voluble community immediately began shaping the
project. In focus groups, San Franciscans said they deplored
``kitsch'' and demanded ``authenticity.'' MacLeod said this
response helped Sony reach a conclusion: that amusements based on
critically acclaimed literature had integrity and timelessness that
celebrity culture could not match.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Sendak, Sony turned to David Macaulay, author of ``The
Way Things Work,'' a cleverly illustrated series on the mechanics
of everything from locks to transmissions, and the French graphic
artist Jean Giraud, known as Moebius, to shape attractions. (The
Way Things Work and Where the Wild Things Are cost $7 each. A $17
ticket includes both, and points to play games at the Airtight
Garage, the video arcade based on Moebius' drawings.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with their traditions, San Franciscans also demanded
great food. Residents declared themselves aghast at the usual fare
of mall food courts and decried glitzy restaurants that put quality
second. Metreon offers mini-versions of some of the city's most
popular restaurants, like the Firewood brick-oven pizza parlor, the
Longlife Noodle Co. and Jook Joint, which serves Asian health food.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Development executives like to boast that their technology
is a subtle motif throughout the mall. From the outside, the
Metreon building is done in Sony stereo modern, a sleek but
unremarkable box for the goodies inside. The main entry hall, which
Sony calls Gateway, picks up the technology motif more
aggressively, with giant video panels hanging from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The company's wizardry is put to best use in the Airtight
Garage, Sony's answer to Gameworks. The dark decor evokes a
space-age Art Deco. The games, designed by Sony for Metreon, use
Moebius' comic-book space scenes. They are interactive, with
players challenging users at other stations.
</P>
<P>
   For those without the joystick dexterity of an adolescent, there
is video bowling. Participants move a stationary ball to maneuver a
bowling ball on a larger-than-life video screen. The choice of
lanes includes a San Francisco street (watch out for trolleys) and
the deck of a wave-tossed ship.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's high-tech approach is not as deft when applied to content
that is not inherently amusing. David Macaulay's books provide
witty, illustrated explanations of mechanisms like locks and gears.
But the 3-D film at the center of ``The Way Things Work'' is more a
fourth-grade science teacher's _ and less a fourth grader's _ idea
of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The company has more effectively captured that age cohort at
Sony Playstation, one of the stores designed just for Metreon. The
``computer bar,'' where visitors can sample video games, is,
predictably, a hit. So is the mini movie theater now displaying the
awesomely detailed images to be featured on the Playstation II,
Sony's next game machine.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, Metreon's nine stores are elegant, not
ground-breakingly different; four of them feature Sony products or
designs. One of the others, MicrosoftSF, the software giant's first
store, includes a full display of its software and doodads like
Microsoft coffee mugs ($16) and colored paper clips ($5).
</P>
<P>
   Sony Style showcases the brand's full line of electronics.
Browsers find row after row of Walkmans, each displayed on a tray
with a note card describing its attributes, as if it were a fine
piece of jewelry. White orchids sit serenely on the nearby
counters.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Metreon retail space a step toward the future is
configuration. Like a department store, Metreon has no doors or
partitions between boutiques. Customers can wander from one to
another without entering a central mall corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Atmospherics delineate the boundaries _ Sony Style is all light
wood, for example, while Playstation has metallic countertops and a
raised glass tile floor.
</P>
<P>
   This flowing quality, said Rubin of the MRA consulting firm, is
most likely to be imitated in future malls. John MacLeod, Sony's
vice president of development, said several developers, looking to
collaborate with Sony, have already sent his team architectural
plans for new malls traced ``space for space'' on the Metreon
design. ``It will be copied,'' he said. ``The question is whether
it will be with or without us.''
</P>
<P>
   Full duplication would be expensive. Sony puts its tab for
Metreon at $85 million, but that hardly covers all costs. Sony's
real estate developer, Millennium Partners, picked up the cost of
the building but receives rent from Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Industry consultants say that Sony budgeted close to $160
million and that total costs, spread among Sony and its partners,
might be higher. ``My guess is it cost not a nickel less than $225
million,'' said Harrison Price, president of a Los Angeles
consulting firm bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sony is evaluating whether that hefty cost makes sense.
Before the mall opened, Sony predicted five million to seven
million visitors a year. Based on early traffic, it now says there
will be 12 million this year (about 1.5 million fewer than visited
Disneyland near Los Angeles last year).
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those who go to Disneyland, not all of Metreon's
visitors will spend money. Sony, which is still learning how many
attractions each person visits and how much he spends, wants $100
million in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The full-sized Metreon copies in Tokyo and Berlin will open
within 12 months. As for more of the projects in America, it all
depends. The company could spread the most popular attractions and
restaurants to other malls, either individually or as a package the
size of a department store, to serve as an anchor tenant.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, though, Sony executives want to build up to eight more
Metreon versions in different American cities, still to be chosen,
over the next few years. ``We think we have got something unique,''
MacLeod said. ``It is a two-step leap beyond everyone else.'' But
it will not stay that way for long.

CAN PROFITS KEEP SURGING ALL YEAR? A `YES' VOTE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate America is rolling in dough. So too, it must be added,
are those who have bought and held shares during the last few
years. This is not an incidental relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting season for second-quarter profits is about half
over, and the results are much better than most had reason to
expect even six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of last week, better than half of the companies
that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index have reported an
average profit gain of more than 15 percent from the same period in
1998, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a good chance that profits will rise at a
double-digit rate for all of this year, compared with a 4 percent
increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, many people worry that the game will soon be up.
They think the market, which has been struggling with stratospheric
price-to-earnings ratios, may fall sharply when S&AMP;P 500 earnings
gains revert to historical norms, around 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas M. McManus, equity portfolio strategist at Banc of
America Securities, thinks this earnings run could last a long,
long time, and he took some time last week to explain why. Here are
some excerpts: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You are of the view that this period of strong earnings
growth can continue for the indefinite future. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I sense a significant underlying shift in the ability of
American companies to grow earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the roots are in consolidation, which has been
important in terms of combining two attractive businesses,
maintaining the same amount of revenues but with a much smaller
cost base. That doesn't happen instantly, but over a couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even without consolidation, companies have continued to
restructure, coming up with a different mix of businesses that are
growing faster, are less cyclical and in areas that are
attractively positioned. The best example here is General Electric,
which has been restructuring its businesses for 20 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what does this lead you to conclude? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That there is a higher secular growth rate for S&AMP;P earnings
than most are willing to concede. And the cyclical rebound off of
the decline in earnings last year has occurred sooner and been more
robust than anyone had forecast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your current earnings forecast? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. At the start of 1999 we were more optimistic than most, and
thought S&AMP;P profits would rise by about 10 percent from 1998 levels
and a further 14 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of May, I revised those numbers up, to a gain
of 12 percent this year and 16 percent in 2000. And I think we are
going to raise estimates for this year and 2000 again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you say to those who say the S&AMP;P is overvalued at
these levels? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think anyone who is saying the market is overvalued this
year, be it the Fed or stock market strategists, is not taking into
account that the underlying business mix has improved at least as
much as GE has improved because of a very rapid turnover of
components in the index. It now has less cyclicality and greater
sustainability than it did in the past and deserves to trade at a
higher P/E multiple relative to any interest rate you might choose
or any competing market benchmark around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Also, people should be focusing on free cash flows, not
earnings. Net income is only the first approximation of
profitability. The real value to investors is the amount of cash a
company can take out and still be left with a business that is just
as good as it was before. Companies like Microsoft and Intel are
like that, and that is one reason they trade at such high multiples
to net income. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There are plenty of folks who are worried about the effect
that Year 2000 computer problems will have on the economy and
earnings. Do you share those concerns? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is my view that profits are actually being negatively
impacted right now.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, W.W. Granger admitted their costs went
up by $7 million and their revenues were cut by $10 million in the
last 10 days of June because they adopted a new computer system. It
is my hunch that is their Y2K compliance system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which companies or groups of companies are likely to enjoy
the most rapid earnings growth over the next year or so? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We could see continued improvement in a whole host of
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the market is looking for trends of earnings repair,
or a bounce off the dip we saw last year.
</P>
<P>
   Individual companies we like include Ethan Allen, the furniture
manufacturer and retailer, which experienced a significant hit last
year. We also like W.W. Granger, which is investing heavily in its
Internet presence. We are also very attracted to the semiconductor
capital equipment sector, and really like Novellus in that area.
And we like technology generally.

NOT YOUR FATHER'S FESTIVAL: HIP-HOP AND HIGH-TECH
</HEADLINE>
   (With WOODSTOCK-NYT) 
(rk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ How many of you don't care? hardcore rapper DMX,
using less genteel language, asked the crowd as the sun dropped in
the sky on the first day of Woodstock '99. Scores of thousands in
the almost entirely white audience responded enthusiastically that
they indeed did not care.
</P>
<P>
   Then DMX, one of the most popular rappers today, bounded into a
set of songs written for a black audience, pausing as audience
members shouted back the call-and-response lyrics. Accompanied only
by a disc jockey, DMX went on to rap choruses about drive-by
shootings, lyrics inspired by Satanic mythology and songs asking
the audience if members were killers.
</P>
<P>
   This was not your baby boomer's Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which continues on Saturday and Sunday, is now in
its third incarnation: there was the psychedelic hippie
free-for-all of 1969; the tattooed, pierced alternative rock update
in '94; and this year's installment, which could best be described
as the revenge of hip-hop, or the rise of the white b-boy.
</P>
<P>
   Performing Friday for a crowd of mostly teen-agers sprinkled
with a few hippie leftovers were white acts like Korn, Insane Clown
Posse, and G. Love and Special Sauce, which borrow heavily from
hip-hop; and established black rap acts, including DMX and the
Roots. Even the oldies acts were booked less with Woodstock '69 in
mind and more with an eye toward hip-hop prehistory. They included
the funk showmen James Brown and George Clinton, two of the genre's
biggest influences.
</P>
<P>
   For those walking around the concession stands, Woodstock '99
felt similar to a day on a New Jersey shore boardwalk while the
music was similar to the many rock radio station festivals that
gather the top bands of the moment for shortened sets. In other
words, there were a lot of bands, there were a lot of people, and
there was a lot of heatstroke at Woodstock '99.
</P>
<P>
   But the scale was larger than most recent rock festivals and,
most importantly, the name Woodstock added a veneer of excitement,
authenticity and meaning to the proceedings. It helped create the
feeling that if the crowd isn't creating history, it is at least
making some kind of connection with an event that did.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodstock was a generation reacting against the images of
violence and strife (in Vietnam and at home) they were blitzed with
in the media, then this is a generation trying to replicate what
they've seen in the media, particularly TV and movies. At the
festival in 1994, kids rolled in the mud, thinking they were acting
in the spirit of the original Woodstock film, and singled
themselves out for attention by calling themselves ``mud people.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, so far, there has been no rain: as a result, the few
mud people wandering around on Friday lived their Woodstock fantasy
by rolling around in the cesspool near the portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the rest, the connection was made by young fans
pulling aside grizzled, tie-dyed hippies to take photos with them.
Wavy Gravy, the 1969 Woodstock master of ceremonies, wandered
around with a plastic fish on a leash and a flowing tie-dyed
outfit, surrounded by an enthralled rabble of audience members and
television news crews.
</P>
<P>
   Like the audience, the bands were eager to replicate the
Woodstock they had seen on film. The comedy group the Umbilical
Brothers made jokes about bad acid, even though _ backstage, at
least _ a reporter saw crack being smoked but no acid being taken.
</P>
<P>
   James Brown, after performing an incomprehensible version of
``It's a Man's, Man's, Man's, World,'' urged the crowd to take 30
seconds of silence for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and
sister-in-law, and then asked for a round of applause for the
Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   The English modern soul band Jamiroquai tried in its own way to
make a link with the nudity of Woodstock, leading the crowd in a
chant of ``breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   If walking around naked was an expression of an alternative
community free of society's rules at Woodstock '69, here nude and
topless women were to be ogled at like at a Spring Break event. And
performers were not immune: as the guitarist and singer Sheryl Crow
sang, ``Makes You Happy,'' audience members urged her to lift her
shirt, causing her some consternation on stage. When the crowd
members asked the same of actress Rosie Perez when she was
introducing DMX, she told them to rent ``Do the Right Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Day One of Woodstock pointed to another trait of modern culture:
the dominance of the screen (be it television, computer or movie)
over real life. Throughout the concert, planes soared overhead,
announcements were made from stage, and giant video screens flashed
the news: the video and CD of Woodstock '99 would be in stores this
September. Then, the audience could experience the concert the
right way _ on their television screens _ and shout, like the
Woodstock '69 attendees who returned this year, the generational
rallying cry of belonging: ``I was there!''

FRETT HAS BEEN SPARK FOR SPARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are many reasons for the Los Angeles Sparks'
12-6 start, but perhaps none are more important than the play of
La'Keshia Frett.
</P>
<P>
   Frett, a fourth-round draft pick and former member of the ABL's
Philadelphia Rage, was awarded a starting role four games ago. But
the forward says starting isn't important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care that we win the game and whatever I can do to help us
get that victory, that's all that matters,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the promotion has improved her confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that it hasn't, because when you're sitting over
there and you're watching other people play it's important to keep
that confidence and it's hard to do it at that time. So to be out
here, to be able to play... it reinforces things. It gets you going
again,'' said Frett, who replaced Tamecka Dixon in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-2, Frett gives the Sparks an imposing front court,
along with 6-5 Lisa Leslie and 6-1 DeLisha Milton. Frett plays
small forward, but is versatile enough to play power forward, a
position she played exclusively in her first season with the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   Frett was slowed early in the season following a bout of
tendinitis in her left knee during training camp. The knee still
gets stiff after games, but it hasn't limited her effectiveness.
She got the coaching staff's attention after coming off the bench
to contribute 13 points and eight rebounds in 25 minutes in the
Sparks' win against Phoenix on July 7. Two games later she was in
the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Frett creates many defensive mismatches with her size. In
addition to being agile, she's a good dribbler and passer, makes
few mistakes and has a nice mid-range jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in my career I'm out there trying to do what I
can for my team. I care about doing a good job out there, not
necessarily (scoring) points, because there's more things that you
can do out there like play defense, passing the ball. I try to be
as fundamental as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the Sparks like her.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon's rise chronicled: Tamecka Dixon has a message for young
girls: ``It's OK to be an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon understands the emotional strain and challenges young
girls experience, which was her inspiration for co-writing her
first book, ``You Can Be A Woman Basketball Player,'' (Cascade)
with educational author Judith Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   The book chronicles Dixon's rise from youth basketball to the
WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was always to be the first woman to play in the
NBA,'' Dixon said. ``But then I found out there were opportunities
(for women) to go overseas to play professionally. I had the
opportunity to travel with USA Basketball and travel abroad and see
some of the things they were doing over there. That became my
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA began at the right time for Dixon, a Kodak All-American
at Kansas in 1997, who was selected in the second round of the
inaugural draft by the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon will be doing a reading from her book Sunday from 3:30 to
4:30 p.m. at Borders Bookstore, 6515 Canoga Ave. in Canoga Park.

METS GIVE ROGERS A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE IT IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Texas)  (th) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kenny Rogers is usually perceived as the decent yet
enigmatic pitcher who could not succeed with the Yankees in New
York. Drop him in a low-pressure city like Oakland, Calif., and he
would be effective.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers has long wanted to dispel the notion that he could
only make it elsewhere, and now the left-hander will get the chance
in a different borough, after the Mets acquired him from the
Athletics on Friday for two minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, the $20 million man who struggled in pivotal games with
the Yankees in 1996 and 1997, has been obtained to be one of the
saviors in possibly steering the Mets to their first post-season
berth since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old pitcher, who was sought by many team as next
Saturday's trading deadline nears, pitched a perfect game for the
Texas Rangers in 1994. Friday he gushed that the Mets might be the
``perfect fit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something to prove to myself more than anyone else,''
Rogers said. ``I can pitch a lot better than I did in New York. I
have no doubts about how I pitched or the way I can pitch. I know
I'm better. For me to go back to New York and have the chance to
prove that to myself, that's what I'm looking forward to doing.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a worthwhile move for the Mets because they did not
have to trade Octavio Dotel, their top pitching prospect, or Jason
Isringhausen, another young pitcher they value, and because Rogers
adds a left-handed starter to the staff and gives their blue-chip
infield a pitcher who can induce ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is eligible to become a free agent after the season and
the Mets will pay only the $2 million left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The A's had asked for Isringhausen and a minor league prospect,
but the Mets refused and Oakland accepted the Class AAA outfielder
Terrence Long, a player whose determination has often been
questioned by the organization, and the Class AA pitcher Leoner
Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Rogers shapes up as the Mets' second-best
starter when he arrives Sunday, Manager Bobby Valentine, when asked
about how the Braves might view this trade, stressed that it had
definitely improved the Mets' pursuit of first-place Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a credible left-handed pitcher,'' said Valentine, who
managed Rogers for the pitcher's first three and a half major
league seasons, with the Rangers, for whom Rogers pitched for seven
years before joining the Yankees in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mets did not get a pitcher as prominent as David
Wells, Rogers was 5-3 with a 3.40 earned run average for Oakland,
and General Manager Steve Phillips said that he had secured the
best of what was being peddled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of those pitchers who were available or might become
available, Kenny was at or near the top of the list,'' Phillips
said. ``He fits our club and the National League. To be able to get
him before the trade deadline and to be able do it without having
to move a starting pitcher or upper-level pitcher, I think it is
extraordinary for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite going a deceptive 18-15 with a 5.11 ERA in two seasons
with the Yankees, Rogers never adjusted to the demands of being a
Yankee or playing for the team owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   When Rogers was drilled in the back by a line drive in the
spring of 1996 and concealed the seriousness of the injury from Joe
Torre, the manager was perturbed. When Torre excluded Rogers from
the rotation to open the season, Rogers threatened to ``rip up''
his contract.
</P>
<P>
   While Rogers eventually garnered a 1996 World Series ring, he
was bombed for 11 earned runs in 7 innings in three post-season
starts for the Yankees that year.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers endured back and shoulder injuries and intimated that the
Yankees knew he was pitching in pain, but refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees sent Rogers and $5 million to Oakland for Scott
Brosius after the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers will work out with the Mets on Sunday and the earliest
that he will start is Tuesday against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Valentine said the Mets would use a six-man rotation for at least
one turn now that Rogers was here, a routine that kept the starters
robust for the second half last year.

<P>
   Frank M. Johnson Jr., the legendary federal jurist from Alabama
whose historic civil rights decisions led to ostracism,
cross-burnings and death threats but helped to change the face of
the segregationist South in the 1950s and 1960s, died Friday. He
was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fell last week and was hospitalized in Montgomery, Ala.,
but had returned home. He developed pneumonia, and died at home,
said Wayne Greenhaw, a former reporter and a friend of the family.
No details on services had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   The judge set standards in the South and often in the nation on
voting rights, employment discrimination, affirmative action, and
the rights of mental patients to adequate care and of prison
inmates to protection from inhuman conditions. But it was his knell
for Jim Crow that was revered and reviled.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone old enough to remember, the terrible images are
indelible: the lynched black men, the firebombed churches, crowds
shrieking hatred, a skirmish line of deputies on the Pettus Bridge
at Selma, Ala., peaceful marchers attacked with cattle prods and
snarling police dogs at Birmingham, Ala., and a defiant Gov. George
C. Wallace of Alabama vowing to stand in the schoolhouse door to
bar black children.
</P>
<P>
   In that turbulent era, Johnson loomed as a towering figure _ an
uncompromising defender of civil liberties who came to be known as
the federal judiciary's most influential, innovative and
controversial trial jurist.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed by President Eisenhower a year after the
Supreme Court's school-desegregation decision, Brown vs. Board of
Education. Johnson, a Republican in the Democratic South, arrived
on the bench in Montgomery on Nov. 7, 1955, just as the storm of
the civil rights movement was about to break.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, on Dec. 1, Rosa Parks, a black seamstress,
refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white rider,
as required by city law. Her arrest prompted a bus boycott led by
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a 26-year-old minister who had
just moved to Montgomery for his first pastorate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first major ruling was to join the majority on a
three-judge panel that struck down the Montgomery bus-segregation
law as unconstitutional, applying the principle of Brown vs. Board
of Education: that separate but equal facilities were inherent
violations of the due process and equal-protection clauses of the
14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned almost four decades _ 24 years in U.S.
District Court in Alabama and 13 years in an appeals court with
wide jurisdiction in the South _ Johnson ordered the desegregation
of public schools and colleges, parks, libraries, museums, depots,
airports, restaurants, restrooms and other public places, as well
as the Alabama State Police.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 he issued another historic order that allowed King to
lead a 52-mile march from Selma to Montgomery to protest the denial
of black voting rights. He did so after Alabama troopers clubbed
marchers and used tear gas in a spectacle witnessed on television
by a horrified nation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decisions were legion: He cleared the way for
registering black voters, outlawed poll taxes, struck down state
laws barring blacks and women from jury service, expanded the right
of the poor to court-appointed lawyers, and issued the first court
order for legislative reapportionment in the nation's history,
anticipating the Supreme Court's one-man, one-vote rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark decision, Johnson ordered Alabama to reform its
crowded mental hospitals, and detailed the rights of patients to
decent care. Later, he found barbarous conditions in Alabama's
prisons and threatened to close them unless they were made
habitable.
</P>
<P>
   To many fellow white Alabama residents, he was a traitor. To
segregationists, he became a despised symbol of federal usurpation
of states' rights. Crosses were burned on his lawn twice. His
mother's home was firebombed. For nearly two decades, federal
marshals protected the judge and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Upstaged and outmaneuvered, Gov. Wallace, who had been a law
school classmate of Johnson's at the University of Alabama, called
him an ``integratin', carpetbaggin', scalawaggin', baldfaced
liar.''
</P>
<P>
   But to many, Johnson was a hero. King called him a jurist who
had ``given true meaning to the word justice.'' Time magazine put
his portrait on its cover in 1967 and called him ``one of the most
important men in America.'' In 1980, Bill Moyers devoted two
installments of his television program ``Bill Moyers' Journal'' to
the judge.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, President Carter named Johnson to a seat on the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1995, three years after Johnson
retired, President Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, saying that his ``unwavering commitment to equality under
law helped dismantle segregation and bring our nation closer to the
ideals upon which it was founded.''
</P>
<P>
   A stern, forbidding figure on the bench, Johnson _ tall, gaunt,
with chiseled Lincolnesque features _ never raised his voice in
court, and did not wear a black robe or use a gavel, symbols of
authority he said he did not need.
</P>
<P>
   Away from court, the judge drank bourbon, chewed tobacco, went
fishing and played golf, usually at an Air Force base rather than a
country club where he had been shunned. Invitations to dinner were
rare; there were snubs in church and on the street. But he seemed
untroubled by Montgomery's ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Johnson won a Bronze Star in the Normandy
invasion as a platoon leader in Gen. George Patton's 3rd Army.
Wounded twice in battle, he finished the war as a legal officer in
England and mustered out as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 address, Johnson said, ``I have come to the firm
conclusion that the American people revere the concept of justice,
and their conscience tells them to obey the law once they
understand what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge is survived by his wife, Ruth, whom he married in
1938; a brother, James Noel Johnson, of Montgomery; and two
sisters, Ellen Ruth Harvill of Montgomery, and Mary Ann Bates of
York, Ala.

   Frank M. Johnson Jr., the legendary federal jurist from Alabama
whose historic civil rights decisions led to ostracism,
cross-burnings and death threats but helped to change the face of
the segregationist South in the 1950s and 1960s, died Friday. He
was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson fell last week and was hospitalized in Montgomery, Ala.,
but had returned home. He developed pneumonia, and died at home,
said Wayne Greenhaw, a former reporter and a friend of the family.
No details on services had been announced.
</P>
<P>
   The judge set standards in the South and often in the nation on
voting rights, employment discrimination, affirmative action, the
rights of mental patients to adequate care and of prison inmates to
protection from inhuman conditions. But it was his knell for Jim
Crow that was revered and reviled.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone old enough to remember, the terrible images are
indelible: the lynched black men, the firebombed churches, crowds
shrieking hatred, a skirmish line of deputies on the Pettus Bridge
at Selma, Ala., peaceful marchers attacked with cattle prods and
snarling police dogs at Birmingham, Ala., and a defiant Gov. George
C. Wallace of Alabama vowing to stand in the schoolhouse door to
bar black children.
</P>
<P>
   In that turbulent era, with the national conscience tottering
and a few courageous men and women asking Americans to decide what
kind of people they wanted to be, Johnson loomed as a towering
figure _ an uncompromising defender of civil liberties who came to
be known as the federal judiciary's most influential, innovative
and controversial trial jurist.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed by President Eisenhower a year after the
Supreme Court's school-desegregation decision, Brown vs. Board of
Education. Johnson, a Republican in the Democratic South, arrived
on the bench in Montgomery on Nov. 7, 1955, just as the storm of
the civil rights movement was about to break.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, on Dec. 1, Rosa Parks, a black seamstress,
refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white rider,
as required by city law. Her arrest prompted a bus boycott led by
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., a 26-year-old minister who had
just moved to Montgomery for his first pastorate.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first major ruling was to join the majority on a
three-judge panel that struck down the Montgomery bus-segregation
law as unconstitutional, applying the principle of Brown vs. Board
of Education: that separate but equal facilities were inherent
violations of the due process and equal-protection clauses of the
14th Amendment. He would use that reasoning again and again to
create a broad mandate for racial justice in Alabama and across the
South.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned almost four decades _ 24 years in U.S.
District Court in Alabama and 13 years in an appeals court with
wide jurisdiction in the South _ Johnson ordered the desegregation
of public schools and colleges, parks, libraries, museums, depots,
airports, restaurants, restrooms and other public places, as well
as the Alabama State Police.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 he issued another historic order that allowed King to
lead a 52-mile march from Selma to Montgomery to protest the denial
of black voting rights. He did so after Alabama troopers clubbed
marchers and used tear gas in a spectacle witnessed on television
by a horrified nation, and after President Johnson federalized the
Alabama National Guard to protect the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   When state courts failed to act forcefully to end racial
violence _ as in the case of Viola Liuzzo, a white civil rights
worker from Detroit who was shot to death while riding in a car
with a black man _ Johnson sent the killers to jail on federal
civil rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   His justice was often innovative, even in minor cases. In one,
theft charges were brought against a white man and four black men
that he had hired to help him steal peanuts from a federal
warehouse. The jury acquitted the white man, but convicted the
blacks. Johnson, poker faced, sentenced the black men to 30 minutes
in custody.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decisions were legion: He cleared the way for
registering black voters, outlawed poll taxes, struck down state
laws barring blacks and women from jury service, expanded the right
of the poor to court-appointed lawyers, and issued the first court
order for legislative reapportionment in the nation's history,
anticipating the Supreme Court's one-man, one-vote rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark decision, Johnson ordered Alabama to reform its
crowded, understaffed mental hospitals, and detailed the rights of
patients to decent care. Later, he found barbarous conditions in
Alabama's prisons and threatened to close them unless they were
made habitable and safe for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's voluminous, well-researched opinions often spelled
out detailed standards for his reforms, and in some desegregation
and discrimination cases laid out specific quotas, timetables and
goals that he called ``affirmative action.'' He also appointed
overseers to enforce such orders.
</P>
<P>
   To many fellow white Alabama residents, he was a traitor. To
segregationists, he became a despised symbol of federal usurpation
of states' rights. There were mountains of hate mail and scores of
threatening telephone calls. Crosses were burned on his lawn twice.
His mother's home was firebombed, although she was not hurt. For
nearly two decades, federal marshals protected the judge and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Upstaged and outmaneuvered, Gov. Wallace, who had been a law
school classmate of Johnson's at the University of Alabama, called
him an ``integratin', carpetbaggin', scalawaggin', baldfaced
liar,'' and charged that he was trying to take over the executive
powers of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Name calling aside, a national debate developed on whether
unelected federal judges were intruding too much in state affairs
and assuming too many powers of state and local officials. With
appointees of President Johnson overseeing Alabama schools,
prisons, mental hospitals and elections, the news media began
calling the judge the real governor, and some even said his rule
was preferable to that of Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Johnson insisted that he had intervened only when state and
local officials failed to perform their constitutional duties. ``My
basic philosophy as a trial judge and as an appellate judge is to
follow the law and the facts without regard to the consequences,''
he said once in a rare interview.
</P>
<P>
   And to many, Johnson was a hero. King called him a jurist who
had ``given true meaning to the word justice.'' Time magazine put
his portrait on its cover in 1967 and called him ``one of the most
important men in America.'' In 1980, Bill Moyers devoted two
installments of his television program ``Bill Moyers' Journal'' to
the judge, and said he had ``altered forever the face of the
South,'' and ``earned an enduring place in our history for his
courage and wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, President Carter nominated Johnson to be director of
the FBI. The move was widely acclaimed, but the judge withdrew
after undergoing heart surgery and facing a long recuperation. Two
years later, Carter named him to a seat on the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, three years after Johnson retired with senior judge
status, President Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, saying that his ``unwavering commitment to equality under
law helped dismantle segregation and bring our nation closer to the
ideals upon which it was founded.''
</P>
<P>
   A stern, forbidding figure on the bench, Johnson, _ tall, gaunt,
with chiseled Lincolnesque features _ never raised his voice in
court, and did not wear a black robe or use a gavel, symbols of
authority he said he did not need. He usually worked 11-hour days.
Peering over half-spectacles, the judge, as one lawyer put it,
``looked at you like he was aiming down a rifle barrel.'' But
almost every lawyer who tried a case before him attested to his
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Away from court, the judge drank bourbon, chewed tobacco, went
fishing and played golf, usually at an Air Force base rather than a
country club where he had been shunned. Invitations to dinner were
rare; there were snubs in church and on the street. But he seemed
untroubled by Montgomery's ostracism. He retained a few close
friends, including law clerks, and with a mischievous grin and a
gravelly drawl, he regaled them with the down-home wit of a
back-country storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Minis Johnson Jr. was a back-country boy, and it explained
a great deal about his fierce independence and stoicism. He was
born in the small town of Haleyville, Ala., on Oct. 30, 1918, the
oldest of seven children of Frank and Alabama Long Johnson, who
were farmers and teachers. His father later was a probate judge and
became the only Republican in the Alabama Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson roots were in Winston County, in the remote hills of
northwest Alabama. Long a Republican stronghold, the county
rejected slavery and tried to secede from the state after Alabama
left the Union in 1861. Styling itself as the ``Free State of
Winston,'' it tried to remain neutral in the Civil War, and
eventually sent more men to fight for the Union than the
Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson went to grade school and two years of high school in
Haleyville, but at his parents' insistence he entered the Gulf
Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Miss. After graduating in 1936,
he worked for a year as a surveyor and married Ruth Jenkins of
Winston County. He then attended a state college and a business
school in Birmingham, studying accounting and bookkeeping, before
enrolling at the University of Alabama as a junior in a prelaw
program.
</P>
<P>
   His wife also was a student at the university, and after
graduating she helped to put him through the university law school
by teaching speech therapy in a high school. One of her pupils was
Lurleen Burns, who later married George Wallace and served as
governor when term limits barred him from seeking re-election.
Johnson, who recalled Wallace as the most politically ambitious of
his classmates, graduated at the top of his law school class in
1943.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Army as a private later that year, was
commissioned as an infantry lieutenant and won a Bronze Star in the
Normandy invasion as a platoon leader in Gen. George Patton's 3rd
Army. Wounded twice in battle, he finished the war as a legal
officer in England and mustered out as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Alabama, he settled in Jasper, went into law
practice and soon had a reputation as an excellent criminal defense
attorney. He also got involved in Republican Party politics. By
1952, he headed Alabama Veterans for Eisenhower and became a state
campaign manager in Gen. Eisenhower's winning presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   His reward was appointment in 1953 as the U.S. attorney for
Northern Alabama. He again quickly established an impressive
record, winning a peonage conviction, for example, against two
white planters who had bribed Mississippi jailers to bind over
black prisoners to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he was appointed U.S. district judge for Middle
Alabama, a lifetime post. At age 37, he was the youngest member of
the federal judiciary, and one of a small group of Southern judges
_ Elbert Tuttle, John Minor Wisdom and J. Skelly Wright, among them
_ who had been backed by Eisenhower's campaign manager and attorney
general, Herbert Brownell. Fair, strong-willed, independent and
sensitive to civil rights issues, these men played major roles in
the social and political transformation of the segregationist
South.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson moved into a spartan Workers Project Administration
courtroom on the second floor of the post office in Montgomery, a
federal outpost that flew the Stars and Stripes rather than the
Stars and Bars that topped the Statehouse seven blocks away. It was
to be his court for the next 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike higher court colleagues, federal district judges are
usually part of the local scene, their appointments traceable to
community involvement and local politics, their professional and
social lives intertwined with the local power structure. But to
Montgomery, Johnson was an outsider, a Republican from upstate who
was out of step with old boy traditions. And he was to remain so.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His first big case was the challenge to Montgomery's bus
segregation law, set off by Rosa Parks. Joining Judge Richard Rives
in a majority opinion, he struck down the law as a violation of
constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, and
cited the Supreme Court's 1954 ban on school segregation.
</P>
<P>
   More than a vindication of King's bus boycott, it was the first
time that Brown vs. Board of Education had been applied to a
non-school case, and it cleared the way for eventual desegregation
of public services across the South. It also became a key to
Johnson's judicial development: If a right applied in one area, he
could apply it in another.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 20 years, as the civil rights struggle unfolded,
Johnson _ alone or as part of three-judge panels _ desegregated
schools, parks, depots, airports, museums, libraries, restaurants,
restrooms and other public places and services. In many of the
decisions, his chief opponent was Wallace, who became an Alabama
state judge in 1958 and governor in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   They collided first in 1959, when Wallace impounded records to
impede black voter registration. The records had been subpoenaed by
the federal Civil Rights Commission, and Johnson threatened to hold
Wallace in contempt unless he released them. Wallace complied, but
in a roundabout way that enabled him to remain publicly defiant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, Johnson found a pattern of deliberate discrimination _
trick tests and acts of intimidation _ against blacks in Alabama
voter registration. His remedy was to order the registration of any
black who measured up to the ``least qualified white.'' The formula
became standard in voting cases in the South and was incorporated
by Congress into the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Removing other barriers to voting by blacks, Johnson abolished
Alabama's poll tax, and in 1962 was one of three judges who ordered
the state Legislature reapportioned on a population rather than
geographic basis. It was the first order of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, Johnson and Wallace faced off again as thousands of
militant civil rights marchers led by King descended on Selma for a
protest march to Montgomery. Wallace banned the march as a peril to
public safety, and, in scenes televised to the nation, deputies at
the Pettus Bridge attacked marchers with clubs, tear gas and
electric-shock cattle prods.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered both sides to stand down, then pondered
whether to let the march proceed. The risks were high; Wallace
would not guarantee protection. But after the National Guard was
federalized, Johnson gave the go-ahead, calling the right to march
``commensurate with the enormity of the wrongs that are being
protested.'' He added, ``In this case, the wrongs are enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a peaceful march, but the next day one participant, Viola
Liuzzo, was shot and killed. In the ensuing criminal trial, a
Lowndes County jury acquitted three Ku Klux Klansmen, even though
an FBI informant testified that he saw one defendant commit the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The men were later tried on federal charges of violating the
slain woman's civil rights. When the jury declared itself
deadlocked, Johnson, speaking carefully to avoid a mistrial,
exhorted it to try again, saying the evidence could not be clearer
nor the jurors more intelligent and impartial. The men were then
convicted and the judge sentenced them to the maximum term of 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama State Police never had a black trooper until 1972,
when Johnson ordered an end to ``blatant and continuous
discrimination'' and told the state to hire equal numbers of blacks
and whites until blacks made up a quarter of the 650-member force.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Johnson's most important decisions did not involve race.
In 1971, he found horrific conditions in Alabama's mental
hospitals: thousands of warehoused, tranquilized patients, poorly
fed, unbathed for days, living in reeking, overcrowded quarters,
and no semblance of treatment. His sweeping reforms detailed
precise goals for care and treatment, including staff-patient
ratios, and over the next six years he forced mental health budget
increases, from $16 million to $86 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he ruled that 14 residents of an Alabama school for the
mentally ill had been sterilized in violation of their
constitutional rights in the previous decade. He issued strict
guidelines for such sterilizations, including court approval after
hearings in which incompetent people were represented by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Johnson found Alabama's prisons unfit for habitation,
with inmates packed into unventilated cells, exposed to filth and
rampant violence and deprived of adequate food, sanitation and
medical care. ``The state has a right to convict people for
criminal offenses and send them to the penitentiary, but they were
not sent there to be killed through starvation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered broad reforms that included ``three wholesome
and nutritious meals a day,'' ``a bed off the floor,'' and ``one
toilet per 15 inmates.'' Wallace complained that the reforms were
creating a ``hotel atmosphere'' in the prisons, but the judge
retorted: ``The elimination of conditions that will permit maggots
in a patient's wounds for over a month before his death does not
constitute the creation of a hotel atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alabama officials failed to carry out the reforms, Johnson
appointed a receiver to operate the prisons, and by the 1980s
visitors reported dramatic improvements in sanitation, inmate
education and professional standards.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering from the heart surgery that forced him to
withdraw as the nominee to head the FBI, Johnson returned to the
bench. In a widely noted 1978 case, he ruled that Alabama State
University had discriminated against whites in its hiring
practices. It was the first time that a federal court had found a
black institution guilty of bias against whites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he was elevated by President Carter to the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, with jurisdiction in Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. After a court
reorganization, he later sat on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As an appellate jurist, he placed Alabama's mental health system
under a receivership after concluding that the state had failed to
comply with his reform orders. He also joined a decision that
extended constitutional protections to illegal aliens, overturning
$1,000 tuition fees imposed on each undocumented child by the
school board in Tyler, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also joined in reversing a lower court that had banned
44 textbooks from Alabama public schools in a suit by
fundamentalist Christians, who contended that they promoted a
godless, secular humanism. The textbooks _ in history, social
studies and even home economics _ endorsed no views but tolerance,
self-respect, maturity and self-reliance, he found.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who stepped down in 1992, received the American Bar
Association's first Thurgood Marshall Award in 1993, as the person
``who most exemplifies Justice Marshall's spirit on behalf of
protecting civil rights.'' In Montgomery, where Johnson was once a
pariah, the federal courthouse was named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 address, Johnson reflected on an era that had changed
the South. ``The civilizing function of a judge has been defined, I
think, as `the removal of a sense of injustice,''' he said. ``I
have come to the firm conclusion that the American people revere
the concept of justice, and their conscience tells them to obey the
law once they understand what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge is survived by his wife, Ruth, whom he married in
1938; a brother, James Noel Johnson, of Montgomery; and two
sisters, Ellen Ruth Harvill of Montgomery, and Mary Ann Bates, of
York, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   He was the subject of three biographies: ``Taming the Storm: The
Life and Times of Frank M. Johnson Jr. and the South's Fight Over
Civil Rights,'' by Jack Bass (Doubleday, 1993); ``Judge Frank
Johnson and Human Rights in Alabama,'' by Tinsley E. Yarbrough
(University of Alabama Press, 1981), and ``Judge Frank M. Johnson
Jr.: A Biography,'' by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (Putnam, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, whose father was assassinated in 1968, went to
Montgomery in 1977 to write about Wallace, but switched subjects
and during a year in Alabama developed a close relationship with
Frank and Ruth Johnson, whose adopted son, Johnny, had died in 1975
at age 28. ``I was awestruck,'' Kennedy said. ``Here was a man who
utterly vindicated my family's central notion that a single man can
make a difference.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Crackdowns on those who oppose President Alexander
Lukashenko of Belarus have led the chief opposition figure to flee
to Lithuania after his supporters voted him acting president and
proclaimed the Lukashenko government at an end.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition leader, Semyon Sharetsky, a former speaker of
Parliament, apparently feared for his safety during a new
government crackdown on critics, who charge that Lukashenko has
illegally extended his rule, which originally was to have ended
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Sharetsky and I went by car to Vilnius,'' the
former President Stanislav Shushkevich said in an interview Friday
evening, ``and today I returned. Sharetsky has remained there for
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharetsky was the speaker of the Belarus Parliament in 1996 when
Lukashenko nullified the nation's first constitution, disbanded the
Parliament and extended his own term by two years, to 2001.
Lukashenko acted after staging a national referendum that most
international observers say was rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Shushkevich, who was the first president of Belarus after it
gained independence, said the two men went to Lithuania to seek
backing from political leaders for their opposition to the
Lukashenko government, and that it was unclear when Sharetsky would
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally was trying to get him out of here in order to
ensure his safety,'' Shushkevich said.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko remains the most popular politician in Belarus, but
his Soviet-style rule has been distinguished by an increasingly
dysfunctional economy and, critics say, growing political
repression.
</P>
<P>
   Under the nullified constitution, Lukashenko's term in office
would have expired on Tuesday, and the police have cracked down on
protests by dissidents several times this week. On Tuesday, a
peaceful March by about 1,000 protesters was followed by the arrest
of a dozen dissidents and the opening of a criminal investigation
of the editor of a popular opposition newspaper, Imya.
</P>
<P>
   The editor, Irina Khalip, said Friday that she was accused of
defamation after the newspaper printed allegations about a month
ago that top government officials had ties to organized crime.
Although she has not been arrested, she said in an interview
Friday, her apartment and the offices of Imya were searched on
Thursday, and she was questioned until late that evening by state
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Khalip is scheduled to go to the United States later this
month for a cross-country series of seminars on the American news
media sponsored by the U.S. Information Agency. Prosecutors
initially seized her passport, she said, but later returned it and
said she was free to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I'd be called in for questioning after my return,
and I gather the question of the measures to be taken against me
will be decided then,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the police dogged an unauthorized protest by about
2,500 people in downtown Minsk's October Square and arrested 53
more critics, including some members of the disbanded Parliament.
Authorities said that they were later released, but opposition
officials cast doubt on that, saying that many had not returned to
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday the police arrested a leading human rights
activist, Valery Shchukin, as he stood with the head of the group
monitoring human rights for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Sharetsky is the leading figure in the week's protests, the
speaker of the Supreme Soviet, the former National Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The new pro-Lukashenko legislature, the National Assembly,
absorbed many members of the old Soviet, but those who refused to
join have become a focus of what little political opposition still
exists.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 35 members of the old parliament decreed that
Sharetsky was acting president under the old constitution, which
provides for the speaker to fill any presidential vacancy until new
presidential elections are held.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman called on Lukashenko to hold free elections for
Parliament and to open negotiations with opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko appears to have reacted to the week's events with
mounting irritation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he said he would negotiate only with constructive
opponents, excluding ``the political bankrupts who ruined the
country'' before he came to power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And he asserted that he has no intention of leaving power
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not yet done everything, and that is why I will be in
power for a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he appeared on live television with the head of the
state-controlled television network, whom he excoriated for
allowing the broadcast of videotape of the week's protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of people came, of whom 600 were police in
plainclothes,'' he said. ``They walked and walked, got tired and
then they went home. And you show that to a whole country.''

QWEST'S GAME OF AGGRESSIVE PHONE TAG  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 25)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a balmy Saturday in mid-June, 70 of Joseph P. Nacchio's
closest friends and family members gathered at his northern New
Jersey home for boccie ball and a late supper to celebrate his
son's high school graduation. Also attending were a few colleagues,
including Jack Grubman, who had worked with Nacchio at AT&AMP;T years
before.
</P>
<P>
   Grubman, now a top telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney, had helped advise Global Crossing on its recent mergers
with U S West Inc., the smallest regional Bell company, and the
Frontier Corp., the nation's No. 5 long-distance company, based in
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Global, like many young telecommunications concerns these days,
hopes to use fiber optic cables to transmit data over the Internet.
U S West and Frontier would give it what it needed most: revenue
and customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the rumor on Wall Street the week before the party was that
one of Global's rivals, Qwest Communications International, was on
the verge of making unsolicited offers for the two companies. If
true, it made for an awkward situation on Nacchio's backyard deck:
Nacchio is Qwest's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of speculation out there about when you are
going to come with an offer,'' Grubman said at the party, a swing
band playing in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio said he replied with a shrug, ``We may, we may not.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio was in fact about to embark on the largest double
hostile takeover in American history. As he crawled into bed that
evening, he was almost giddy. ``I think we both had a lot of
trouble sleeping that night,'' said his wife, Anne Esker Nacchio,
``not because we were worried, but because we were excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Qwest made offers to buy both U S West and
Frontier for a total of $55 billion in stock and cash, in effect
topping Global's stock offer of $47 billion. Soon, scores of
bankers, lawyers and negotiators began shuttling between Denver,
where both Qwest and U S West are based, and lawyers' offices in
New York as often as commuters on a subway.
</P>
<P>
   The result was last Sunday's compromise, for U S West to merge
with Qwest and for Global Crossing to acquire Frontier _ a deal
that most analysts agree gives each company the prize it needed
most.
</P>
<P>
   But what many participants had hoped might be worked out
amicably in days, instead took weeks of almost Machiavellian
maneuvering. Clandestine meetings were held in airport hangars and
hotel rooms, far from prying eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared as the battle at times seemed personal. And
Denver's most celebrated billionaire was forced to step in and
broker not one but two vital relationships. Without his effort a
compromise might never have been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is savoring the victories, however, especially
investors in Qwest and Global Crossing; each stock has tumbled,
with Qwest closing on Friday 42 percent off its 52-week high, and
Global 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite being a sensible solution, this is not a happy one for
everyone involved,'' said one person involved in the talks. ``A lot
of value was lost by investors in this whole escapade.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio was a little nervous as he drove to the offices of Kekst
&AMP; Co., a New York public relations firm, on Sunday, June 13, the
morning after the graduation party, where he planned to announce
the offers.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's bid was simple: The company was willing to pay $55
billion in stock and cash for both U S West and Frontier, about 22
percent more than Global Crossing's all-stock offer was worth based
on the previous Friday's closing prices.
</P>
<P>
   The move was risky; not only was Qwest trying two hostile
takeovers at once, but both targets had signed merger agreements
with Global Crossing months before that would be tough and
expensive to break.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio, who grew up in a scrappy Italian neighborhood on Staten
Island, attacks competitors with a take-no-prisoners style. But
even his friends say that sometimes his abrasive personality makes
him an easy target for detractors. He was recently described in The
Economist as having ``all the swagger and verbal braggadocio of Joe
Pesci's mobster in the film `Goodfellas.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio took offense to the stereotype, and wrote a letter to
the magazine in response: ``The overwhelming majority of
Italian-Americans are not mobsters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The day Qwest announced its bids, Nacchio recalled, ``I had a
lot of adrenaline flowing.'' Minutes before the news release went
out, he called Joseph P. Clayton, chief executive of Frontier, to
tell him of the bid. Philip F. Anschutz, the secretive billionaire
who owns 39 percent of Qwest and is chairman, called Solomon D.
Trujillo, chief executive of U S West. Nacchio thought a call from
Anschutz, whom Trujillo knew, might ``take the edge off,'' he later
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo, for his part, turned down several requests in recent
weeks to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Qwest's offer, though unwelcome, came as no surprise
to executives at Global Crossing. They had worried that Qwest and a
partner might enter the bidding war. Global's top management
conferred immediately with its advisers at Salomon, but there was
little to do except wait and see how investors reacted.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Annunziata, the chief executive, was barred from
commenting publicly about Frontier and U S West until Global filed
documents with regulators. And, anyway, Global had a provision in
its merger contracts that allowed it to review any competing bid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Qwest investors revolted. On Monday, the day after
the announcement, the shares collapsed 24 percent, to $34.125, in
record trading volume. That was troubling for Qwest, because the
company was offering its own stock as currency. When the stock
price dropped, so did the value of its dual offer, making it almost
comparable to Global Crossing's. Nacchio and his advisers had
clearly miscalculated the market response.
</P>
<P>
   As one investment banker not involved in the deals said at the
time, ``This will be a Harvard Business School case study someday
on how not to launch a hostile takeover.''
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's attempt to promote the deal during that week's roadshow
was equally disastrous. Investors bought Qwest with the promise of
owning a supercharged growth company. But if Nacchio bought U S
West, Qwest's growth rate would be halved. ``I think the whole
strategy is absurd,'' said Robert Gensler of T. Rowe Price, the
mutual fund company in Baltimore, one of many analysts to balk at
the move.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Nacchio got back to his Denver office on Thursday,
June 17, he had 600 e-mail messages waiting. No one, Nacchio said,
seemed to understand Qwest's rationale, least of all the news
media. ``Business Week has a story coming out, and you are not
going to like it,'' Nacchio recalled a board member telling him
that Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio had been interviewed, he said, but instead of a news
article, the magazine published an editorial criticizing his bids,
calling him ``a telecom bureaucrat dressed up in Internet
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio did not mask his anger. In a conference call with
advisers later that afternoon, he lashed out. ``What is going on
here?'' he barked, according to one person on the call. ``Why can't
we get any good press?'' Nacchio later told aides to try to set up
meetings with top editors at major news outlets so he could explain
his plan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio said he thinks some news accounts were planted by Global
to try to undermine his offers. ``It demonstrated they hadn't done
their homework on me, and I wasn't going to back down,'' he said.
He called the stories ``hurtful.'' ( Annunziata of Global Crossing
said neither he nor any of his executives planted negative
reports.)
</P>
<P>
   But Nacchio's public relations campaign did little to sway the
audience he needed most. On June 17, Frontier reaffirmed its merger
with Global Crossing, which is based in Bermuda; four days later, U
S West did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Their message was clear: Sweeten the offers or go away.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, nine days after Qwest made its offers, Nacchio was
awakened by a telephone call from Anschutz, Qwest's largest
shareholder, wishing him a happy 50th birthday. ``How do you
feel?'' Nacchio said Anschutz asked him. ``Tired,'' Nacchio
replied, ``but I'm not sure if it's age or if it is this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio and his negotiating team, which included Craig Slater,
who is one of Anschutz's trusted advisers, had begun a ``Dear Sol''
letter-writing campaign to pressure Trujillo of U S West to accept
Qwest's offer. Instead, advisers say they annoyed him, and Trujillo
demanded that they stop.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest was also planning to make revised offers that were more
palatable, but exactly how was up in the air. Among other things, U
S West wanted protection in case Qwest's volatile stock plummeted
further.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio and Anschutz discussed several different options _ more
stock or a guarantee of cash, perhaps _ and decided to keep Qwest's
board members on standby in case a quick vote was needed on a
revised bid. By day's end, it was: Frontier shareholders would be
offered a guaranteed $48 in stock and $20 in cash, and U S West
shareholders $69 in stock, for each share.
</P>
<P>
   The total value of the offers _ about $50 billion _ was not as
rich as the first, but seemed better than Global Crossing's. And
both companies' stockholders would be protected from volatile price
swings as well, something Qwest hadn't offered originally. Qwest
planned to make its revised offer the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio, who had been working at home in his library, took a few
hours off that night for a quiet barbecue with his wife and two
sons. (Their birthday gifts to him that day included the
``Godfather'' trilogy on video and a promise to wash and wax his
Porsche.) And he called Grubman of Salomon, in part to send a
message to Global to back off.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio was still fuming about the Business Week editorial, and
he said he told Grubman that ``it was a bad tactic for Global to go
after me personally.'' He also told Grubman that another bid was
coming, saying, as Grubman recalled it and Nacchio confirmed, ``I'm
going to drop a ton of bricks on your heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The new bids posed a problem for Global Crossing. Its founder,
Gary Winnick _ a financier and a former colleague of Michael R.
Milken _ had turned a $15 million investment in an undersea cable
into more than $5 billion of Global stock. For Global to succeed,
it needed the cash and customers Frontier and U S West could
provide. Winnick's biggest fear was losing Frontier, because he
coveted its long-distance network.
</P>
<P>
   He knew it would be inappropriate to approach Qwest directly
about a compromise, so on the afternoon of June 26, according to
people close to the talks, he stopped by the Malibu home of a
trusted friend, Ken Moelis, a Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
executive in Los Angeles. The two walked on the beach, and Winnick
asked Moelis: Could he help with Anschutz?
</P>
<P>
   Moelis, who was not advising Qwest, called Lou Friedman, another
Donaldson banker who was, and told him about the visit. Maybe a
deal could work, Moelis thought. Qwest, the nation's fourth-largest
long-distance company, was interested in U S West mainly for its
local customers. And Frontier, while important, was less vital to
its strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It took executives and bankers two days to negotiate a meeting
of about eight Qwest and Global executives and advisers at the
O'Hare Hilton in Chicago on June 30. ``Everyone was terrified,''
one person close to the talks said. ``No one trusted each other.
They didn't want leaks. The implication was it would show
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two camps convened at 10 a.m. in room 3002, a Salomon
banker laid out Global's concerns first: Winnick was prepared to
give U S West permission to negotiate with Qwest as long as Qwest
was willing to drop its bid for Frontier that day. No way, said
Slater, Anschutz's adviser. ``This isn't going to be unilateral
disarmament,'' he said, according to people who were there. ``It's
trust, but we'll keep our nuclear weapons pointed at you.'' Slater
said Qwest would drop its bid for Frontier only when a deal with U
S West was struck.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours, the two teams bickered. ``Part of the negotiation
with Global Crossing was helping Qwest get in to U S West to
talk,'' said one person close to the talks. ``U S West could have
hidden behind legal issues if it wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   By noon, Slater and his team were so frustrated that they
threatened to walk out of the negotiations and called their pilot
to fetch them. But after three more exhausting hours, they were no
closer to a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of calls were made over the next 24 hours to both
Winnick and Anschutz. Those led to an informal understanding on
July 1 that allowed U S West to negotiate with Qwest as long as
Qwest agreed to drop its bid for Frontier when a deal with U S West
was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Global would receive half its original $850 million
breakup fee. That afternoon, Winnick and Anschutz confirmed the
informal understanding by telephone. Later that day, U S West said
it would begin talks with Qwest. Frontier also said it would hold
talks with Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement between Qwest and U S West might never have been
reached without the stealthy maneuverings of Anschutz, the
press-shy Denver billionaire who made his fortune in oil and
railroad investments. Most recently, he sold the Southern Pacific
Railroad in 1996 for $5.4 billion, tripling his $1.8 billion
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Like Winnick, he is guarded and private, driven to finding
opportunities where none are clear. But in this case, his
motivation was self-evident: to further protect his 39 percent
investment in Qwest, which since June 13 had lost one-quarter of
its value. As the largest shareholder, he had the most to gain in
welcoming Trujillo into the Qwest fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Anschutz and Winnick, they want to make money,''
said one person involved in the talks. ``They don't want to be
known as the guys who remade the telecommunications industry.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because U S West had originally approached Global about a merger
of equals, it was not technically for sale. So Trujillo and his
board were demanding a merger with equal power. One concern was
that Qwest had no experience running a local telephone business.
And Trujillo wanted to make sure that his ideas and those of his
management team would get an equal airing once the companies were
combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``U S West was concerned about Qwest slashing and burning its
management team,'' a person close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, mutual suspicion pervaded every aspect of the
negotiations, to the point that seemingly trivial details like a
demand by Trujillo to drop a sentence and move a paragraph in the
news release would snag the deal's signing for hours. (He prevailed
on the sentence, which said he would report to Nacchio; the
paragraph, explaining each of the top executives' titles,
ultimately stayed put.)
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz began talking about management issues with Trujillo on
Thursday, July 8. One solution discussed was to name Trujillo
president of the local and wireless business and a vice chairman of
the combined company. But that was a nonstarter; U S West feared
that a vice chairmanship would be perceived as one step away from
early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between executives in New York stalled over the weekend,
too. Slater was running in Central Park on Saturday when he
received a call on his cell phone from Allan R. Spies, U S West's
chief financial officer, informing him that the day's planned
negotiations might be postponed, said a person close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Slater and his team went to the offices of Davis Polk &AMP;
Wardwell, the lawyers advising Qwest, to await Spies' call. The
meeting never happened, and Qwest's advisers ended up watching the
Women's World Cup soccer finals on a television in the law office
library.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after discussions began in earnest, negotiators struck
paydirt. Slater and Spies, along with two other executives from
Qwest and U S West, met at U S West's hangar at a small airport
outside Denver on July 12. The four men mulled over a compromise
that had surfaced earlier: naming Anschutz, Nacchio and Trujillo
co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio would still be chief executive. But to make that
palatable, Trujillo would have the authority to present his own
ideas to the board, even if Nacchio disagreed. Trujillo would be
named president of the local and wireless business. And top jobs at
the combined entity would be divided equally between executives
from the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz didn't love the concept at first. ``Phil thought the
market would perceive him as an arbitrator,'' said one person close
to the talks. ``He was the referee, and he didn't want to be.'' But
he soon warmed to the idea, as did Nacchio, who was traveling that
day. Later that afternoon, Anschutz went to Trujillo's office, and
the two men agreed that it was an arrangement they all could live
with.
</P>
<P>
   With management issues all but behind them, negotiators spent
several long days and late nights _ until the boards' meetings on
Friday night _ working out the details.
</P>
<P>
   The drama of Qwest's battle for U S West overshadowed the story
of Frontier. After preliminary discussions stalled, Rolla P. Huff,
president and chief operating officer, said he called Nacchio on
July 13 _ the same day Nacchio and Trujillo had dinner at the Brown
Palace Hotel in downtown Denver to discuss their future _ to gauge
whether he was serious about buying Frontier. Nacchio said he was,
but Huff said he suspected then, as he does now, that Nacchio was
not as interested in Frontier as he was in U S West.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Qwest and Global Crossing compromise was greeted
with little fanfare on Wall Street. Analysts called it the logical
outcome, as did the principals.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we thought U S West was good, but we
had our limits on what it was worth,'' said Annunziata of Global
Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio said, ``It was OK to let Frontier go.''
</P>
<P>
   Communications companies, like Qwest and Global, are aware that
if they do not transform themselves _ placing one foot in the new
digital universe of the Internet and the other in the traditional
world of cable or copper wires _ they risk likely death. In
essence, that is at the core of the brawl for Frontier and U S
West.
</P>
<P>
   But betting on an unpredictable future takes its toll. ``I'm
just physically tired,'' Nacchio said, sounding weary on a
telephone call on Thursday from Boston, one of several cities he
visited on a whirlwind roadshow to discuss the merger. `'I've only
seen my wife three times in the past three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio says he is confident that Qwest's merger with U S West
will succeed. But it will be several years before he, or Qwest
investors, know for sure. Still, ``Qwest can never be the same,''
Nacchio said. ``Once we started, we knew we could never go back to
what we were before.''

<P>
   It's no secret that after a spell of subpar performance, some of
the largest funds managed by Fidelity Investments have rebounded
and begun to beat their benchmarks consistently.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity executives have a better reason to cheer. With that
turnaround, some of these funds _ including the $100 billion
Magellan fund _ have begun generating more each month in management
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The difference has meant that Magellan alone paid Fidelity an
additional $5 million or so in fees in June. And if the giant fund
can stay even with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index through
the end of the year, Fidelity will collect an extra $10 million, or
so, each month compared with what it would if it still trailed the
index significantly.
</P>
<P>
   The overall management fee is much bigger: In the fiscal year
ended in March, the fund paid Fidelity an average of $27.2 million
in monthly management fees.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money, of course, flows to the coffers of Fidelity's
parent, the FMR Corp., a closely held company controlled by the
family of Edward C. Johnson III.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Fidelity is raising prices for Magellan
investors; rather, it is rebating less to them than it has been
because its performance has improved, compared with the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity is one of the few fund companies that use performance
fees, meaning that it reaps more in fees when its fund's results
surpass a benchmark index like the S&AMP;P 500 or the Russell 2000. But
the Securities and Exchange Commission requires fund companies that
use performance fees to rebate the same percentage amount to
investors if funds lag behind their benchmarks over a specified
period. In the case of Magellan and other Fidelity funds, the
period is the trailing three years.
</P>
<P>
   So while Magellan has beaten the S&AMP;P 500 lately, it has still
been rebating fees to investors because of its poor performance
that began late in 1995 and continued into the next year. The
fund's manager at that time, Jeffrey N. Vinik, who had beaten the
S&AMP;P 500 during his first three years at Magellan, put about
one-third of its assets into cash and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that and other portfolio moves, Fidelity trailed
the S&AMP;P 500 in the first half of 1996 by almost seven percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three fiscal years, Fidelity has forfeited $303.7
million in management fees because of Magellan's poor performance
in relation to the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   The tide appears to have changed. ``We're definitely catching
up,'' said David Jones, an FMR vice president. ``Fair is fair. We
take the hit in bad times.''
</P>
<P>
   Because companies must pay out as much for bad performance as
they stand to gain from doing well, such fees are tricky. According
to Lipper Inc., the research firm, only 150 funds use them _ and
funds managed by Fidelity, Vanguard and American Express' IDS
account for almost two-thirds of that group.
</P>
<P>
   Fund families that favor performance fees say investors would be
better off if rival families did likewise. ``They help align
shareholders' interests and managements' interests,'' said Jeffrey
S. Molitor, director of portfolio review at Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the others lack courage. But maybe, they are just smart.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong performance that many active managers posted
in the second quarter, it has been six years since a majority of
actively managed funds topped the S&AMP;P 500 for a full year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for the first six months of this year, almost two out
of three active managers of general equity funds failed to beat the
index, according to Lipper. While this does not account for funds
that may track, and beat, other benchmark indexes, it suggests that
most actively managed funds have a long way to go before
performance fees will add up to a good deal for fund companies.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Fidelity's offerings, few other large funds use
performance fees. One is Vanguard's $18 billion Windsor fund, whose
value style lagged behind the market last fiscal year, and which
paid a measly 4 basis points _ that is 4 cents for every $100 of
investor money _ to the fund's adviser, Wellington Management,
primarily because of negative performance-fee adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, there is one formula at Fidelity for
calculating the fees in funds that use them: The company gets to
add two-hundredths of a percentage point to its expense ratio for
every percentage point by which a fund's three-year cumulative
total return beats that of its benchmark. And it subtracts the same
amount for every point by which it lags its index. (The calculation
is done monthly.)
</P>
<P>
   The funds' benchmarks vary. Most domestic diversified funds use
the S&AMP;P 500 or the Russell 2000. Only the first 10 percentage
points of relative divergence are used in making the calculations.
And the fees are charged not on current assets, but on average
assets over the prior three years.
</P>
<P>
   Some fund experts wonder whether Fidelity will do away with
performance fees.
</P>
<P>
   They note that Fidelity recently asked for, and received,
shareholder approval to eliminate performance fees at the Fidelity
Destiny I and Destiny II funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity officials say they plan to stick with the system.
``We think performance fees are a good idea,'' FMR's Jones said.
``It's a position we staked out a long time ago.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   King Hassan II, who ruled Morocco for 38 years, prolonging the
life of a 300-year-old dynasty in an era when monarchies in Libya,
Egypt, Iraq and Iran fell to Socialist revolutions or the force of
militant Islam, died Friday in Rabat, Morocco. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, Crown Prince Sidi
Mohammed, the king's 36-year-old son and successor, announced on
state television. The king, who had been in fragile health since he
was hospitalized in the United States four years ago for lung
problems, had been admitted earlier in the day to the Avicenne
hospital Rabat, the capital, for an acute lung infection, according
to a statement issued by the palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I announce to the Arab and Islamic nations and to the whole
world the death of a great leader and a man of this world's great
men,'' the crown prince said in a brief message on state television
in which he asked the Moroccan people for ``calm and patience.''
Moroccan television said that his funeral would be held on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies considered Hassan one of the
most Western-oriented of Arab leaders, a ruler who outmaneuvered
Islamic militants in his own country and who stood out among his
peers for his openness to rapprochement with Israel. Through the
years he acted as a go-between in Middle East diplomacy, helping to
arrange a visit to Jerusalem in 1977 by Egypt's leader, Anwar
Sadat, and, during the 1980s, meeting with the Israeli leaders
Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres when other Arabs shunned them.
</P>
<P>
   A master at managing Morocco's complex quilt of ethnic and
ideological forces, he maintained a hold on power that was by turns
iron-fisted and deftly offhand. He survived half a dozen
assassination attempts and uprisings. On one occasion, he
intimidated the leader of rebel troops by looking him in the eye
and reciting the first verse of the Koran. Another time, when
pilots of his own air force attacked his Boeing 727 jetliner, the
king, himself a pilot, seized the radio and shouted, ``Stop firing,
the tyrant is dead,'' fooling the rebels into breaking off their
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The heir to the Alawite dynasty that claimed direct descent from
the Prophet Mohammed and ruled the Sharifian empire of the Western
Sahara, Hassan II was the author of Morocco's first constitution.
But he was at heart an autocrat, and democracy waxed and waned at
his pleasure. He tolerated opposition parties and a relatively free
press that could offer opinions on policy matters. But criticism of
the monarchy was forbidden and his ruthlessness in crushing
opponents was severely criticized by human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Economic and political reform proceeded steadily through his
years in power, and though the pace was slower than his critics
would have liked, said William Zartman, director of African Studies
at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, many would agree that the
country was better off during the final years of his reign than it
was when he first came to power.
</P>
<P>
   His success lay in an ability to be different things to
different people. He kept Morocco's elite content with royal
patronage and instituted market-oriented reforms that improved the
lives of the urban middle class. He used his position as
``Commander of the Faithful'' to woo the rural peasantry,
quadrupled the number of mosques and constructed the world's
largest, the Great Mosque of Hassan the II.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had deep understanding from the early days of the tribal
mentality of Morocco and the importance of the throne as a unifying
force,'' said Robert H. Pelletreau, a former assistant secretary of
state for near eastern affairs, who knew the king well. ``He was a
superb student, and he could be exceedingly charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Moroccans said of Hassan that he had ``baraka,'' or
``blessedness, '' an Arabic expression for a charismatic person
blessed with divine protection. Yet, when he ascended the throne on
Feb. 26, 1961, most observers expected him to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Moulay Hassan ben Mohammed Alaoui was born on July 9, 1929, the
oldest of six children of Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef. Most of
Morocco was then a protectorate of France, except for sections
governed by Spain in the northwest and southern coast and the city
of Tangier, an international zone.
</P>
<P>
   As World War II unfolded, resistance to colonial rule grew.
After the fall of France, the Free-French forces promised
independence if Morocco would cooperate in the war against the
Axis, a promise that Paris would prove unwilling to keep.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, tension rose between the sultan and the French,
but the young prince was educated as befitted the heir of two
traditions. He attended the imperial college at Rabat, where
instruction was in Arabic and French. Later, he earned a law degree
from the University of Bordeaux and served in the French navy
aboard the battleship Jeanne d'Arc.
</P>
<P>
   But his father's agitation for Moroccan self-government
continued, and in 1953 the French forced the sultan into exile. In
1954 and 1955, as rioting and guerrilla warfare increased, Hassan's
father regained his title, and the following year Morocco won
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan worked with his father, now Mohammed V, to maintain the
monarchy's authority amid rising social discontent and the
conflicting expectations of those who had fought for Moroccan
independence. In 1957, he became the commander in chief of the
Moroccan army, which was splintered between officers who had been
loyal to the French and the former rebels. Hassan kept the military
occupied with civilian projects, and led it to victory against
rebel Berber tribesmen in the Rif mountains in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   But in the shantytowns of Rabat, Casablanca and other cities,
opposition simmered against the royal house. Though the monarchy
looked to Paris and Washington for financial support, it needed to
placate the leftist opposition. Declaring neutrality in the Cold
War, the prince made overtures to Moscow and accepted Soviet
military aid. ``As an Islamic People,'' he told the Associated
Press in 1961, ``we have the right to practice bigamy. We can wed
East and West and be faithful to both.''
</P>
<P>
   Such comments caused consternation in Western capitals. So did
the reputation of the young prince, who the Western press often
portrayed as a playboy who liked gambling and was overly concerned
with his wardrobe.

HERE, KITTY, KITTY _ TEENS, ADULTS FUEL SALES OF JAPANESE ICON  &HT;     BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Erin Rusher, 20, wore a small silver hoop in her
nose and dark sunglasses atop her head. But what she was lacking,
what she really needed to complete her look, was some Hello Kitty
gear.
<P>
   ``Hello Kitty is really cool,'' Rusher explained while picking
through pink-and-white, sweet-as-you-please Kitty stuff at the
Sanrio store near Union Square in San Francisco. ``She makes you
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   That combination of cool and cuddly is fueling a worldwide boom
in sales of Hello Kitty goods. While as popular as ever &LR;   &LR; with
children, Hello Kitty has been rediscovered by teens and young
adults, who are again embracing one of the more quirky emblems of
their youth.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, Hello Kitty is a button-nosed, red-ribboned
feline character concocted by Japan's Sanrio Co. 25 years ago to
serve as the centerpiece of a vast marketing machine.
</P>
<P>
   While Hello Kitty doesn't star in movies or have her own weekly
TV show, she has nevertheless gained a huge following over the
years. According to Sanrio's Web site, ``Her hobbies include
traveling, music, reading, eating yummy cookies her sister Mimi
bakes, and best of all making new friends.''
</P>
<P>
   She has lots of those.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Hello Kitty goods are the must-have items of the
moment among trendy women in their 20s and 30s. There has been talk
in the Japanese media of a ``Kitty addiction'' compelling women _
and more than a few men _ to purchase everything from Hello Kitty
cell phones to Hello Kitty clothing.
</P>
<P>
   While full-on Kitty addiction has yet to take hold on this side
of the Pacific, Sanrio's U.S. subsidiary, based in South San
Francisco, Calif., says sales are ``going through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much since day one, Kitty has been our star
attraction,'' said Bill Hensley, the company's marketing manager.
``It's her sincerity and honesty. She promotes love and
friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   And drug use. But we'll get to that.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, Hello Kitty accounts for about 60 percent of Sanrio's
total sales, which reached approximately $1.2 billion in the latest
fiscal year. Sales of Hello Kitty products in particular have risen
30 percent worldwide from 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Hello Kitty racked up $25 million in sales
in the fiscal year ended March 31, a 65-percent increase from the
previous year. Sanrio's U.S. subsidiary is projecting total 1999
sales of $80 million, up from $72 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello Kitty is an attractive girls' property,'' said Hayley
Kissel, a retail industry analyst with Merrill Lynch. ``South Park,
the Simpsons, Pokemon _ a lot of the licensed properties tend to
appeal to boys more.''
</P>
<P>
   John Glass, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, sees the
Hello Kitty phenomenon as having a cosmopolitan flair. ``More
affluent Boomer parents are seeking more international
influences,'' he said. ``Hello Kitty is Japanese. She has more
panache than Barbie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask anyone with even a passing interest in Hello Kitty what the
attraction is, and the first answer that inevitably comes up is
``cute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's real cute,'' said Mika Takeuchi, 26, examining Hello
Kitty stickers at the Sanrio store. ``I love Hello Kitty. I've been
buying Hello Kitty since I was a little girl in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Takeuchi now works for a commercial real estate firm in San
Francisco. But that hasn't prevented her from indulging her passion
for all things Kitty. As proof, she held up her thumb, which was
adorned with a tiny Hello Kitty decal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She appeals to all ages,'' Takeuchi said. ``Look at me. I'm
working, and I still love Hello Kitty.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the majority of shoppers encountered recently at the
Sanrio store were in their teens or older. At the nearby Disney
Store, where reporters are politely asked not to interview the
``guests,'' just about every adult present had a small child in
tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cater to a high age target at our store,'' said Sarah
Aldana, manager of the Sanrio outlet. ``We have more adults
shopping here than kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She speculated that Hello Kitty reminds many grown-ups of their
childhood and ``gives them a sense of being young again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We also we have a large amount of people who are into the club
and rave scene,'' Aldana added.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Hello Kitty, along with other Sanrio
characters (like the penguin Badtz-Maru), have an especially avid
following among the party crowd known as ``candy ravers.'' These
are teens and adults who favor childlike dress and accessories when
out dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello Kitty is really cool,'' said Sasha Roberts, 18, a
self-professed candy raver. ``A lot of people have Hello Kitty
tattooed on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Roberts, though. She rolled up a leg of her jeans to reveal
a tattoo on her ankle of two other Sanrio characters, Kiki and
Lala, the Little Twin Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' companion, 18-year-old Lamar Brown, said Hello Kitty
can be found ``anywhere there's drugs.'' Then he corrected himself.
``Anywhere there's ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy, the drug of choice among ravers, makes people feel
drawn to ``anything colorful or sparkly,'' Brown explained. Because
Hello Kitty favors bright colors, this is a lure for ecstasy users,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecstasy puts you in a state of mind that's loving and trusting
and peaceful,'' said Simon Reynolds, author of ``Generation
Ecstasy,'' a book about rave culture. ``The whole atmosphere of
raves is this regression to childlike wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   While many veteran ravers tend to scoff at their candy-colored
cousins, Reynolds observed that candy raving has grown in
popularity over the past year. He attributed this to rave music
becoming ``happier and bouncier'' and to ``a return of high-quality
ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Sanrio's Hensley had a different take on Hello
Kitty's popularity. While acknowledging that Kitty ``is very big in
the club scene,'' he said interest in the character stems largely
from ``simplicity of design.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's an understatement. Hello Kitty is designed so
simply, she doesn't even have a mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley also pointed out that, unlike Disney characters, Hello
Kitty has no background in show business. ``She was designed first
and foremost for product,'' he said. This means that consumers can
project their own stories on the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a retail-first approach,'' Hensley said. ``We don't
start with a movie or anything like that. We start with the
character. It's not a stretch to place Hello Kitty on a backpack.
She was designed for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another secret to Kitty's success is that the product line is
deliberately intended to meet customers' changing needs as they
grow from 4 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many youngsters are introduced to Hello Kitty via toys or
school supplies. Later will come stationery and accessories. And as
they become older, Sanrio will continue rolling out the
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   There are no fewer than 30,000 licensed Hello Kitty products in
Japan, Hensley said. For adults with a burning Kitty addiction,
there is a Hello Kitty vacuum cleaner, a Hello Kitty toaster oven
and even a Hello Kitty piano.
</P>
<P>
   Sanrio introduces as many as 200 new items every month.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, succumbs to Kitty's charms. Chrystal
Simoneaux, 42, was spotted browsing for Hello Kitty bed sheets at
the Sanrio store.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, I had a friend who loved Hello Kitty,
and I thought, `What a load of garbage,''' she said. ``Now I have
two little girls, and they love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simoneaux gazed dubiously at the cute, sincere, honest, friendly
lovable little white cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't get it,'' she said.

 UNDATED: his wardrobe.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Mohammed V died of heart failure following what was
expected to be a minor operation, Hassan, who had been named prime
minister in 1960, moved quickly to establish his rule. His
constitution, which was ratified in 1962, guaranteed freedom of the
press and of religion, and created an elected legislature. But the
new Parliament, fractured by bitter rivalries, proved ineffectual.
The new king retained the power to name the prime minister, disband
the legislature and control the army.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1960s, student agitation led to a wave of rioting and
arrests. Opposition figures fled abroad or were imprisoned; some
were executed. In 1965, Mehdi Ben Barka, a prominent nationalist
and opposition leader, was kidnapped in Paris and never seen again.
The king's right-hand man, Minister of Interior Mohammed Oufkir,
was linked to the disappearance, and there were those who thought
he had killed Ben Barka. But the case was never pressed. In June of
that year, Hassan dissolved Parliament and instituted a state of
emergency, wielding absolute power until a new constitution was
adopted in 1970. The constitution restored limited parliamentary
government, but discontent simmered amid continuing poverty and
official corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On July 10, 1971, Hassan invited some 400 prominent Moroccans,
diplomats, and other guests to his seaside palace of Skhirat near
Rabat to celebrate his 42nd birthday. The festivities ended in a
burst of gunfire as more than 1,000 mutinous troops attacked the
palace, hurling grenades and spraying the grounds with small-arms
fire. Nearly 100 guests were killed, and more than 125 were
wounded. The king hid in a bathroom. When the firing died down he
re-emerged to find himself face to face with one of the rebel
commanders. Keeping eye contact, he recited the opening verse of
the Koran, and the rebel knelt and kissed his hand. Loyal troops
crushed the revolt, killing more than 150 rebels and capturing some
900 others, many of them young military cadets. A dozen
high-ranking, conservative officers were executed. Oufkir was named
minister of defense.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than 12 months later, on Aug. 16, 1972, the king
was returning from Paris aboard his private Boeing 727 when it
encountered an unscheduled escort of four Royal Moroccan Air Force
F-5 fighters. As the Boeing approached Rabat's airport, the
fighters fired on the plane, knocking out an engine and scoring
other hits. The Boeing landed safely, but the renegade pilots
continued to strafe the runway until Hassan radioed them, saying
the king had been killed. The rebels broke off the attack. Within
hours, key participants in the coup were arrested and shot.
</P>
<P>
   One of their leaders proved to be Oufkir, who apparently had
been secretly involved in the earlier attack on the palace.
According to official reports, the general committed suicide, but
his body was supposedly found with several wounds. His widow and
six children were placed under house arrest and were not released
until February 1991, in an amnesty marking the king's 30 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1970s unfolded, the king took several steps to dampen
domestic turmoil. In 1973, he put through measures to increase
Moroccan ownership and employment in companies doing business in
Morocco and also redistributed farmland owned by foreigners to
rural peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He alternated very cleverly between the kinds of reforms that
would be popular with the people and the kinds of reforms popular
with the ruling elite and in doing so was popular with both,'' said
Pelletreau.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1975, in a move that would unite Moroccans against a
common foe, Hassan reasserted his country's authority over the
Western Sahara, a region claimed by both Morocco and Mauritania but
was still officially under Spanish administration, by trucking some
350,000 civilians under army escort to the region, where they
staged a march.
</P>
<P>
   The move helped secure Morocco's claim but ignited a war with
guerrillas of the Polisario Front who had been fighting for
independence from Spain. Libya and Algeria supported the guerrillas
in their war against the Moroccan Army. In 1984, the king signed an
accord with Col. Moammar Kadhafi that ended Libyan backing for the
insurgents. Algeria, plagued by its own domestic problems, could
give them only minimal support. Militarily, Morocco eventually
triumphed, agreeing to a cease-fire with Polisario in 1991 that
left the country in control of most the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Polisario Front continues to hang on, but the United Nations
is scheduling a referendum in March to determine the course of the
future of the region's 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan was adept at managing Arab-Israeli relations and liked to
say that he viewed Morocco's Jewish population, which numbers
around 8,000, as a bridge between Israelis and Arabs. During World
War II, his father, Mohammed V, had defied the Axis and protected
his country's Jewish population. In 1956, the year of Moroccan
independence, there were about 275,000 Jews in Morocco. Most were
allowed to emigrate to Israel, Europe and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   During the Arab-Israeli wars of 1967 and 1973, Hassan
contributed a nominal number of troops to support Egypt and Syria.
Nevertheless, he kept his channels open with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he was the host of a meeting of Arab leaders in Fez
where he pushed through agreement on a peace plan that called for
the creation of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital
but implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist. Although it was
rejected by Israel, the plan laid the groundwork for the king to
meet with Prime Minister Shimon Peres in 1986. When he was
criticized by Arab leaders for meeting Peres, he assailed them for
having neither the ability to make war on Israel nor the
willingness to make peace.

 UNDATED: make peace.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In September 1993, Morocco gave de facto recognition to Israel
by welcoming Yitzhak Rabin in the first official visit by an
Israeli prime minister to an Arab nation other than Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such bold gestures, he was careful to play both sides of
a conflict when necessary. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990, he sent 1,300 troops to Saudi Arabia, a gesture that pleased
the West. But he also expressed sympathy for Iraqis suffering under
U.N. sanctions and ordered members of the Moroccan royal family to
supervise the collection of supplies to ease their plight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite aid from the West, sporadic reform efforts, and an
estimated $2 billion a year sent home by Moroccans working abroad,
the economic situation during the 1990s remained difficult for most
of Morocco's 25 million people, two-thirds of whom are under the
age of 25. In the census of 1994, the urban population exceeded the
rural population for the first time. Unrest generally declined in
the cities, where most of the economic reforms were concentrated.
Although unemployment remained a problem and the strains of a
relatively slow pace of development continued, political freedom
gradually increased. In the early 1990s, pressure from human rights
groups reduced the number of political prisoners and reports of
incidents of torture declined.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist parties did well in the most recent election, in
1993. Another election is scheduled in November, in which the lower
house of Parliament will be directly elected for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such moves toward democracy, throughout his reign the
king remained jealous of preserving the symbols of his monarchy. He
refused, for example, to abandon the practice of having his
subjects show their fealty by kissing his hand, even though
advisers urged him to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he donned a business suit to meet with Western leaders,
or appeared in traditional white robes to preside over religious
ceremonies, the King was a leader of commanding presence, an
eloquent orator in Arabic who spoke excellent French and capable
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``His golf outings were the picture of an oriental potentate,''
recalled Pelletreau, the U.S. diplomat. ``He would be accompanied
by a vast entourage. If he wanted to sit, chairs would appear, and
his guests would be offered sherbert.''
</P>
<P>
   Through intelligence, charm and cunning, he steered an absolute
monarchy into the modern world. ``He sheltered Morocco from the
various political winds that blew across the Arab world and caused
such turmoil in other countries.'' Pelletreau said.
</P>
<P>
   The king is survived by his wife, Lalla Latifa, a commoner who
is officially described as the mother of the royal children, three
daughters and two sons, including the crown prince, Sidi Mohammed,
who is to succeed him as to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, the crown prince comes to the throne with the
reputation of a playboy. At 35, he is still single in a society the
emphasizes family ties. He was educated in France, where he
received a degree in law and studied international relations. He
speaks fluent French, Spanish and English as well as Arabic. In
recent years, he has begun to take a more active public role as
second in command of the Moroccan military and in helping to direct
government aid to the poor. Hassan sent the crown prince as his
representative to the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan in
February. With his accession to the throne, his younger brother
Mulai Rashid will become the new crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   Palace officials say the transition will bring no change in key
Moroccan policies, including the longstanding alliance with the
United States and strong support for peace between Israel and its
Arab neighbors. The aides also said Sidi Mohammed
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  would continue his father's policy of
insisting on Moroccan sovereignty over the disputed territory of
the Western Sahara, which Morocco oc- cupied in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the crown prince is expected to take his distance
from some of his father's closest advisers, principally Interior
Minister Driss Basri, who in his 20 years in that post has been
associated with hard-line policies toward domestic opposition from
both the left and the Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Hassan said recently that Sidi Mohammed was likely to
move hard-liners in his father's en- tourage aside in effort to
accelerate democratic reforms that his father had initiated in
recent years.

 WATERHOUSE WORKERS TO BE PAID FOR MISSED BREAKS  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ Once again, we have proof that there is no such
thing as a free lunch.
<P>
   Just ask Waterhouse Securities, the nationwide discount broker,
which has agreed to pay $3.3 million to 1,770 account officers,
customer representatives and managers who were allegedly required
to work through their lunch periods without breaks or compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Across America, employees of countless companies at least
occasionally work through their lunch hours without demanding
compensation. But even when this is done voluntarily, it
technically violates state and federal laws, said Miles Locker,
chief counsel to the California labor commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterhouse settlement stemmed from a class-action lawsuit
filed by five current or former Bay Area employees in October in
San Francisco federal court. It was approved Friday by Judge
Charles A. Legge.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rubin, a lawyer with the Altshuler, Berzon firm in San
Francisco, who represented the plaintiffs, said Waterhouse gave its
employees free meals or small meal allowances to cover what should
have been half-hour lunch breaks but required them to remain on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contended that under state and federal law they
should have been allowed to leave the premises for a half-hour each
day. Barring that, they said, they should have been paid for their
time, including overtime if they worked more than 40 hours in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waterhouse felt that the fact they were giving free
sandwiches, drinks and chips was a good, beneficent employment
practice,'' Rubin remarked. ``It may not have realized it had a
legal problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the settlement, Waterhouse refused to acknowledge
that the employee claims had legal merit.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Waterhouse headquarters in New York could not be
reached for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the settlement was divided into two sections,
applying to Californians and non-Californians, because of
differences in state and federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The 170 Californians covered by the settlement will get up to
$7,000 each, depending on how long they worked for Waterhouse. The
non-Californians will get up to $3,750.
</P>
<P>
   Locker said Friday that the state law is unequivocal.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in California are entitled to ``an off-duty meal
period'' of at least a half-hour, he observed. ``If you get it, you
don't have to be paid for it. If you don't get it, you have to be
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   In the negotiations, however, Waterhouse pointed to two possible
defenses, Rubin said. It noted that brokers are required to sign an
agreement that disputes with their employer will be settled by
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs countered with the argument that forced
arbitration of overtime claims violated federal law. They also said
the New York Stock Exchange, which created the forced-arbitration
format, made an exception in the case of class-action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Waterhouse also pointed to federal laws and regulations that
seemingly exempt brokers from overtime rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin countered that the overtime exemption, which dates back
many years, applies only to brokers with full-service firms who
have special relationships with customers. He said they don't apply
to employees of discount brokerages who merely ``take orders and
don't give specialized advice.''

DONNA ALLEN, FEMINIST AND POLITICAL ACTIVIST, DIES AT 79  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Calif., Washington, D.C., Tenn., Ill., N.C.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donna Allen, an early standard bearer of feminism who kept an
eye on the news media and communications industry from her home in
Washington, died on Monday of a heart attack. She was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Her family said she died at a hospital, but declined to name it
or its location.
</P>
<P>
   Allen came to social and political activism as a young woman,
when she was organizing farm workers on the West Coast and writing
pamphlets for the American Federation of Labor in Washington. In
the early 1950s, as a student and teacher, she became involved with
the League of Women Voters, which was scrutinizing the loyalty
program that President Harry S. Truman initiated in 1947, requiring
security checks on government employees.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rising fear of Communism and subversion at the time.
She strongly objected to loyalty oaths and their general acceptance
by the news media. From this she developed her lifelong interest in
the communications industry and the role that women played in it.
</P>
<P>
   She was a founder of Women Strike for Peace, which opposed
nuclear weapons and the war in Indochina, and served as the
Washington representative of the National Committee to Abolish the
House Un-American Activities Committee, hoping to end the
committee's relentless inquiries into alleged Communist
infiltration of colleges and universities, labor unions, businesses
and professional organizations.
</P>
<P>
   She herself ran afoul of the committee in 1965, when it
questioned the visa granted to a Japanese pacifist and law school
dean for an American lecture tour in 1963. She and two others
refused to testify at a closed hearing, claiming a constitutional
right to an open hearing so that they could clear their names in
public.
</P>
<P>
   The committee cited the trio for contempt of Congress. A U.S.
District Court judge found them guilty, gave them suspended
sentences of four months in prison and fined them $100 each. The
sentences and fines were overturned on appeal, a common outcome of
the committee's zeal in those years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Allen founded the Women's Institute for Freedom of the
Press and started a periodic newsletter called the Media Report to
Women: What Women Are Doing and Thinking About the Communications
Media.
</P>
<P>
   She edited Media Report, now a quarterly, until selling it in
1987 to another publisher, but continued as president of the
institute until her death, organizing conferences and writing to
express the women's point of view in this country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Petoskey, Mich., and received a bachelor's
degree from Duke University in 1943. She received a master's degree
in economics from the University of Chicago in 1953 and a doctorate
in history from Howard University in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   She taught grievance procedures, labor economics and history at
the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University
in the early 1950s, and assisted Sen. Paul H. Douglas, an Illinois
Democrat who also was an economist, with an update of his classic
text, ``Theory of Wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen was the author of ``Fringe Benefits'' (1964) and co-author
of ``Communications at the Crossroads: The Gender Gap Connection''
(1988). She was active in the National Women's Political Caucus,
the National Organization for Women and the National Women's Party.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to Russel Allen, a resident of Nashville, ended in
divorce. She is survived by three daughters, Dana Densmore of Santa
Fe, N.M., Indra Allen of San Francisco and Dr. Martha Allen of
Washington; a son, Mark, of Memphis; a brother, Donald Rehkopf of
Chicago, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the organization demanding the abolition of the
House Committee on Un-American Activities, Allen attended a public
hearing in which the committee delved into the ``invisible empire''
of the Ku Klux Klan in 1965. As the investigators tried to sort out
such mysterious entities as klaliffs, klokards and kludds, Allen
was seen sporting a button proclaiming: ``I am not now nor have I
ever been a member of HUAC.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee stopped asking that of suspected Communist Party
members in 1969, when the House abolished it. Allen's group
henceforth called itself the Committee Against Repressive
Legislation, of which she became vice chairman in 1975.

NOT YOUR FATHER'S FESTIVAL: HIP-HOP AND HIGH-TECH
</HEADLINE>
   (Also filed in `a' category; with WOODSTOCK-NYT) 
(rk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ How many of you don't care? hardcore rapper DMX,
using less genteel language, asked the crowd as the sun dropped in
the sky on the first day of Woodstock '99. Scores of thousands in
the almost entirely white audience responded enthusiastically that
they indeed did not care.
</P>
<P>
   Then DMX, one of the most popular rappers today, bounded into a
set of songs written for a black audience, pausing as audience
members shouted back the call-and-response lyrics. Accompanied only
by a disc jockey, DMX went on to rap choruses about drive-by
shootings, lyrics inspired by Satanic mythology and songs asking
the audience if members were killers.
</P>
<P>
   This was not your baby boomer's Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which continues on Saturday and Sunday, is now in
its third incarnation: there was the psychedelic hippie
free-for-all of 1969; the tattooed, pierced alternative rock update
in '94; and this year's installment, which could best be described
as the revenge of hip-hop, or the rise of the white b-boy.
</P>
<P>
   Performing Friday for a crowd of mostly teen-agers sprinkled
with a few hippie leftovers were white acts like Korn, Insane Clown
Posse, and G. Love and Special Sauce, which borrow heavily from
hip-hop; and established black rap acts, including DMX and the
Roots. Even the oldies acts were booked less with Woodstock '69 in
mind and more with an eye toward hip-hop prehistory. They included
the funk showmen James Brown and George Clinton, two of the genre's
biggest influences.
</P>
<P>
   For those walking around the concession stands, Woodstock '99
felt similar to a day on a New Jersey shore boardwalk while the
music was similar to the many rock radio station festivals that
gather the top bands of the moment for shortened sets. In other
words, there were a lot of bands, there were a lot of people, and
there was a lot of heatstroke at Woodstock '99.
</P>
<P>
   But the scale was larger than most recent rock festivals and,
most importantly, the name Woodstock added a veneer of excitement,
authenticity and meaning to the proceedings. It helped create the
feeling that if the crowd isn't creating history, it is at least
making some kind of connection with an event that did.
</P>
<P>
   If Woodstock was a generation reacting against the images of
violence and strife (in Vietnam and at home) they were blitzed with
in the media, then this is a generation trying to replicate what
they've seen in the media, particularly TV and movies. At the
festival in 1994, kids rolled in the mud, thinking they were acting
in the spirit of the original Woodstock film, and singled
themselves out for attention by calling themselves ``mud people.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, so far, there has been no rain: as a result, the few
mud people wandering around on Friday lived their Woodstock fantasy
by rolling around in the cesspool near the portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the rest, the connection was made by young fans
pulling aside grizzled, tie-dyed hippies to take photos with them.
Wavy Gravy, the 1969 Woodstock master of ceremonies, wandered
around with a plastic fish on a leash and a flowing tie-dyed
outfit, surrounded by an enthralled rabble of audience members and
television news crews.
</P>
<P>
   Like the audience, the bands were eager to replicate the
Woodstock they had seen on film. The comedy group the Umbilical
Brothers made jokes about bad acid, even though _ backstage, at
least _ a reporter saw crack being smoked but no acid being taken.
</P>
<P>
   James Brown, after performing an incomprehensible version of
``It's a Man's, Man's, Man's, World,'' urged the crowd to take 30
seconds of silence for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and
sister-in-law, and then asked for a round of applause for the
Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   The English modern soul band Jamiroquai tried in its own way to
make a link with the nudity of Woodstock, leading the crowd in a
chant of ``breasts.''
</P>
<P>
   If walking around naked was an expression of an alternative
community free of society's rules at Woodstock '69, here nude and
topless women were to be ogled at like at a Spring Break event. And
performers were not immune: as the guitarist and singer Sheryl Crow
sang, ``Makes You Happy,'' audience members urged her to lift her
shirt, causing her some consternation on stage. When the crowd
members asked the same of actress Rosie Perez when she was
introducing DMX, she told them to rent ``Do the Right Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Day One of Woodstock pointed to another trait of modern culture:
the dominance of the screen (be it television, computer or movie)
over real life. Throughout the concert, planes soared overhead,
announcements were made from stage, and giant video screens flashed
the news: the video and CD of Woodstock '99 would be in stores this
September. Then, the audience could experience the concert the
right way _ on their television screens _ and shout, like the
Woodstock '69 attendees who returned this year, the generational
rallying cry of belonging: ``I was there!''

 &HT;    Is Champ Bailey the $13 million man?
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Washington Redskins' top draft choice may be in
training camp on time after all. Former Georgia All-America
cornerback Champ Bailey, the seventh pick in April's NFL draft, is
expected to sign a five-year contract with the Redskins today in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, including incentives, could be worth nearly $13
million for Bailey, a 6-foot-1, 184-pound native of Folkston, who
will receive a signing bonus of $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get in camp right away so I can make an early
impact,'' Bailey said. ``I just wanted to make sure everybody was
happy with the terms of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want any strange relationships about money going into
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's base package over five years will net him approximately
the same amount as the draft's sixth selection, N.C. State wide
receiver Torry Holt, who signed a five-year, $10 million contract
with the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman Trophy-winning tailback Ricky Williams of Texas, who was
picked fifth by the New Orleans Saints, signed a seven-year, $68
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   However, Williams could earn the league's minimum salary for the
length of the deal if he doesn't reach lofty incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circumstances under which the deal had to be negotiated
were difficult because the two deals in front of us had been
completed for some time and we didn't agree with them,'' said
Bailey's agent, Jack Reale of Atlanta. ``It also was difficult
because this particular pick in the draft, No. 7, hadn't received
any incentives for at least five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract for Bailey, the nation's top two-way threat as a
junior at Georgia last season, is incentive laden. The agreement
was reached only two days before the Redskins' rookies are
scheduled to report to camp in Frostburg, Md.

 &HT;    Elliott, sponsor differ on retirement plans
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ While McDonald's seems poised to promote next
season as Bill Elliott's last go-around on NASCAR's Winston Cup
circuit, he denied speculation Friday that he'll retire after the
2000 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, the 1988 Winston Cup champion and Dawsonville native
who is one of the few remaining owner-drivers left in the series,
says he's pursuing a sponsor that would replace McDonald's after
2000, when his three-year contract with the fast-food giant
expires.
</P>
<P>
   But a document obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
indicates that Elliott, voted the sport's most popular driver by
fans a record 13 times, was at least considering retirement after
next season.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent via e-mail on March 6 to Bill Korbus,
McDonald's motorsports manager, Elliott's wife outlined her ideas
of possible marketing strategies for ``Bill's 25th
anniversary/retirement celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Elliott has no desire to commemorate every race track's
last race throughout his final season. Moreover, Bill would prefer
to connect with the special events that make his career one of the
most celebrated of NASCAR's history,'' wrote Cindy Elliott, chief
operating officer of Bill Elliott Racing.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing possible memorabilia for her husband's final
season of driving, Cindy Elliott wrote, ``It is not our desire to
saturate the market with useless pieces of diecast that represent
no historic value relative to Bill's career other than a final race
at each track. We feel more comfortable with a pin collection to
commemorate the final season and one for the 25th anniversary
celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday at Pocono Raceway, Elliott, 43, said he
plans on driving at least through the 2001 season. But it seems
clear that his relationship with his primary sponsor has soured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking hard for sponsors for the 2001 season and
beyond,'' Elliott said. ``I told (McDonald's) at the beginning of
the year that I was going to continue driving. Whatever
(documentation McDonald's) has is irrelevant.... I think it's been
a very unfair situation for me because it's been sold as (me
retiring) to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's, which has been the primary sponsor of Elliott's No.
94 Ford for five years, said May 1 that it also will support a
Busch Grand National team next season. That car, fielded by
California-based Precision Preparation Inc., is expected to jump to
Winston Cup racing in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's has been criticized for its handling of the
announcement, which was made at California Speedway and apparently
surprised Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea it was coming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Korbus claims he didn't approach PPI owner Cal Wells until
he received documentation that Elliott was retiring after next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did Bill's contract in 1997, it was structured so that
it would see Bill through his retirement,'' Korbus said. ``They
don't want Bill to be fussed over at every race (next year). He may
do like Michael Jordan and John Elway. When he gets out of the car
for the last time, he may just say, `That's it.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Elliott, who has 40 Winston Cup victories, does retire next
year, he'd join veteran driver Darrell Waltrip, who's expected to
make it official next month in Indianapolis that the 2000 season
will be his farewell tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody asks when Darrell is going to retire,'' Elliott
said. ``Darrell worked hard to get to this point. Regardless of his
performance on the race track, I think he has just as much right to
be here as anybody else. That's the way I see it. Let that decision
be up to Darrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I feel like I'm not contributing to the team, then I need
to get out of the race car _ the way Bill Elliott wants to.

 &HT;    Gordon, Jarrett OK; Gordon, Wallace not
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ Jeff Gordon has made up with Winston Cup points
leader Dale Jarrett, but his situation with Rusty Wallace is a
different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon angered his two fellow NASCAR drivers during separate
incidents at Loudon, N.H., on July 11. The stock-car series was off
last weekend, but the war of words returned to the track Friday as
quickly as the race teams did.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Gordon bumped into each other during Lap 144 at
Loudon. The result of the contact was Wallace's No. 2 Ford spinning
out of control and into the wall. It was the third time in as many
years that the the rivals have had a controversial contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gotten an apology (for Loudon),'' Wallace said after
first-round qualifying at Pocono Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Gordon's perspective on the run-in on Friday, an ``I'm
sorry'' may never be coming toward Wallace's garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went down into three and (Wallace) just came right down on
me,'' Gordon said. ``I didn't want to hit him because it tore my
car up some also, but there wasn't much I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bad blood between the drivers, Wallace promises no
revenge _ at least publicly _ as the circuit resumes with Sunday's
Pennsylvania 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happened at Pocono and he got hurt it would be my
fault,'' Wallace said. ``That used to happen in the old days of
Winston Cup, but not now.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Jarrett and Gordon appear to be
driver-friendly. Gordon bumped into Jarrett in the final lap on the
way to finishing third. They had a nasty postrace exchange, but
Gordon later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know what happened at Loudon,'' Jarrett said
Friday. ``That's past and gone; we're at Pocono right now ready to
go race anybody that's up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas two step
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR has not released its 2000 schedule, but Texas Motor
Speedway owner Bruton Smith feels confident a second race in the
Lonestar State will be added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas Motor Speedway is an incredible place,'' Smith told the
Dallas Morning News. ``We've got a quarter of a billion dollars
invested there. It's a great market. Talk to all of your drivers.
They sell more souvenirs at Texas than any place they go.''
</P>
<P>
   The parties involved in making out the schedule are NASCAR
president Bill France and new chief operating officer Mike Helton.
Each has stated in the past that when the series expands,
favoritism will go to new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Damage report
</P>
<P>
   Both Jerry Nadeau, driver for the No. 9 Ford, and Kyle Petty got
to meet Pocono's wall during Friday's qualifying. Each crashed into
the fence, with Nadeau suffering the worst damage. He was taken to
the Infield Care Center, examined then released.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good hit,'' Nadeau said. ``It knocked my glasses off
and broke the steering arm and head rest.

KENNEDY COVERAGE: COMMUNAL MIND CONTROL AND ILLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also moved in `a' category; with KENNEDY-RDP) 
(lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   That sickening thud in the stomach so many people felt on
hearing that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was missing had nothing to
do with a family curse or his role in history. Hearing this news
was more like learning that Princess Diana had died or that a brick
had fallen off a building and killed a passerby. Here was someone
who, in a flash, had literally vanished from the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   And though Kennedy's death offered one more reminder that no
amount of money or fame can protect you, paradoxically the stunned
response was intensified by our attachment to celebrity. Kennedy
was part of a constellation of the famous whom the media have made
familiar; when one of those stars falls out of place, something
seems off kilter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It took television no time at all to ignore such human responses
and substitute bogus ones. During a week of relentless coverage,
which seemed all the more inescapable because it dominated the
networks as well as the 24-hour news channels, television became
increasingly detached from reality. Attempting to find significance
in a life that was still being formed, television commentators
imposed a historical shape on it. With this death, television has
not served the useful function of communal mourning so much as it
has provided communal mind control and illusion.
</P>
<P>
   What began last Saturday with wall-to-wall network coverage of
the search for the missing plane (non-news labeled ``breaking
news'' for days) reached almost absurd depths Friday with live
coverage of an event that could not be covered. Dan Rather, Tom
Brokaw and Peter Jennings were all on the air for the memorial Mass
from which cameras and microphones were banned. The anchors did the
equivalent of the red-carpet arrivals, identifying the guests.
</P>
<P>
   The commentators continued a process that had begun with word of
the missing plane: Kennedy (and by extension his dutifully
mentioned wife and sister-in-law) were canvases on which reporters,
historians and long-lost college classmates imposed what they
wanted to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The most incessantly asked question about Kennedy was also the
most irrelevant and unanswerable: Would he have gone into politics
had he lived? An astonishing number of people convinced themselves,
on evidence usually no better than wishful thinking, that he would
have.
</P>
<P>
   And every channel instantly trotted out childhood pictures,
dominated by the image of Kennedy as a 3-year-old saluting his
father's coffin. It is an undeniably heart-wrenching image, but at
times was put to tacky use. During MSNBC's coverage of Friday's
memorial, it accompanied the logo ``A Final Salute.''
</P>
<P>
   The image soon became a generational litmus test. Those who
remembered having seen that salute 35 years ago histrionically
viewed Kennedy as the heir to Camelot. More realistically, those of
Kennedy's own generation saw him as a decent man who died
frighteningly young. But because commentators who remembered the
image far outnumbered those who did not (youth may dominate
television entertainment, but not news) the image became a pat
explanation for the outpouring of grief, the we-remember-John-John
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   This coverage was about celebrity, not politics or history. And
though fame has its social meaning (Kennedy's celebrity-political
magazine, George, is prime evidence), that is not the issue
television explored. Instead, reporters became defensive and
disingenuous about their voyeuristic roles. On CNN, Larry King
prodded Gary Tuchman, the reporter staking out the home of
Kennedy's sister, Caroline, to say he was waiting just in case she
wanted to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   None of this denies the tragedy of these three deaths or the
genuine emotional tug that accompanies them. It does suggest a
media that generates significance rather than discerns it. There
were a few hints that some people realized that. Peter Jennings was
at times a voice of sanity Friday. During ABC's coverage of the
memorial, he referred to the weight of meaning the media had been
attaching to Kennedy all week and asked the most realistic but
least heeded question of all: ``I wonder if we're not imposing a
burden on him in death that he would not have appreciated in
life.''

 &HT;    Skinner captures pole and keeps a crew chief
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ NASCAR driver Mike Skinner was a double-winner
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling operator of the No. 31 Chevy, he just missed
setting a qualifying record at Pocono Speedway while winning the
pole position for Sunday's Pennsylvania 500.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Skinner's crew chief, Larry McReynolds,
disqualified himself from being a Winston Cup car owner in 2000,
signing a three-year contract to remain with Richard Childress
Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Did the first event affect the outcome of the second one?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Skinner said emphatically. ``Larry has been
awful good at staying focused on the 31 car. Making that
announcement (Friday) morning probably put a lot of confidence back
into this race team.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving a new Chevy that had been used only twice in practice
this year, Skinner lapped the 2.5-mile tri-oval in 52.801 seconds,
an average speed of 170.451 mph. The qualifying record is 170.506
mph, established by Sterling Marlin last month.
</P>
<P>
   For Skinner, it was the third pole position of his career, but
the first in 64 races. His most-recent pole was at Daytona
International Speedway in July 1997. Skinner will be joined on the
front row Sunday by Mark Martin in the No. 6 Ford, who qualified at
170.078 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schrader will start third, followed by Bobby Labonte and
John Andretti. Wally Dallenbach starts sixth and defending race
winner Jeff Gordon was seventh-fastest.
</P>
<P>
   The return of McReynolds as crew chief pleased Skinner so much
that he could barely keep a smile off his face all day. McReynolds
had been trying for months to develop a team, but the idea crashed
when sponsorship plans faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to finally get something done and settled about this
whole mess and put everything to rest,'' McReynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said, ``I'm pretty pumped up ... Now, maybe, in the next
year or so, we can go out and win (Childress) a few races and maybe
even a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   With McReynolds in charge, Skinner has eight top-10 finishes in
18 starts. The team was in the fast lane at the start of the
season, topping the points standings three times through the first
four races.
</P>
<P>
   But Skinner descended after back-to-back finishes of 32nd and
42nd at Darlington and Texas in March. The team enters this weekend
at No. 11 in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``(With the possibility of McReynolds leaving), I think I might
have lost a bit of confidence,'' Skinner said. ``I don't realize
how or when or where, but it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds and partner John Dangler of Indianapolis worked
extensively over the past 11 months to start a team. The final blow
came with the pullout of Tide, which had previously expressed
interest after revealing it's leaving driver Ricky Rudd after this
season.

K-SWISS STOCK DROPS 17 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wall Street delivered a kick in the shins to
K-Swiss Inc. as the athletic-shoe maker's stock lost 17 percent of
its value Friday following a record-setting yet disappointing
earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss fell $7.75 to $38.25 on heavy volume with just over 2
million shares changing hands. During the previous session, trading
had totaled 152,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   The decline came despite a report, issued after the markets
closed Thursday, showing second-quarter profits had tripled to
$6.74 million, or 58 cents a share. That was 12 cents ahead of
First Call Corp.'s published estimate of two analysts, but
represented a major setback in the eyes of investors who had been
hoping for much better results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company did nothing wrong during the quarter, so the
expectations had gotten a little too high,'' explained Jeff van
Sinderen, an analyst with B. Riley who carries a ``neutral'' rating
on the stock. ``People had been expecting a great quarter because
the company blew away the forecasts in the first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In that April 22 report, K-Swiss posted earnings of $13.3
million, or $1.15 a share, topping Wall Street's expectations by 40
cents and boosting shares by 13 percent to $42.125, or more than
triple its price at the end of 1998. Shares hit an all-time high of
$57.375 on May28, slid back under $40 by mid-June and topped $50
again in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss, which posted a 64 percent gain in quarterly revenues to
$67.2 million, said the improved results stemmed from new marketing
strategies and diversification of offerings. ``The company did very
well with a lot of one-time, one-season shoes,'' van Sinderen said.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst said his brokerage remains neutral on the stock
because its price has risen so quickly. ``We're going to wait and
see,'' he added. ``We first became involved at a much lower
price.''

thing is call up Uncle Teddy and gloat.' I loved that. It was so
like his father.''

CITING THREATS, FBI SUSPENDS PUBLIC TOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI announced Friday an indefinite suspension
of the popular tours of its headquarters after receiving what it
termed ``unconfirmed threats.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement put out by the FBI said that the suspension would
allow it ``to complete security enhancements'' being made because
of the threats and that the tours would resume, though the
statement did not predict when.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau declined to describe the threats, although NBC News
reported that they concerned possible terrorist attacks by
followers of Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Islamic radical accused
of plotting the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania that killed more than 220 people last August.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman, Tron Brekke, told journalists Friday that the
threat was discovered through intelligence, rather than being
conveyed directly to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take it seriously,'' Brekke said.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's statement said, ``The FBI is aware of the
inconvenience that the cancellation of the tours will pose for
those who wish to visit FBI headquarters,'' but it added that the
safety of visitors was the main reason for halting the one-hour
tours.
</P>
<P>
   Security concerns have caused tours to be suspended during World
War II, antiwar protests in the early 1970s, riots in 1968 and the
Persian Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau began giving tours in 1937, when it was in the main
building of the Justice Department on Pennsylvania Avenue. Since
1975, the agency's headquarters have been in the J. Edgar Hoover
FBI Building across the street from the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The abruptness of the decision announced Friday was reflected by
the continued presence Friday evening of an advertisement for the
tour on the FBI Web site. The bureau says almost 500,000 people
take the guided tour each year.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Berry, a special agent in the FBI's press office, said
that the last tour went through at midafternoon. Friday was not a
particularly busy day, Berry said, and relatively few people were
inconvenienced by the suspension. The tours are conducted Monday
through Friday, except on holidays, from 8:45 a.m. to 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The tour includes information on the bureau's organization, a
review of some of its most famous cases, a look at the ``Ten Most
Wanted List,'' a walk through its laboratory and a firearms
demonstration _ accompanied by a safety message for children.

SPORTS COLUMN: `SAFE' TRADE MIGHT PROVE ANYTHING BUT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets returned to Shea Stadium Friday
night as conquering heroes. They had played eight games on the road
and won all but two, and barreled home just two games behind an
Atlanta Braves team that was beginning to look rather ordinary.
These Mets suddenly are strong, surging and confident.
</P>
<P>
   So going into the last two weeks of July, the only thing left to
do was fill a glaring hole in the starting pitching rotation by way
of a trade, and trade talk had been rampant. Sure enough, Friday
morning the Mets said that they would announce a major trade in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa was in town, and over in the Bronx the New York
Yankees were opening a crucial series with Cleveland at Yankee
Stadium, but now the Mets had a major trade that could push them
over the top. There were rumors that the trade could involve a
certain pitcher who had already played for one New York team. That
could be just one person: David Wells. Boomer!
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Before Friday night's game, reporters were introduced
_ again _ to Rogers. Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a major trade but rather an intriguing trade
involving a pitcher who had reached the pinnacle _ a perfect game
in 1994 with Texas _ and sunk to the depths in two Yankee seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Friday he reminded us that the wounds inflicted had not healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' he said. ``I look forward to this
challenge. It affords me a chance to go back to New York and pitch
well. I have something to prove to myself more than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the letdown after a grand buildup. More than that, the
trade, although apparently safe _ acquiring a veteran for a pair of
minor league players _ is a potentially dangerous one for the Mets.
The Mets need pitching, true, but more than that they need a spark
and a fire to sustain the team in the long run. There is something
fragile about the Mets, who had the playoffs in their grasp last
season and cracked at the very end. There is a fragile quality
about Rogers, too.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked whether he was completely healthy, Rogers
said: ``Physically. Mentally, I'm probably never completely
healthy, but that's pretty much the story for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good now,'' he added. ``I think the way I'm
pitching I can pitch anywhere. That's the key for me, that I get
the ball every fifth day, or whatever, and the results will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that Rogers won't get the ball every fifth day. In an
attempt to avoid fouling up the Mets' rotation, manager Bobby
Valentine is going to a six-man rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Can Rogers perform in New York? The Mets are in a playoff race.
Expectations are high, pressure is mounting on the manager and
general manager. Asked whether there was more pressure being a $20
million free agent with the Yankees or being traded to the Mets and
trying to help them to the post-season, Rogers began by saying the
right thing, then admitted the truth: ``I think about the job I'm
supposed to do and I never look at what I'm making, that I have to
do more than I'm capable of. Did I do that in New York? Maybe a
little bit, but I think that's a lesson learned. Hopefully. It's
the same town. I think I can handle whatever comes my way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are still in Rogers' blood. ``I thought a few times
about, if I was a free agent, maybe trying to come back and play
with the Yankees,'' he said. ``Call George up, drop him a line. I
have things that I'd like to do, too. I wasn't happy with what
happened with the first situation with the Yankees. Now I welcome
the challenge to go out there. Maybe being with the Mets, it'll be
even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had his chances with the Yankees and couldn't seize the
opportunity. He wound up his second season being demoted to the
bullpen. Now he is reunited with Valentine. Rogers credits
Valentine with bringing him to the big leagues in 1989 when
Valentine, then the Texas manager, gave Rogers an opportunity in
spring training. ``For whatever reason, he took me over a couple of
other guys,'' Rogers said. ``He really helped me get through the
first year, and I just built on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Valentine: ``It was easy to see what Kenny had as a
pitcher, great athletic ability. He wasn't afraid of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he is taking on New York for a second time. What does he
have, what does he have left, to give the Mets in a do-or-die
season?
</P>
<P>
   Rogers should like his new surroundings, but he should be
forewarned: the neighborhood may be nice, but the city is mean as
ever.

 &HT;    Cepeda's redemption
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The phone call came at 10:45 a.m., Pacific Standard
Time. It was Tuesday, March 2, and Orlando Cepeda was already on
the phone, speaking with a friend in his native Puerto Rico who had
called to ``wish me luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Cepeda has call waiting. Call waiting is critical
when the one call you've waited 20 years for finally arrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Outta here,''' recalled Cepeda, who abruptly ended the
well-wisher's phone call. The next voice he heard was Ed Stack,
calling from Cooperstown, N.Y. ``Congratulations,'' said the
president of the Baseball Hall of Fame. ``You've been selected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's it,'' Cepeda said. ``I didn't know what else he
said. I was in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   In tears, too. ``Tears of happiness,'' Cepeda said. A
quarter-century after retiring from baseball, two decades since he
first became eligible for the Hall of Fame, Orlando Cepeda _ one of
the game's greatest hitters in the past 40 years and later a lost,
wayward soul who did prison time for a drug conviction _ was
finally bound for Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that it was the 12-member Veterans Committee of the
Hall _ not the regular electorate, the Baseball Writers Association
of America _ that had convened in Tampa and voted him in. Once the
``Baby Bull'' as a San Francisco Giants rookie in 1958 and the NL
Rookie of the Year that season, later a unanimous MVP on the 1967
world champion Cardinals (.325, 25 homers, 111 RBIs and then
``Cha-Cha'' as the slugging first baseman of the Braves' 1969 NL
West champs, Cepeda is at last among the game's certified elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it means more,'' Cepeda said of his selection by the
Veterans Committee, which includes Hall of Famers Ted Williams,
Stan Musial and Yogi Berra. ``It would be wonderful to go (in) with
the writers. But they (the Veterans Committee) know. Like Felipe
Alou says, they know who should be in there. It's like Tony Perez,
(Tony) Oliva, (Luis) Tiant, they should be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Cepeda reached with his left hand for another
baseball. He was here this week for the National Sports Collectors
Convention at the Georgia World Congress Center. On Thursday and
Friday, Cepeda signed balls for $30 a pop, this time with a new
signature:
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Cepeda
</P>
<P>
   H of F '99
</P>
<P>
   That's Hall of Fame 1999. ``Funny. They wanted me to do that
before but I didn't want to,'' said Cepeda, who flew to New York on
Friday. He will be honored at a party tonight and inducted into the
Hall on Sunday. ``I didn't want to jinx anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Cepeda was surprised by his selection in March. Merely
overwhelmed. The night before, he'd slept well. ``But I wasn't too
sure,'' he said. ``I didn't want to be pessimistic but I didn't
want to be optimistic. I wanted to be in-between. It happened
before.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring following the 1974 season, Cepeda waited the
mandatory five-year waiting period before becoming eligible for the
Hall. Once his name appeared on the ballot, the next 15 years
became a frustrating, often maddening test of endurance. The worst
year was 1994, when only one player _ Steve Carlton _ was chosen
for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' he said. ``We had so many hopes. But we
realized there's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda could only ponder his exclusion. ``If I was Puerto
Rican?'' he said. ``If I was black? If I was in trouble? I had to
make sure I didn't say anything that would hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, Cepeda had already damaged his life _ much less a
chance for immortality _ almost irreparably. On Dec. 12, 1975, he
was arrested at the airport in San Juan after receiving two
packages sent to him from Colombia. According to federal agents,
the packages contained 170 pounds of marijuana, hidden among rugs
and dresses. Although Cepeda initially denied knowledge of the pot,
he now admits he planned to use five pounds for himself and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, 1978, Cepeda was convicted of possession of
marijuana with intent to sell. He was sentenced to five years in
prison and sent to a minimum-security federal camp at Eglin Air
Force Base in Florida, where he began by cleaning toilets and later
graduated to washing underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cepeda was paroled 10 months later, his life was in
tatters. He'd already lost several jobs, all his money, his first
wife, everything. He'd been a serial philanderer. Now he bounced
around baseball, in and out of the game, and went through several
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In '84, Cepeda moved from Puerto Rico to Los Angeles, hoping for
a new start. Eventually, his second wife left him and returned to
Puerto Rico with their two sons. Cepeda was left with his namesake,
Orlando Jr., then 19, and little else.
</P>
<P>
   Salvation came in several forms: his third wife, Mirian. Cepeda
also found peace and serenity in Buddhism, which he practices to
this day. In 1987, after moving from Los Angeles to San Francisco,
Cepeda returned to his old ballpark for the first time in years and
was overwhelmed at the unexpectedly warm reception he received from
Giants fans, players and the organization itself. In '88, he began
a series of jobs with the club, from scouting to player development
and now, in the community relations department, to engendering
goodwill wherever he goes.
</P>
<P>
   For a few days this week, Cepeda was back in Atlanta, where he
played from 1969-1972 after a spring training trade in March, 1969.
It was straight up: Cepeda for Joe Torre. Cepeda was not pleased.
``Bad,'' he said. ``They trade you in the middle of spring
training. You have to pack; you have to move somewhere else. I
said, `If they trade me to Atlanta, I quit baseball. I hate this
town. It's so hot.' But then when you come to play here, I love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda lived in a three-bedroom, $285-a-month apartment. ``I was
the first black who lived in Jonesboro,'' he said. ``It was a great
apartment. Plus, playing with Hank (Aaron), right from the
beginning, he made me feel welcome. The first day in spring
training, he told me, 'You're gonna help us this year.' And we did
it. We won the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Cepeda hit .257 in '69 with 22 homers and 88 RBIs as the Braves
won their first title of any sort in Atlanta. They were swept in
the NLCS by the Mets despite Cepeda's .455 average (5-for-11), home
run and three RBIs in three losses. The following season, Cepeda
crushed the ball: .305, 34 homers, 111 RBIs. But after tailing off
in '71, he played just 28 games here in '72 before being traded to
Oakland for Denny McLain.
</P>
<P>
   Now 61, Cepeda has the same gap-toothed smile he flashed as a
young player. He wore a white Panama hat here, to protect his bald
head from the blazing summer sun. Since his selection in March,
Cepeda's life has been a whirlwind. He was honored by the Puerto
Rican government, flown home and driven from the airport in a
parade that wound through San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cepeda was the grand marshal of the Puerto Rican Day
parade in New York City. And Sunday in Cooperstown, his career, and
life, comes full circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling,'' said Cepeda. ``You feel like you've
accomplished everything as a baseball player. It seals everything.

 &HT;    Nicknames don't count for collector
 &HT;    By Andy Staples
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Billy Carter of Plains was famous for Billy Beer, and
for being the president's brother. Billy Carter of Mocksville,
N.C., is famous in collecting circles for being the ``full-name
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   And William Ray Carter couldn't have been happier than he was
Friday when he finally secured a William Felton Russell signature
on a basketball. Even if he did have to pay $375 for the signature
at the National Sports Collectors Convention, which runs through
Sunday at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   Former Celtics great Bill Russell would not speak to the media
Friday, but he did get a good laugh from Carter's request. Russell
only recently began signing autographs for the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high, but he's unique,'' Carter said. ``That's their
choice whether to sign. They've made what they are. Can you imagine
going everywhere and everyone bugging you?''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also got an Orlando Manuel Cepeda autograph Friday. He
said he has several Larry Wayne Jones Jr. signatures, minus the
Chipper moniker, and an autograph from William Theodore Walton III.
</P>
<P>
   The best item in his collection is a Cassius Marcellus Clay
autograph he got a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He may have a new champion after Sunday, though. That's when
Dikembe Mutombo Mpolondo Mukamba Jean Jacque Wamutombo will sign at
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   `League of Their Own'
</P>
<P>
   Several of the players from the all-female baseball league that
inspired the film ``A League of Their Own'' have a promotional
booth at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Lavonne ``Pepper Paire'' Davis is the former Racine Bells
catcher that Geena Davis' character was based on. Davis also was a
consultant for the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the young girls in the movie listened to our songs
and heard our stories,'' Davis said of the cast, which included
Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell. ``By the end, they were singing along
and acting like a real ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and several other players are signing autographs _ for
free _ at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Beanie mania continues
</P>
<P>
   Look out Mark McGwire, here comes Quackers the Duck. It seems
Beanie Babies may be just as popular _ if not more popular _ than
baseball cards at this year's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Osborn of M.C.J. Sports in St. Louis has been in the sports
collectibles business for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, he started dealing in Beanie Babies as
well. This year, he has a table in the sports memorabilia area of
the convention and one on the Beanie Baby Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Osborn expects the Beanies to do 10 times the business of the
baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both collector's items, but this year we'll do a lot
more in the Beanie business,'' Osborn said.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly. . .
</P>
<P>
   The convention opens at 10 a.m. today. It had been opening at
noon. ... Former ``Baywatch'' star Pamela Anderson will sign
autographs today from noon to 3 p.m. Autographs are $100, and it
costs $150 to take a picture with Anderson.

 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Tony Benn has roused a lot of passionate opinions since
he joined the House of Commons in 1950, but the one he most fears
now is approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the final corruption,'' he said in the basement office
of his Notting Hill house packed with the tapes and transcripts of
half a century of provocative comment.
</P>
<P>
   Papers hang from where he has stuck them to the ceiling, a
cockpit habit he picked up in wartime days as a Royal Air Force
pilot. ``It's this `dear old Tony' thing where they think you're
harmless and don't really mean what you say and they love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in a ``Dear Comrades'' letter to Labor Party
officers in his Chesterfield district, Benn announced that he would
not run for re-election. But he tried to head off notions that he
was giving up his role as prophet of Britain's left, giving robust
expression to the socialist ideology and trade union economics he
has always championed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of retiring and shall continue to work
closely with all those, outside and inside Parliament, who want to
see the Labor Party recommit itself to the causes of social
justice, democratic socialism and peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly the vexing tributes began. Alan Clark, a Conservative
member of Parliament, said: ``As a parliamentarian, he's tops. I
wouldn't mind having him as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Parris, a newspaper columnist and former Tory member of
Parliament whose district adjoined Benn's, credited him with
``rock-solid intellectual consistency, a single lifelong fight for
an unwavering set of beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   John O'Farrell, author of a Labor history, said he had inspired
generations of activists. ``If there'd been a poster of Tony Benn,
we would have had it on our walls, not Che Guevara,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Prime Minister Harold Wilson, in
whose government Benn served, said he had ``barmy ideas,'' pursued
``tomfool issues'' and represented ``a kind of aging perennial
youth _ he immatures with age.''
</P>
<P>
   Others called him a Communist, a loon, a parlor revolutionary,
an upper-class romantic, a calculating populist and ``Red Wedgie
Benn,'' a play on his socialist views and his long-discarded full
name with the unwanted aristocratic tones, Anthony Neil Wedgwood
Benn.
</P>
<P>
   The name he hated most of all was the one he had to change
British law to shed _ Viscount Stansgate, the Lord's title he
inherited on the death of his father in 1960. In a campaign that
first brought him to prominence in public life, he fought for three
years to get the legal right to turn down the hereditary title and
thereby remain in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Benn feels out of place in the Parliament he
struggled to remain a member of and in the party he began passing
out leaflets for as a 10-year-old in 1935. The boisterous Labor
assemblage of union heads, leftist ideologues and people whose
workplaces were mines, shipyards and factory floors has now become
a disciplined party of middle managers, suburban householders and
get-ahead-minded businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If guys are having a lousy deal, they want you there to
support them, and that's what I've tried to do in Parliament,''
Benn said. ``But now in Parliament, if you make a speech that
doesn't fit, then immediately all the political correspondents say
it is a coded attack on the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reporting of the argument; instead it's all this
personality rubbish and celebrities, celebrities. It's a litmus
test of loyalty to an individual, and I literally do think that
democracy is being destroyed in the nicest and politest possible
way. It has to be revitalized from the outside, and that is why
I've made the decision I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Punctuating his talk with sips of tea and draws on his pipe,
Benn warmed to the subject of whether a 74-year-old socialist was
out of date in modern Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the nature of work has changed; the term working class
is used to mean guys in overalls with dirty fingernails doing
manual work,'' he said. ``But actually the class distinction that
still matters is the difference between the earners who are 90
percent of the population and the owners who make up 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of quite well-paid people who were suddenly
thrown out in their 50's, and all of a sudden they realized that
all they had to sell was their labor, so the old idea is still
very, very relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Benn said he thought the great struggle of the 20th century had
been over the right to vote, but that victory was now being turned
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the power has gone somewhere else. It's gone to NATO, to
Brussels, it's gone to the World Trade Organization, it's gone to
Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch, to people who never get elected, and
so we're in a situation where we're far from Parliament or Congress
being there to protect people from the external powers, i.e., to
control the economy in the interest of the people,'' he said.
``Parliament is now there to control the people in the interests of
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   His goals are distinctly out of fashion in the party that Prime
Minister Tony Blair calls New Labor. While others set out in
pursuit of a ``third way,'' he sticks to his own well-trod one. He
is in favor of increasing income taxes to fund public services,
expanding the welfare state, rolling back privatization and
restoring full union rights. He is against nuclear weapons and
waging war unless it is approved by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   He is immensely proud of the entry of his 45-year-old son,
Hilary, into Parliament in a by-election in Leeds last month even
though the younger Benn proclaimed himself a committed New Labor
man. He campaigned as a ``Benn, not a Bennite,'' to which his
bemused father responded, ``Benns move left as they get older.''
</P>
<P>
   Benn's positions in the 1960s and 1970s included stints as
postmaster general, minister of technology, secretary for industry,
and secretary for energy. As a Labor Party officer, he fought for
the ``true faith'' of socialism, helping move the party to the left
in the 1970s in a fratricidal war that produced deep internal
divisions and kept it from regaining power until Blair and his
self-described ``modernizers'' moved it to the center and, not
incidentally, to electability.
</P>
<P>
   Benn was born in London in 1925, the son of William Wedgwood
Benn, a Liberal member of Parliament who later switched to Labor.
An Oxford graduate, he last month celebrated the 50th anniversary
of his marriage to Caroline Middleton, an American from Ohio. Benn
bought the park bench where he proposed from the Oxford Town
Council, and it sits in their overgrown front yard. The couple have
four children and nine grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His health is good though he wears hearing aids to correct a
condition that he quickly dismisses with an anecdote: ``It was a
very hot night in Bristol, and there was a heckler. I told him a
few times that he should run his own meeting rather than ruin ours,
and then I heard what he said. It was `Can we open a window?'''
</P>
<P>
   He dictates diary entries daily, and he estimates the word count
now tops 13 million. He has published seven volumes, and the next
one, which he goes out of his way to note will not be the last,
will cover the decade 1990-2000 and be titled ``Free at Last.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently purchased diary pages that carry him past his 100th
birthday, and he shows every confidence of being around to fill
them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final entry will be from St. Thomas' Hospital,'' he said.
``It will say, `I don't feel very well today.'''

 &HT;    UT's Hicks blocking thoughts of season-ending play
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ All Anthony Hicks knows about the controversial play
that ended his 1998 football season is what people have told him
about it.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't seen it. In fact, the University of Texas linebacker
would rather watch grainy replays of ``The Gong Show'' than see the
illegal chop block by Texas Tech wide receiver Derek Dorris that
ripped up Hicks' right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it. I don't care to look at it,'' Hicks said
Friday at the Big 12 Conference football media day. ``There's
nothing I can do about it now. I can't control what happened in the
past, so I just have got to live with it and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, a senior from Lake Highlands High in Dallas, was playing
his best ball of the season when he was cut down last Nov. 14 in
Lubbock. Two weeks earlier, he was the defensive star of the
Longhorns' victory at Nebraska, recording a career-high 13 tackles,
including five behind the line, to go with two sacks and two
quarterback pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But Dorris' block, which was penalized, brought Hicks' season to
a grinding halt, preventing him from playing in the season finale
against Texas A&AMP;M and the Cotton Bowl. And while he and Coach Mack
Brown believe he'll be ready to return this season _ Hicks will
move from his strong-side linebacker spot to the middle to assume
the leadership role vacated by Dusty Renfro _ there remains an
unsettling shadow of doubt until the Horns see how he responds when
veterans begin two-a-day workouts Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' injury was severe. Friday, he estimated his recovery at
between 85 percent and 90 percent, saying he occasionally still
experiences swelling, which he described as ``frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I believe I'll play,'' he said. ``You can't go into a
season with doubts. My doctors say it's well, and after working out
a lot, I think I'll be ready, too. It's just trying to get it
physically in shape to go through a season.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Hicks routinely will be limited to one practice a day
during two-a-days, especially if the knee swells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony's probably where Wane (McGarity) was this time last
year, and I didn't know this time last year if Wane would be able
to play,'' Brown said of the wide receiver. ``We'll be cautious,
like we are with all guys coming off knee surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Hicks, one of Texas' most experienced linebackers,
was moved to the middle for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about his experience, his ability to make the defensive
calls, his leadership qualities,'' Brown said. ``You've got to have
that guy in the middle who can step up and tell the defense that
we're OK, and we think Anthony can be that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, personable and accommodating, is more than willing to
talk about moving to the middle. ``It's not that much different.
Our three linebackers are pretty much interchangeable,'' Hicks
said. He'll also be glad to speculate on Texas' chances of
recapturing the magic of last year's 9-3 campaign or just about
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect him to dwell on what happened that fateful
November night in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it happened, I just took the mind-set that I can't dwell
on it and that I had to move on,'' said Hicks, who never heard from
Dorris. ``It was just something I really didn't want to mess with
because you guys would want to write about it. It doesn't make me
mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who had major knee surgery as a player at Florida State,
said he understands Hicks' insistence on putting the play behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hurt my knee, I would not see it,'' Brown said. ``It
takes awhile to get over it and you don't want to see it because it
is an emotional thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony's not angry. What happens with young players is they
get emotional for their teammate and they hate it because what they
saw was the disappointment in Anthony's eyes because he didn't get
to play against A&AMP;M or in the bowl game. The truth is, it was a
tough play because it was illegal. But there was a flag, so the
rules were handled properly. I'm sure the young man (Dorris) didn't
do it on purpose. No one wants to clip.''
</P>
<P>
   And regardless of the intent, Hicks doesn't want to see it.

<P>
   FUTUROSCOPE, France _ Amid scattered cries of ``la Broche, la
Broche,'' a nickname he despises, Laurent Brochard was making his
way to the sign-in for the 18th stage of the Tour de France on
Friday morning when the air was suddenly ringing with air horns,
screams and squeals.
</P>
<P>
   None of the tumult was meant for la Broche _ which means the
spit, as in a rotisserie _ but for the rider who had come up in his
wake: Richard Virenque.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it has always been.
</P>
<P>
   Brochard, 31, a Frenchman who rides for Festina, and Virenque,
29, a Frenchman who rides for Polti, were teammates the last few
years on the Festina team.
</P>
<P>
   Virenque was the leader, the winner four times of the Tour's
king of the mountains competition, the overall third-place finisher
two years ago and the fans' favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Brochard, who used to wear his hair in a long ponytail and sport
a bandana over his head, was a good support rider who unexpectedly
won the world road race championship in 1997 but was dogged by bad
crashes that limited further successes.
</P>
<P>
   They were both part of the nine-man team that was expelled from
the last Tour after Festina officials admitted that the riders used
illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Although Virenque has not made
such a confession, Brochard has. He served a six-month suspension
before he was reinstated by Festina with a 50 percent pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   In this Tour, Virenque won the polka-dot jersey of the best
climber again, ranks fifth over all _ the highest-placed Frenchman
by eight places _ and is again the darling of the French public,
which continues to post signs of support along every route.
Brochard, in 81st place, drew little encouragement from the fans
even when the race passed through his native region of the Sarthe
and has accomplished nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday, the last real chance for a Frenchman to win the
country's first stage before the grand finale in Paris on Sunday,
la Broche was not part of any attacks, not even a late one by 13
riders that produced a winner.
</P>
<P>
   That was Gianpaolo Mondini, an Italian with Cantina Tollo, who
left behind his traveling companions to triumph by three seconds at
the end of the 114-mile stage from the tidy village of Jonzac to
Futuroscope, a theme park devoted to technology.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Cyril Robin, a Frenchman with La Francaise des Jeux, was
second, and Aleksandr Vinokourov, a Kazakh with Casino, was third.
</P>
<P>
   Mondini was timed in 4 hours 17 minutes 43 seconds, a speed of
26 mph, on a breezy day before an enormous crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, the American leader of the U.S. Postal Service
team, retained the yellow jersey of the Tour's leader, with
Fernando Escartin, a Spaniard with Kelme, his nearest challenger,
more than six all-but-unrecuperable minutes behind.
</P>
<P>
   The start was delayed for the second successive day by a workers
protest; this time it was the farmers that were angry. Only
Virenque's many fans seem to have no grudge against the Tour _ even
though the Tour tried to ban him.
</P>
<P>
   Like Virenque, Brochard is not granting interviews during the
Tour. But he does not wear the enigmatic smile that his former
leader does. Brochard is stony-faced in his silence. The only sign
of individuality is the way he wears his long hair now, in small,
tight, beaded braids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget that part,'' Neil Stephens, another former Festina
rider, who retired after the expulsion, said of Brochard.
``Underneath he's very timid and a gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Brochard has had his moments other than the world championship.
In the 1996 Tour, he became one of the dozen Frenchmen to have won
the stage on July 14, the national holiday, and in 1993 he was
second in the French championship.
</P>
<P>
   The world championship, however, was his apex. When he went home
to Le Mans, the mayor presented him with a medal. The city's soccer
and basketball teams asked him to throw out the first ball at their
games. His fan club numbered 300. A month after his victory, 2,000
supporters flocked to a rally at a race track near his home to
honor him.
</P>
<P>
   After he won the championship, Brochard talked about a recurrent
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself passing the line, my arms raised,'' he said. ``I
hear the speaker screaming my name. I'm up on the podium and
they're giving me the rainbow-striped jersey. It fits me like a
glove.''
</P>
<P>
   Brochard was not allowed to ride for France and defend that
jersey after his expulsion from the Tour last year. Friday, he was
in Festina blue when he crossed the line in 50th place, simply
another face in the crowd, and just ahead of Virenque. &QL;

SOME UMPIRES RULED SAFE; OTHERS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a critical day of the major league umpires' job
action, baseball officials on Friday welcomed back the umpires who
had rescinded their resignations and, in effect, wished those who
had not farewell. Although no head count could be established
beyond any doubt because major league officials continued to
maintain silence, it appeared that 33 of 36 National League umpires
and at least nine of 32 American League umpires would lose their
jobs as a result of the letters of resignation they signed.
</P>
<P>
   According to several umpires, 14 AL umpires and two of their NL
colleagues had rescinded their resignations and saved their jobs.
One NL umpire and seven AL umpires were said to have never signed
letters of resignation. The other two AL umpires are not union
members.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Phillips, a veteran member of the AL staff, was one of the
umpires who learned that his employment would continue. ``An
American League official called,'' Phillips said in a telephone
interview, ``and said he was instructed by the commissioner's
office to call and tell everybody who has rescinded his resignation
at this point that it will be accepted. He emphasized `at this
point.'''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, the union leader, who orchestrated the
resignations, said he knew nothing about telephone calls to
rescinding umpires. But beyond that he had no comment, he said by
telephone from Cooperstown, N.Y., where he is attending the Hall of
Fame festivities.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball official who was not in Cooperstown and has not been
involved in the high-level meetings on the umpires said he believed
that any umpire who had rescinded his resignation by Thursday night
would be permitted to continue to work. The others, he said, would
be considered former employees as of the Sept. 2 resignation date
in their letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've hired minor league umpires on a full-time basis, not a
temporary basis, to replace the resigning umpires,'' the official
said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   According to information provided by several umpires, the
American League has hired 12 minor league umpires and the National
League has hired eight, all of whom have filled in for injured or
vacationing major league umpires. Two of them, Eric Cooper and Mike
DiMuro, son of Lou DiMuro, a former AL umpire, worked the
Yankees-Cleveland game at Yankee Stadium Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Other umpires identified four more of their colleagues who had
rescinded their resignations, bringing the total to 16. The new
names were all American Leaguers _ Rick Reed and Jim McKean, both
crew chiefs, plus Tim Tschida and Mike Reilly. McKean was also
working at Yankee Stadium Friday night, but along with Cooper and
DiMuro, he declined to speak with a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   One umpire had reported on Thursday that Larry Barnett, the
league's senior umpire, had changed his mind about revoking his
resignation, but others said Friday that he had not and was still
among the 16. The others are Wally Bell and Jeff Nelson of the NL
and Dave Phillips, Rocky Roe, Dale Scott, Jim Joyce, Al Clark, Gary
Cederstrom, Chuck Meriwether, Larry Young and Tim Welke, the last
two members of the union's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   One umpire's status was in dispute. A baseball official said
that Ted Hendry of the AL had not sent a letter of resignation, but
the union announced on Thursday that he had joined the resigning
group and on Friday Richie Phillips said, ``Ted Hendry has in fact
communicated a notification and that's all I'm going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hirschbeck of the NL and the AL's John Hirschbeck, Joe
Brinkman, Terry Craft, Durwood Merrill, Dan Morrison and Tim
McClelland also did not sign letters, umpires said. McClelland,
however, has spoken in support of the resignation movement.
</P>
<P>
   The AL umpires who have held to their resignations were
identified as Jim Evans and Richie Garcia, crew chiefs, and Ken
Kaiser, Ed Hickox, Dale Ford, Mark Johnson, Greg Kosc, Larry McCoy
and Drew Coble.
</P>
<P>
   The minor league umpires hired by the AL, along with Cooper and
DiMuro, were Doug Eddings, Marty Foster, Jim Reynolds, Bill Miller,
Laz Diaz, Ted Barrett, Brian O'Nora, Fieldin Culbreth, Mike Everitt
and Bill Welke, Tim's brother.
</P>
<P>
   The NL hired Phil Cuzzi, Marvin Hudson, C.B. Bucknor, Mark
Wegner, Ron Kulpa and Greg Gibson; Hunter Wendelstedt, son of a
recently retired NL umpire, Harry Wendelstedt, and Brian Runge, son
of Paul Runge, a former umpire and now an executive in the NL
office.

SCIENTIST FAKED DATA LINKING CANCER TO ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS,
PROBE FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to move up 1st reference to Glenn R. Woods to 8th graf,

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal probe has found that a scientist at the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., faked what had been
considered crucial evidence of a tie between electromagnetic
radiation and cancer. The disclosure appears to strengthen the case
that electric power is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Robert P. Liburdy, a cell biologist at the laboratory, an arm of
the Energy Department, was found to have published two papers with
misleading data. Investigators said Liburdy eliminated data that
did not support his conclusions. After the investigation, he
resigned quietly from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in March and
has agreed to withdraw his research findings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say his misrepresentations helped him win $3.3
million in grants from the National Institutes of Health, the
Department of Energy and the Department of Defense to investigate a
link between electric power and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Debate has raged for decades over whether power lines cause
cancer even though top scientific groups such as the National
Academy of Sciences have repeatedly found no evidence of danger.
But other researchers say enough tantalizing clues keep emerging to
warrant further investigations of possible links between
electromagnetic radiation and killer diseases, sowing seeds of
anxiety among people living near high-tension power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't gotten these results, nobody would have paid any
attention,'' a federal investigator in the case, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two papers reported data indicating that electromagnetic
fields, also known as EMF, exert a biological effect by altering
the entry of calcium across a cell's surface membrane. The fields
are ubiquitous forms of radiation that arise from all power lines,
home wiring and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say Liburdy's claims were potentially very
important when published in 1992 because they purported to link
electromagnetic fields to calcium signaling, which is a fundamental
process governing many important cellular functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he originally published these papers, there was quite a
bit of interest in it,'' said Glenn R. Woods, the laboratory's
counsel. ``Now both the lab and the Office of Research Integrity
have found that data on which he based his conclusions were
fabricated. He's been asked to withdraw that data, and I think he's
doing that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his federal settlement, Liburdy has agreed to make no
applications for federal grants for three years and not to contest
the federal findings in administrative proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Liburdy can, however, disagree publicly with the misconduct
findings, and he is doing so vigorously, professing his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics probe of Liburdy began after a whistle-blower
challenged his intriguing results. In July 1995, the Lawrence
Berkeley Lab determined that Liburdy had indeed falsified data, and
it alerted the Office of Research Integrity, an arm of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the integrity office announced its findings in the
Federal Register, saying Liburdy had ``engaged in scientific
misconduct in biomedical research by falsifying and fabricating
data and claims about the purported cellular effects of electric
and magnetic fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in letters sent over the Internet to scientific
colleagues and interested parties, Liburdy has denied that his
research is wrong and said he agreed to the federal settlement only
because he was unable to spend $1 million to mount a legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The raw data for these figures is not challenged, and is
valid,'' Liburdy wrote in one letter. ``How I graphed them is a
matter of disagreement among scientists. Independent scientists
have reviewed this for me and concluded that misconduct is not
warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed that ``none of my scientific conclusions in the
two papers are being retracted,'' only the disputed published data.
</P>
<P>
   Requests for further comments left Friday at Liburdy's residence
in Tiburon, just north of San Francisco, went unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Federal experts vigorously disagree with Liburdy's defense and
claims of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a matter of interpretation or graphing,'' said the
investigator. ``This is fabrication and falsification. He can
express his opinion, but not to an appeal board.''
</P>
<P>
   In misconduct cases, especially ones involving large sums of
money, the federal government can bring civil or criminal charges,
and the defendant can be fined and sentenced to jail. In this case,
officials say, they concluded that an administrative remedy was
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the settlement with Liburdy are detailed in the
June 17 Federal Register. The notice says Liburdy ``neither admits
or denies'' the finding of scientific misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say Liburdy did not spend all of the $3.3
million in grant money, and that the remainder is controlled by the
Lawrence Berkeley Lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being used for other science'' and none of it has been
returned to the federal government, Woods said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Liburdy's two disputed papers both appeared in 1992, and in both
cases he was the lone author.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, ``Biological interactions of cellular systems with
time-varying magnetic fields,'' appeared in the Annals of the New
York Academy of Sciences. ``Calcium signaling in lymphocytes in ELF
fields'' appeared in FEBS Letters, published by the Federation of
European Biochemical Societies.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Liburdy's research appeared, more than 20
studies have found no hard evidence that electric power causes
cancer, a National Institutes of Health panel concluded recently.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Park, a professor of physics at the University of
Maryland who has long questioned the power-cancer link, said
Liburdy's deception was probably typical for the field, which he
said seems to attract crusaders out to vilify industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's often not deliberate fraud either,'' Park said of slanted
data. ``People are awfully good at fooling themselves. They're so
sure they know the answer that they don't want to confuse people
with ugly-looking data.''
</P>
<P>
   In the power line debate, Park added, the proponents of danger
``were desperately looking for a physical effect, and the nearest
they could come by was the calcium signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing consensus among researchers seems to be that
electric power is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a large, meticulously designed study found no
evidence that electromagnetic fields emanating from power lines
cause leukemia in children. The study was a collaboration between
scientists at the National Cancer Institute and childhood leukemia
specialists from the nation's leading medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 636 children with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, the most common childhood cancer, and 620 healthy
children who were matched to the cancer patients by race, age and
residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists tracked the children's exposure to the fields that
power lines produce, but found no relationship between exposure and
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Park said the new findings of power-cancer misrepresentation
will aid the emerging consensuses on safety. ``But I'm not sure how
strongly,'' he added, as other scientists are still investigating
and advancing the idea of a cancer linkage.

   Belgium: A Pork Scare
</P>
<P>
   Belgium plunged into another food-safety crisis after its new
government banned the sale of pork from more than 200 farms after
discovering toxic levels of cancer-causing dioxin chemicals in pork
fat. The new ban comes after a scandal over contamination of eggs,
poultry, beef and dairy products. Public uproar led to the election
June 13 of a new government under Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt,
who plans to start a food safety agency.

<P>
   The budget for the preservation of memorials at former Nazi
concentration camps is to be increased from $16 million next year
to $27 million by 2003, Germany's top cultural official said.
Michael Naumann, who said last year that the camps provided the
most effective evocation of the Holocaust, made the announcement
after construction of a vast Berlin memorial close to the
Brandenburg Gate was approved by Parliament. The money will go to
former camps at Sachsenhausen, Bergen-Belsen and Dachau, among
others.

AFTER EARLY STRUGGLES, GALAXY SHOWS SIGNS OF LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Paul Caligiuri remembers the runaway train
known as the Los Angeles Galaxy last season. The team got off to a
fast start, scoring goals in record numbers while building an
insurmountable lead in Major League Soccer's Western Conference. By
the All-Star break, the Galaxy had nearly locked up home-field
advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, being the best regular-season team meant
little. The Galaxy was swept in the Western Conference finals by
the Chicago Fire, the eventual MLS champion.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri puts all that in perspective as the Galaxy prepares to
begin the second half of the season Sunday (12:30 p.m.) against the
Kansas City Wizards at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt much different at this stage last year,'' Caligiuri
said. ``We had such a big lead on everyone, every game didn't feel
as important. It was easy to relax, easy to feel comfortable with
the situation. That's certainly not the case this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization has gone through numerous changes since the end
of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Denver-based billionaire Philip F. Anschutz bought the team for
$26million last fall. The loss of Martin Machon and Wellington
Sanchez and the holdout of Mauricio Cienfuegos hurt the Galaxy's
attendance in the early season. The team started slowly (2-3),
prompting the firing of coach Octavio Zambrano and the hiring of
former UCLA coach Sigi Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Galaxy continued to struggle under Schmid. The
team that was once a scoring machine is on pace to score the fewest
goals ever in an MLS season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning of the season was definitely a disappointment to
everyone involved in the organization,'' goalkeeper Kevin Hartman
said. ``Last year we kind of put everyone out of reach and this
season we have struggled to keep pace.''
</P>
<P>
   As Schmid tinkered with the lineup, he sought foreign
acquisitions Elliott (New Zealand) and Roy Myers (Costa Rica). Some
questioned those selections, but Elliott and Myers have solidified
the Galaxy's struggling midfield. And now that everyone's had time
to adjust, the Galaxy is showing new signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will all start to work out now,'' said assistant
coach Ralph Perez. ``Seventy-five percent or more of our games are
against teams in the West. And when you're talking head-to-head,
you're talking six-point swings.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring only eight goals in its first 12 games, the Galaxy
has gone on a tear, scoring 14 goals in its last five games. The
team has won five of its last six matches, including a 5-2 victory
over New England before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri said he saw the improvements coming and he knew it was
only a matter of time before the team started responding to Schmid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Octavio took over the team (in 1997, replacing Lothar
Osiander) we went on a binge right away and completely turned
everything around,'' Caligiuri said. ``This time it took time to
make adjustments, time for Sigi to get to know the players and how
they play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets to know you individually so he's able to find a
balance and bring out the best in each player. He's made subtle
changes, bringing in Simon and Roy. And our training sessions have
been shorter in time but more intense. I think all of the players
have responded, both physically and mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the season, Schmid and the Galaxy can
focus on catching the Western Conference leaders. Colorado (12-4,
32 points), Chicago (10-7, 28 points) and Dallas (10-9, 28 points)
are all within reach for Los Angeles (10-7, 24 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt all along that we wanted to be within striking distance
at this point and here we are,'' said Schmid. ``We have eight games
against teams that are ahead of us and we need to take care of
those to control our own destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial goal was to establish a team camaraderie and have
confidence in each other. I think we've done that fairly well.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the midfield, where Elliott and Myers have
settled comfortably alongside Cienfuegos, the Galaxy has made great
strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two have had a big influence, but I think as a team
we've shown an ability to be more direct than when I first came
in,'' said Schmid, ``... and we've improved our compactness, both
offensively and defensively.''

VENTURA CALLS FOR NEW REFORM PARTY LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota opened the
national convention of the Reform Party on Friday by saying he
would not accept a draft as the party's nominee for president next
year, but nevertheless suggesting it was time for the party's
founder, Ross Perot, to allow new leaders to take over.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day convention seems almost certain to climax with a
power struggle between the two men on Sunday, when the delegates
will choose a new national chairman. Russell Verney, the founding
chairman and a longtime aide to Perot, has decided not to run
again, and Ventura has endorsed a candidate who has said he would
move the headquarters out of Dallas, Perot's base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   In a veiled but unmistakable shot at Perot, Ventura declared
that ``party politics has a funny way of destroying common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of our party is that it is made up of individuals
_ it is not a group of people forced to march to a party line,'' he
said. ``Politics as a game of power undercuts our national
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, whose victory in November was the first in which a
Reform Party candidate won statewide office, told the 400 delegates
that they could win the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for the Reform Party,'' he said.
``Voters are very suspicious of the two major parties. It used to
take tens of millions of dollars of special-interest money to get
elected president. Now, it takes hundreds of millions of
special-interest money.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``In 1998, Minnesota shocked the world. It's time for
America to shock the world in the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot is to address the party on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura spoke by telephone hookup after he was unable to fly
into Detroit because of storms, but delegates whooped and applauded
at the vacant podium, responding the loudest when he attacked the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not trust them,'' he said. ``They are not into reporting
the news anymore _ they are into creating news. As I've stated
unequivocally, I have made no mention of running for national
office, yet the media continues to create news and put me up as a
national candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Citing his promises in the Minnesota campaign, he said he would
not be a candidate for ``higher public office'' until finishing his
term.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura began with a tribute to Perot. ``From him, we've learned
that a third party can be taken seriously if its leaders use common
sense and demonstrate they are in touch with the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then he changed his tone abruptly as he told the delegates,
``Be fair and open with all the elections that take place at the
convention and please hear different viewpoints, because that's the
great thing about the Reform Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney, who also serves as Perot's spokesman, has said either of
the other two candidates for chairman, Pat Benjamin of New Jersey
or Thomas McLaughlin of Pennsylvania, would do a fine job.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura concluded by personally issuing an endorsement of the
third candidate, Jack Gargan, who has said he would move the
party's headquarters to his home state of Florida. Ventura had
shocked the party earlier by endorsing Gargan in an e-mail message
to some delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a vision, leadership to make the Reform Party the
leading political force in America for the next millennium,''
Ventura said Friday night. ``Let's go into the new millennium as
one and show those Democrats and Republicans we are not going
away.''

MICROSOFT-AOL FEUD ERUPTS OVER INSTANT MESSAGING SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS 19 states in lawsuit in 9th graf) (lh) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online Friday closed its online service to people using
new software from two of its fiercest rivals, Microsoft and Yahoo,
that had been designed to tap into one of America Online's most
popular features: instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, both Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo introduced software
that could send messages to some 40 million users of AOL Instant
Messaging, a program that enables people to hold ``real time''
dialogs. Unlike standard e-mail, which arrives in a recipient's
in-box to be read only when it is opened, instant-messaging
software places a message in an open window on the recipient's
computer screen only seconds after it is sent.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike e-mail, these systems have until now been closed,
meaning that users of one system cannot connect to users of
another.
</P>
<P>
   AIM is part of the software distributed to America Online's 17
million members, and it is available for free as a stand-alone
product to anyone who takes the time to download the program from
www.aol.com. Many computer manufacturers also install it on all
their machines.
</P>
<P>
   Its widespread use has made it a de facto standard for instant
messaging over the Internet, which is why Microsoft, the world's
biggest software company, and Yahoo, the most heavily trafficked
site on the World Wide Web, designed their software so that it
could interact with AIM. But this is not a simple matter of
adopting the same rules for addressing the messages, because one of
AIM's most popular and useful features is its ``buddy list,'' which
notifies a user when friends or others on the user's list log on to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To determine which users of AIM are online at any given time,
the new products from Microsoft and Yahoo had to blaze a path into
America Online's servers in a way that America Online says violated
its copyrights and trademark
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, America Online blocked both products, as
last month it had blocked a similar product by Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft refused to roll over. Late Friday, the software
giant said it had revised its MSN Messenger program to circumvent
America Online's block. Within hours, America Online answered that
challenge with a new block.
</P>
<P>
   The feud is an odd reversal of the war over Internet browsers
between Microsoft and Netscape Communications Corp., which America
Online now owns. Now, Microsoft is arguing that America Online is
using its exclusive technology to prevent fair competition based on
open standards. That is exactly the complaint from Netscape that
prompted the U.S. Justice Department and 19 states to file an
antitrust suit against Microsoft now being tried in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous because instant messages have become one
of the most popular uses of the Internet, letting users chat
throughout the day with their friends.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   America Online believes so strongly in instant messages that
last year it paid $325 million for a competing instant-message
service called ICQ (for I Seek You), even though it had never
earned a dime of revenue. Today, America Online's two
instant-message services have 80 million users, who send 780
million messages a day, more than all the mail handled in a day by
the U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   America Online argues that the programs offered by Microsoft and
Yahoo were inappropriately gaining access to its internal computer
systems without its permission.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, users of both the Microsoft and Yahoo programs are
asked to type in their America Online password, something America
Online discourages. Indeed, one of the most common abuses on
America Online is when hackers pretend to be customer service
representatives and ask innocent users for their passwords.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are undermining all the efforts that AOL has put into
making an environment that people can trust,'' said Ann Brackbill,
a spokeswoman for the company. Internet executives argued that
America Online is hurting its own users by this policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I demand that all my friends use the same
instant-message system in order to communicate with me,'' said
Steve Glenn, chief executive of People Link, which makes
instant-message software. ``What is right is for consumers to have
a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   There are efforts by an industry consortium to develop a
standard so that Instant messages, like e-mail, can be exchanged
universally. But that standard has not been completed, nor has
America Online committed to comply with it.
</P>
<P>
   In the mean time, Microsoft, which is a latecomer to the
instant-message business, used a technique called reverse
engineering to make its software mimic the behavior of AOL's own
program. This is no different, the company argues, than if it found
a way to make its word processing program read files created by
competing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big benefit for our users if they can speak with
someone on any instant-message system,'' said Deanna Sanford, a
product manager with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo and Prodigy say they didn't need to use reverse
engineering because America Online actually published the
specifications to its instant-messaging system on its Internet site
and authorized other people to link into it.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, America Online did create a version of the
instant-messaging program using the increasingly popular structure
known as open source software, in which programs are published in a
form that users can see how they work and make modifications. The
most popular open source programs are Linux, a rapidly growing
version of the Unix operating system, and AOL's Netscape Navigator
browser which was shifted to open source last year.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said that the only reason it published an open
source version of its instant-messaging program was so that Linux
users could communicate with each other and with their friends who
used AOL's other products. The company said it never intended for
companies to use that version as the basis for a mass market
product.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo and Prodigy said that America Online had clearly made
the instant-message system available for them to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We based our product on the America Online site, which never
once said there were limits as to who this was intended for,'' said
Brian Park, a senior producer at Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kirkner, the chief technology officer of Prodigy, said
America Online was being ``disingenuous'' to cut off that company's
message system after publishing the open source version.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how the Internet works. People build software, and
other people build on it and improve it,'' Kirkner said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that America Online has told Prodigy that it in order to
let its users send messages to AOL users, Prodigy must pay a fee
and use AOL's proprietary AOL messaging software, which carries
advertising that AOL sells.

   NEW YORK _ America's two largest stock markets, the New York
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market, are moving quickly to convert
from non-profit institutions to for-profit corporations, with the
New York exchange confirming Friday that it could be ready to sell
shares to the public as early as mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is that before people sit down to their Thanksgiving
dinner, they will be able to look up the shares of the New York
Stock Exchange in that day's newspaper and see how they are
trading,'' said Richard Grasso, president of the exchange, in an
interview Friday. The exchange's 1,366 members could be asked to
vote on the historic transformation as early as mid-September,
Grasso said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Nasdaq market may not be far behind. Senior market
officials confirmed Friday that the board of Nasdaq's parent
organization, the National Association of Securities Dealers, will
review on Thursday a finely detailed plan that could result in the
Nasdaq market becoming a publicly traded corporation by early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   If the proponents of of the plans are right, these conversions
could produce healthier, better financed, more adaptable American
markets for investors seeking profits and entrepreneurs raising
capital. With new competitors emerging daily and electronic
networks changing the financial landscape, leaders of both markets
emphasized that they must act quickly to preserve their dominant
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden rush to become public companies leaves unanswered
for now some key questions about how to regulate these markets and
contain their near-monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's two premier stock markets are now structured
roughly along the lines of member-owned country clubs _ only the
members in this case are the corporate citizens of Wall Street,
ranging from giants like Merrill Lynch with a commanding presence
in both markets to small independent brokers who own a single seat
on the New York exchange. Like country clubs, these non-profit
institutions cover their expenses by charging fees to those who use
their services, imposing commissions on each trade, annual dues for
each company listed for trading, and separate fees for access to
the stock quotations generated by each market's trading activity.
</P>
<P>
   But just as a country club must balance the interest of the
tennis players who want more courts against golfers who want better
greens, the exchanges are controlled by large cumbersome boards
whose ability to act quickly has been impaired by conflicting
interests among its members.
</P>
<P>
   As corporations with publicly traded stock, Nasdaq and the New
York exchange could more easily acquire complementary businesses,
including upstart networks that are nibbling away at their trading
volume. Moreover, they could generate new profits by developing
proprietary products or forming joint ventures with markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But by adopting a corporate structure, the two markets would
also face the pressures that confront other companies in an age of
low inflation, constant downsizing and aggressive takeovers: the
need to price their services competitively and yet still generate
profits for their demanding and potentially fickle stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of for-profit stock exchanges has already gained
ground in Europe and the Far East. The Stockholm Stock Exchange
became a subsidiary of a publicly traded corporation, OM Gruppa, in
1993. Since then, at least a half-dozen other exchanges, from
Iceland to Singapore, have converted to for-profit status, and two
others, in Toronto and Hong Kong, are studying the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept remains untested in the United States, although
the Chicago Board of Trade and two small regional exchanges _ the
Pacific Coast Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange _ are
also exploring the option.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets are not merely stock-trading businesses, of
course. Since the early 1930s, American stock markets have been
vested with important self-policing responsibilities, noted
Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University. ``To the
extent that you make them for-profit, and especially, that you open
up their ownership to the general public _ boy, that role becomes a
whole lot harder to fill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both Nasdaq and the Big Board already possess enormous
power in the market for the world's stock-trading business. ``The
exercise of that power will be easier when each is a for-profit
entity,'' he said. ``The incentives will be stronger and the
mechanisms more available.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders of America's two major markets have seen upstart
for-profit competitors nibble away at their trading volume over the
past two years. These upstart trading networks can in some cases
offer faster, customized services to powerful institutional
investors and to the burgeoning group of online brokerage
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of proposals, after months of Wall Street
speculation, and the rapid acceleration in the pace of the
discussions reflect the growing certainty among the markets'
leaders that only a corporate structure can give them the ready
access to capital, the ability to make critical acquisitions and
the decision-making speed that they need to a compete effectively
against an increasingly crowded field of new electronic rivals at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you do what we propose,'' a senior NASD official said
of the Nasdaq plan, ``the value of this place diminishes in a
dramatic fashion in a very short period of time.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Grasso, at the New York exchange, agreed. ``The landscape is
changing so quickly,'' he said Friday. ``We are competing against
competitors who are publicly owned. We need the potential supply of
capital and the flexibility to have common stock as a script to
acquire other marketplaces or other market entities around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Grasso sent the Wall Street rumor mill into overdrive when he
met privately on Wednesday evening with several hundred exchange
members to brief them on a proposal that he expects to be ready for
the exchange's board of governors the first week in September.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that meeting Friday, he said that the members who
attended were ``very, very supportive and enthusiastic,'' although
there are still key details to be worked out with the help of
Merrill Lynch, which is advising the exchange on a pro bono basis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key issues that Merrill has been asked to explore
before the September board meeting, Grasso said, is the tax
treatment of the transaction and how it would affect the exchange's
members.
</P>
<P>
   According to Grasso, the preliminary plan calls for each seat on
the stock exchange to be converted into two new instruments: the
first could be ``a perpetual trading permit or license, that can be
leased or sold,'' and the second would be common stock in the new
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the exchange would undertake an initial public offering,
selling some quantity of new shares to the public and thereby
offering its founding shareholders _ its seat-holding members _ the
opportunity to sell some or all of their own stake. Among the new
company's assets, besides its potent brand, would be the New York
exchange's existing stakes in several key pieces of Wall Street's
backstage infrastructure, including National Securities Clearing
Corp. and the co-operative organization that sells real-time market
data to the brokerage community.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq proposal, while still a work in progress, is
complicated slightly by the structure of its parent organization,
NASD, which is composed of all of the nation's license securities
dealers. NASD, besides owning the Nasdaq market, also operates the
American Stock Exchange and a separate regulatory and arbitration
unit, called NASD-R.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the Nasdaq proposal said it envisions
selling of the Nasdaq market as a for-profit corporation; upgrading
the electronic backbone of the AMEX with an eye toward taking it
public at some point in future; and retaining the regulatory unit
as part of the parent organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some ``substantial portion'' of the proceeds of a Nasdaq sale
would then be earmarked to finance the parent organization's
regulatory function, either with an endowment or the purchase of an
annuity.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange, for now at least, is taking a very
different approach to the task of carrying out its self-policing
obligations. According to Grasso, it envisions retaining its
regulatory unit as part of the new corporation.
</P>
<P>
   He has shared details of the plan with Arthur Levitt, chairman
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Grasso said, ``He is
very enthusiastic and supportive, although there are lots of issues
to be explored.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASD has proposed that the markets combine their regulatory
unit into a single free-standing entity, but it poses extremely
complicated issues, he explained. With the current pace of market
competition, he said, ``I cannot spend six to 12 months looking at
how to posture a self-regulatory group.''
</P>
<P>
   But some market experts argue that such questions are too
important to be postponed. ``You have to ask how you regulate them
_ how do you make sure that they have the capacity, the reliability
and processing integrity?'' said Joseph Anastasio, a partner in
Capital Markets Co., an international market consultant. With
public shareholders constantly demanding profit growth, he said,
``what is the incentive to invest beyond the next quarter?''
</P>
<P>
   While he and other market experts agreed that quicker
decision &UR;  &LR; making is essential, they argue that both could
potentially be achieved simply by streamlining the governing
structure of the existing institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But under the structure at the New York exchange, it is so
cumbersome for management to win consensus from all the competing
constituencies that ``the decision &UR;  &LR; making and implementation
process is slowed down,'' said Richard Rosenblatt, whose firm
leases five seats on the New York exchange. ``Something has to
change _ it doesn't have to be the corporate structure, but that is
the easiest way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same conflicts beset the membership of NASD, as well, with
online brokers squaring off against the giant full-service brokers,
and traditional market makers competing against new proprietary
trading services, called electronic communications networks, or
ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   It is less clear whether NASD leadership has the same support
for its proposal that Grasso claims. But one senior market official
said that he believes all NASD members ``want an organization that
can be responsive and competitive _ and one in which they can have
a direct investment, so they can profit from it and be confident
that the organization will be responsive and competitive in the
years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASD board of directors will get a look at the current staff
proposal for privatization when it meets on Thursday in New York,
several board members said. But the NASD leadership believes that
any formal spinoff of the Nasdaq market should be postponed until
after the securities industry has safely navigated the computer
date-change issues that will arise at the end of this year.
``Everybody has a lot on their plate already,'' one market official
said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the simple stone church where his mother brought
him to worship as a small boy, John F. Kennedy Jr., the country's
most famous namesake, was remembered as a young man who shouldered
the ponderous weight of legend and was still ``becoming the person
he would be'' in a memorial Mass Friday that united generations and
ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot, sunshiny morning, an eclectic mix of some 350 mourners
_ from the eminent figures of his father's administration to his
childhood hero, Muhammad Ali, to President Clinton, to many young
friends _ gathered in somber attire at the compact Roman Catholic
St. Thomas More Church on the Upper East Side to honor Kennedy and
his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts delivered an affecting
eulogy laced with eloquence and wit in which he said that Kennedy,
as the only son of the 35th president of the United States,
``seemed to belong not only to our family, but to the American
family. The whole world knew his name before he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the still embryonic stage of his career, he said,
``He had only just begun. There was in him a great promise of
things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   When the senator finished the 10-minute tribute, Caroline
Kennedy, the only sibling of John Kennedy, stood up and hugged him.
</P>
<P>
   Wyclef Jean, the lead singer of a hip-hop group, The Fugees,
apparently a favorite of Kennedy's, was chosen as the soloist for
the ceremony and sang the Jimmy Cliff reggae song, ``Many Rivers to
Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   The public claim to the Kennedys was evident in the hundreds of
people who clotted the streets around the church on East 89th
Street between Madison and Park Avenue hours before the service
began at 11 a.m., drawn by curiosity and grief.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral of Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,
in 1994, the audio of the service was played over television and
radio stations. No such arrangements were made for Friday's Mass.
But the fact that the onlookers could see little and hear nothing
seemed irrelevant to their compulsion to be there.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Kennedy, 38, along with his wife and her sister,
Lauren Bessette, in the nighttime crash of the plane he was
piloting, has been a weeklong and heartfelt absorption for a
nation, and this final formal tribute was the culmination.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The mourners at the invitation-only Mass included a
preponderance of family members and political figures. President
Clinton attended with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and their
daughter, Chelsea. Caroline Kennedy came with her husband, Edwin
Schlossberg, and their three children. There was Ethel Kennedy;
Robert Kennedy Jr.; Maurice Tempelsman, the long-time companion of
Mrs. Onassis; three Kennedy sisters, Jean Kennedy Smith, Patricia
Kennedy Lawford and Eunice Kennedy Shriver; Maria Shriver,
Kennedy's cousin, and Ms. Shriver's husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others were Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts. From his father's era were Robert S.
McNamara, the former secretary of defense; John Kenneth Galbraith,
the economist; Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, and Theodore
C. Sorensen, a special counsel to President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The altar of the church was plainly decorated with a spread of
white roses. Before the service began, Anne Freeman, the mother of
Carolyn and Lauren Bessette, read from ``Facts of the Faith,'' a
compilation of sermons by Henry Scott Holland: ``Death is nothing
at all. It does not count. I have only slipped away.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy read 11 lines from Prospero's speech in
Shakespeare's ``The Tempest,'' that began, ``Our revels now are
ended,'' and concluded, ``We are such stuff as dreams are made on,
and our little life is rounded with a sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Radziwill, daughter of Lee Radziwill, Mrs. Onassis'
younger sister, read a passage from ``The Book of Ruth,'' and her
brother, Anthony, recited Psalm 23, ``The Lord Is My Shepherd.''
The director Mike Nichols, who at one time escorted Mrs. Onassis
around New York, attended with his wife, Diane Sawyer, and read
from Revelation 21:17. The gospel for the Mass was Luke 21.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Charles O'Byrne, who presided at the wedding of John
Kennedy and Carolyn Bessette, gave the homily, speaking about the
joy of participating in the preparations for the secretive ceremony
that was held off the coast of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons presented the Kennedy and Bessette families with
albums of photographs of Kennedy and his wife when they visited the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton South, a friend of the Bessette family, eulogized
Carolyn Bessette by praising her caring ways and the simple aspects
of her style and approach to life.
</P>
<P>
   In his eulogy, Senator Kennedy thanked the Clintons for their
presence and told of how, when they once asked John Kennedy Jr.
what he would do if he were ever elected president, Kennedy had
replied, ``I guess the first thing is call up Uncle Teddy and
gloat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that,'' the senator said. ``It was so like his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   There was many aspects to Kennedy's life _ fame, power, wealth
and expectation _ but the eulogy centered on his unpretentious
nature and zest for life and adventure, on how he ``lived as if he
were unrecognizable'' and ``thought politics should be an integral
part of our popular culture and that popular culture should be an
integral part of politics.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed at the senator's story of his nephew arriving
in Massachusetts to campaign for him in 1994 with an enormous
German shepherd named Sam that he had just rescued from the pound
and kept in his hotel room with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and his bride have gone to be with his mother and father,
where there will never be an end to love,'' he said. ``He was lost
on that troubled night, but we will always wake for him, so that
his time, which was not doubled, but cut in half, will live forever
in our memory, and in our beguiled and broken hearts.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Senator Kennedy's voice cracked at two junctures, when he spoke
affectionately of Kennedy and his wife, surrounded by Caroline
Kennedy, her family and other relatives, sailing together on
Nantucket Sound and when, near the end, he said, ``We dared to
think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would
live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But
like his father, he had every gift but length of years.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy's eulogy, the O Freedom Gospel Choir sang,
``Amazing Grace,'' and the 90-minute service came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The grievers began to arrive shortly after 9 a.m., passing
through intense security, and beneath sharpshooters positioned in
the tower of the church and atop adjacent buildings. Residents who
lived in the tall apartment houses across from the church were
asked to stay away from their windows.
</P>
<P>
   From the early morning into mid-afternoon, the neighborhood for
blocks around the church was at a standstill, with streets shut
down and traffic diverted. Television camera trucks, limousines and
police cars commanded all the available parking spots. A number of
businesses along Madison Avenue, including banks and boutiques,
simply did not open for business because no patrons could get to
them.
</P>
<P>
   The 126-year-old Gothic-style church, with just 15 rows of pews
graced with crimson velvet cushions, is where Jacqueline Kennedy
worshipped with her children after she moved to a nearby Fifth
Avenue apartment in 1963 after the assassination of President
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The service was a memorial rather than a funeral Mass, because a
funeral Mass demands that the remains of the deceased be present.
Though mention was made of Lauren Bessette at Friday's service, a
separate candlelight Mass for her is scheduled for Saturday evening
in Greenwich, Conn., where she and her sisters grew up and her
mother and stepfather live.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as soon as people learned of the plans for the
memorial Mass at St. Thomas More, visitors flocked to the church to
deposit bouquets of flowers, stuffed animals and affectionate
messages outside its entranceway, much as they had all week long on
the sidewalk in front of the Tribeca apartment building where
Kennedy and his wife lived. The expressions of grief were cleared
out from in front of the church Thursday night in preparation for
the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Morey, 32, spent all night traveling from Cleveland to
stand outside during the service. She came with her 10-month-old
child, her sister and their mother. ``The saddest thing about this
is the unfulfilled potential and he didn't live long enough to be a
father himself,'' Ms. Morey said. ``I think he embodied everything
that was good about society.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, the mourners filed out of the church and walked
somberly up Madison Avenue two blocks to the School of the Sacred
Heart, which Caroline Kennedy attended as a child, for a luncheon
reception. Caroline Kennedy and her family rode in a limousine to
the school, and as they passed the hushed crowd waving at her, she
rolled down her window and, tears in her eyes, waved back.
</P>
<P>
   Once all the guests had left, 89th Street was reopened by the
police and onlookers crowded in front of the small church. Some
stuck fresh bouquets and notes of condolence into the closed black
metal gate. For some time, they just stood there, not wanting to
leave.

PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL COLISEUM PARKING REVEALED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That new NFL-in-Los Angeles partnership released
its site plan for Exposition Park on Friday, showing two parking
structures that would add approximately 14,000 spaces to the area.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with existing parking and parking planned for the
California Science Center and California African American Museum,
the immediate Exposition Park area would have 20,400 spaces
available for NFL games at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Chadwick, Gov. Gray Davis' designated representative to
help bring the two rival groups competing for an NFL franchise
together in the expansion bid, did not release the group's new
renderings for the Coliseum itself.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick estimates the parking structures, modeled after the
multi-tiered garages first proposed by the Michael Ovitz-Ron Burkle
group, would cost close to $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Eli Broad-Ed Roski Jr. group had promoted a single garage
for approximately 7,000 spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick, who has been assigned to the project for less than two
months, is scheduled to present the new site plan and a Coliseum
renovation proposal to NFL owners next week in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we're making a lot of progress,'' Chadwick
said. ``I don't know if we've made enough progress, but we've sure
covered a lot of territory in six weeks. I'm enthusiastic and
optimistic. I think this a very good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The main parking garage would hold 10,500 spaces and be at the
corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Figueroa Street. As
proposed by Ovitz, a park would be built atop the 24-foot structure
that would include two full soccer fields and four small soccer
fields.
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Arena would have to be demolished to construct the
main parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   A secondary garage with almost 4,000 spaces would be constructed
on Vermont, just south of its intersection with Exposition
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick is finalizing a financing proposal for the parking
structures that would mostly utilize taxable and tax-exempt bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan and Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas are also
investigating the possibility of acquiring 10 to 16 acres on
Figueroa for a retail complex that could add additional parking.
</P>
<P>
   The new plans for the stadium itself are also expected to be
modeled closely after Ovitz's Roman Coliseum design, with a seating
capacity of approximately 62,000, expandable to 80,000 for Super
Bowls and bigger USC games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league doesn't care if it looks like the Roman Coliseum or
the Seattle Kingdome,'' Roski said. ``The league is concerned with
its functionality _ with its club seats, the parking, how it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The don't care if you paint it purple, as long as it's
functional. They're very interested in this building. This is where
they could have a Super Bowl every three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan has remained largely in the background during the
three-year quest to return to the NFL to Los Angeles. His
spokesperson, Ashleigh Adams, said the possibility of acquiring the
property on Figueroa across from the Coliseum is very preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just an idea that's been floated,'' Adams said. ``It's
strictly a preliminary discussion. As of yet, no decision has been
made to even investigate the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The property under consideration has some retail, parking and
apartment buildings. A public agency could condemn the property and
then possibly offer it to a developer to build a retail and parking
complex.
