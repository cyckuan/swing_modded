</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- No modern investment firm has ever dominated the U.S. stock

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Saudi Statement on Building Friendly Ties with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran today welcomed Saudi
Arabia's statement on building amiable and friendly relations
between Tehran and Riyadh by Saudi Arabian Defense Minister
Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, said
that his country welcomed the Prince Sultan's statement, adding
that relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia "are excellent and we
are working very closely in the Organization of the Islamic
conference (OIC) on issues concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman said, "We regard cooperation between the
Islamic states to be in the interest of the Persian Gulf region."
</P>
<P>
The Saudi defense minister recently told the Arabic-language
newspaper Al-Sharaq al-Awsat that Iran and Saudi Arabia are the
two most significant Moslem countries in the region and both
would like to maintain amiable and friendly relations with each
other.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan added that despite the Shiite-Sunni differences,
the two peoples are united through their basic Islamic beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The local press also welcomed the Saudi Arabian goodwill
gesture, saying if Prince Sultan's statement in the Al-Sharaq
al-Awsat reflects Saudi Arabia's general policy, a new chapter may
be opening in Iran-Saudi relations.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts confirm that religious and cultural differences
between Tehran and Riyadh have never caused political tension
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, throughout the 17 years since the Islamic Revolution,
and despite Iran's repeated efforts to establish friendly ties
with the Saudis, Riyadh always found an excuse to rebuff Tehran's
well-intentioned approaches, the English language newspaper Iran
News said in its editorial.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Saudi leaders always looked for imaginary
excuses to go on the offensive against Iran. They went all out in
their support for Iraq when its President Saddam Hussein's
forces attacked the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
It said that Tehran is always ready to host the Saudi foreign
minister and resolve the existing differences and
misunderstanding between two countries.

<HEADLINE> Du Pont Still Holes Up in Home After Alleged Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Eccentric millionaire John
du Pont, heir to the de Pont chemical fortune, is still holed up
on his 800-acre estate in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, a day
after he allegedly shot and killed an Olympic wrestling champion.
</P>
<P>
Police negotiated via cordless telephone with him, but he
refused to surrender.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations and conversations continue," said Newtown
Township Police Lieutenant Lee Hunter. He said police had no plans
to storm the mansion.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont, 57, allegedly shot and killed Dave Schultz, a 1984
Olympic gold medalist and 1983 world champion. He worked as a
wrestling coach for du Pont's club team based at the estate and
lived there with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
Schultz, 36, was also training for a comeback at the 1996
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Police said du Pont pulled up in his car and opened fire as
Schultz was standing outside his home in the estate grounds Friday
afternoon, hitting the wrestler three times.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said police had witnesses to the shooting and declared
du Pont the only suspect. The estate, about 13 miles outside
Philadelphia, was now surrounded by a force of 75 officers.
</P>
<P>
Newtown Police Chief Michael Mallon said they knew of no motive
for the shooting, but witnesses said there was an argument before
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors described the millionaire as an eccentric. One woman
said du Pont once drove up to her house in an armored personnel
carrier and asked if her husband could "come out and play."
</P>
<P>
Residents also recalled that du Pont drove two luxury cars into
a pond on his property, one after another.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont is a great-great grandson of E.I. du Pont, who founded
 Du Pont, a giant chemical company, in 1802. The du Pont family is
estimated to be worth more than 10 billion dollars and John du
Pont's fortune was put at about 46.2 million dollars in 1985 by
his ex-wife who was then filing for divorce.

ADDIS ABABA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of he

called on Niger's coup soldiers to restore civil government at an
early date.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, led by Chief of Staff of the armed forces

for Africa, especially at a time when the continent is forging
ahead on the path of democratization," said Salim in a statement.
</P>

"The Secretary General has received the news of the military
take-over in Niger with profound regrets. He believes any

negation of the will of the people," said the statement.

Before the coup, the OAU Secretary General had made a personal
appeal to the toppled President Mahamane Ousmane and Prime
Minister Hama Amadou of Niger to solve the nation's political,

<HEADLINE> Sunken Warship to be Salvaged Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China will begin to salvage a
sunken warship of the former Kuomintang government in Yangtze
River this November.
</P>
<P>
Named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of
China, the warship is considered to be one of the vessels that has
produced the greatest historic significance in China's modern
history, for it involved in many historic events in the first half
of this century. The warship was attacked by Japanese bombers and
sank in Yangtze River on October 24, 1938.
</P>
<P>
The salvage project will cost about five million yuan or
600,000 US dollars and the expenditures for its protection,
repairing and display are estimated to reach 84 million yuan or
one million US dollars. The Hubei Province plans to set up a
foundation to collect money from domestic and overseas personnel.
</P>
<P>
The salvage will begin on November 12, the 130th anniversary of
Dr. Sun's birthday, and is scheduled to finish in February, 1997.

successful," said Wang Fei, head coach of the August First.

<HEADLINE> China Airdrops Relief to Snow-stricken People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- An airforce plane dropped eight
tons of relief supplies to herdsmen snow-stricken in the Yushu
Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in northwest China's Qinghai
Province this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The plane is from south China's Guangzhou Military Area
Command.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai is expected to send 20 tons of food, medicine, fuel and
other relief supplies to the snowstorm-hit prefecture after search
planes spotted most of the 1,141 herdsmen trapped in heavy snow
for over two weeks after months of blizzards.
</P>
<P>
The Yushu prefecture government has recently appealed the
society to donate to help the herdsmen to fight snowstorm. So far
institutions and individuals have offered money and materials
worth more than 240,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, record snowfalls have continued in the
Yushu Prefecture, causing the heaviest losses in four decades. A
total of 5,193 people suffered from frostbite and 278,000 heads of
cattle froze to death.

<HEADLINE> Syria Stresses Inseparability of Syrian, Lebanese Stances on Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A leading Syrian newspaper
today published an editorial stressing the inseparability of
Syrian and Lebanese positions on peace negotiations with Israel,
which was resumed prior to a recent Middle East tour by
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, Teshreen, maintained that the Middle East peace
process is a top priority for the Syrian-Lebanese Supreme council,
which held in Damascus Saturday a meeting co-chaired by Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, mouthpiece of the country's ruling party, said that
Syria and Lebanon are resolved that neither of them should make a
single step forward before the other as regards achieving a fair
and overall peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The announcement by Syria that it would conclude no agreement
with Israel unless such an agreement was coupled with another
agreement with Lebanon means that the peace track of Syria is
inseparable from that of Lebanon, and that no one can affect the
unified stand of the two countries," Teshreen said in the
editorial.
</P>
<P>
Teshreen emphasized that Syria would remain a real support for
Lebanon in its endeavor to liberate the Israeli-occupied south
Lebanon, and that Lebanon would also be a strong supporter for
Syria in its efforts to restore the entire Golan Heights, which
was seized by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
In the Saturday meeting, Assad stressed the importance of
further cementing the existing relationship between the two
countries, while Hrawi affirmed that his country was anxious to
continue to develop its ties with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The council will meet again today to examine its agenda and
discuss some other issues.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Flares up in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people were
killed and more than 24 others wounded when a fierce fighting
broke out in the war torn capital of Somalia, Mogadishu today.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which began early in the morning has erupted
among supporters of Ali Mahdi Mohamed of north Mogadishu and has
later spread toward the green line dividing the city where the
Murusade clan is now engaged in a bitter war with those of Abgals
supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
The fighting changed its face in mid day and turned out into a
war between the two clans -- Abgal and Murusade.
</P>
<P>
Heavy and light machine guns, recoilless rifles, mortars and
rocket propelled grenades were used during the fighting which
rages on.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is yet to be known. However,
eyewitness attributed the cause of the shoot-out as political
motivated hostility between rival Abgal militiamen, who later on
managed to divert the animosity toward their former arch enemy,
Murusade.
</P>
<P>
Stray rounds of mortars and recoilless rifles hit several
areas surrounding the over crowded main Bakara market, killing
more than 8 people and wounding 16 others.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources put the fatality to a higher number. Digfer
hospital of south Mogadishu has treated a dozen victims, while
there are many more who couldn't make it to the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families were seen fleeing the war along the green
line. The fleeing people, mainly women, children and elderly,
were carrying mattresses, household utensils and a negligible
amount of food on wheel barrow and on their heads.
</P>
<P>
No word has been made by the rival clans as the fighting seems
to be escalating later in the day. This is the heaviest armed
confrontation in Mogadishu since September last year when the two
same clans fought in Bermuda vicinity of south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The animosity between the two clans is attributed to the
political differences between their political leaders, Mr Mohamed
Qanyare Afrah of Murusade and Ali Mahdi Mohamed of Abgal. Mr
Qanyare is currently the interior minister of General Mohamed
Farah Aideed's south Mogadishu government.
</P>
<P>
Both Murusade and Abgal clans belong to the bigger tribe of
Hawiye.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority
(PA) set free a total of 16 activists of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) from prison in the Gaza Strip early this
morning, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press
service based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Among the released was Sheikh Ahmad Nimr, who was arrested
about three months ago after a Friday sermon in which he attacked
the PA and Hamas leaders who wanted to reach an reconciliation
agreement with the PA.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner release followed a meeting of the PA-Hamas
Conciliation Committee Saturday, when PLO Chairman and PA
president-elect Yasser Arafat met with a Hamas delegation for
an hour and a half in his office.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that the Conciliation Committee would meet
again the next day to discuss issues of mutual concern. The PA
asked Hamas to refrain from any actions that would embarrass the
self-rule authorities.
</P>
<P>
Arafat agreed to allow Hamas to open a public office in Gaza,
and publish an official newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed preparations for municipal
elections, tentatively scheduled for this May. It is expected
that a heated contest will take place between the PLO and
Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas delegation for Saturday's meeting comprised some
Hamas leaders, including Mahmoud Zahhar, Sayyed Abu Musameh and
Muhammad Hassan Sham'a. The PA delegation included senior
official Tayyeb Abdul Rahim, Commander of the Northern Gaza Strip
region Sa'eb Ajez, head of the Preventive Security agency Muhammad
Dahlan, acting president of the Palestine National Council Salim
Zanoun, head of Military Intelligence Musa Arafat and Gaza police
chief Ghazi Jabali.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Hockey Team Qualifies for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and India played to a
goalless draw in the Olymic hockey qualifying tournament in
Barcelona on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The draw gave the Malaysians the point they needed to clinch
the final qualifying berth for the Atlanta Olympic Games at the
expense of Canada who were playing bottom-placed Belarus later.
</P>
<P>
With India's commitment to beating Malaysia being widely
questioned, their coach Cecric Pereira told a press
conference: "If there is an iota of truth in what is being said
outside this I will resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Our performance was miserable, disgusting, disgraceful. My
players were totally unfocused."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia had packed their defence throughout the match and
India, eight times Olympic champions, rarely penetrated to their
circle.
</P>
<P>
There was just one penalty corner in the match, forced by
Malaysia's Nor Saiful in the 17th minute. His shot was
comfortably saved.
</P>
<P>
India's only assault on the Malaysia goal came when inside
left Sanjeev Kumar hit a reverse stick shot into the side-netting.
</P>
<P>
By failing to win, India faced being overtaken at the top of
the table by either Netherlands or Spain who were playing the
final match of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia joined India, Spain, Britain and the Netherlands as
qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Britain completed an unbeaten run in the qualifiers
with a 2-0 win over Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Riegler Wins World Cup Women's Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Claudia Riegler of New Zealand
won the World Cup women's Alpine skiing slalom race in
Serre-Chevalier, France on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Austra-born 19-year-old, whose mother is from New Zealand,
clocked a combined time of one minute and 31.27 seconds on the Luc
Alphand piste to emulate Anne-Lise Coberger who won a slalom in
Hinterstoder in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Pace-setter Karin Roten of Switzerland, fastest in the first
leg, missed out on her birthday present. The giant slalom junior
world champion finished second in 1:31.56.
</P>
<P>
Despite a disastrous morning leg, Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg was
third in 1:31.79.
</P>
<P>
Riegler, who dropped out of the Austrian team two seasons ago
after a row with her coaches and decided to race for New Zealand,
had already made the podium once this season, her second on the
World Cup circuit. She was third in a slalom in Maribor earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
She parted with her native country because she wanted to
concentrate on slaloms, whereas her coaches wanted her to remain
an all-rounder.
</P>
<P>
Former teammate Effi Eder won the slalom World Cup despite
finishing a disappointing 11th on Sunday. With only one race
left, the Austrian leads her nearest rival, Slovenia's Urska
Hrovat, by nearly 200 points.
</P>
<P>
The race looked set to go Roten's way after the young Swiss,
who celebrated her 20th birthday on Saturday, clocked the fastest
time of the first leg.
</P>
<P>
But she was far too tense in the second run and had to settle
for the second runner-up spot of her career after taking second
place in Semmering last month.
</P>
<P>
A disappointing 11th in the morning run, Wiberg, the combined
Olympic champion, reacted by winning the second leg in
swashbuckling fashion but had to settle for third spot overall.
</P>
<P>
But the experienced Swede, winner of two slaloms this season,
in Veysonnaz and Semmering, remains a strong favourite for the
world championships in Sierra Nevada next month.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Propaganda officials at all
levels must work with stronger enthusiasm and initiative in
contributing to the construction of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, urged Ding Quangen, a politburo member of the
central committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
"We must resolutely uphold Deng Xiaoping's theory as the basic
guideline in our work and keep uniform with the CPC Central
Committee , with comrade Jiang zemin as the nucleus," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ding called on the propaganda officials to take the economic
construction as the whole country's central task.
</P>
<P>
While urging cadres working in the ideological field to study
hard and raise their theoretical levels, Ding said that they
should often go to the grassroot to mix with the masses and do
investigation and research.
</P>
<P>
"All we are doing is for the people," he said, adding that "we
should keep the masses in our hearts and serve them
whole-heartedly."

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Emma George of Australia broke
the world women's pole vault record twice in the Perth leg of the
Australian Grand Prix athletics series on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
George, 21, a former sprinter, cleared 4.30 meters to better
the previous record of 4.28 set by herself last month.
</P>
<P>
George, plagued with an arm injury though, then established
another new record for the second time with a clearance of 4.41
meters.
</P>
<P>
But she failed when the bar rose to 4.50 meters and gave up her
try to protect her arm.
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to jump at least 4.20 meters today because, at
my past couple of meets, I've been inconsistent and not moving up
my poles correctly," said George.
</P>
<P>
"I strained my arm in Adelaide on Friday and decided to rest
it after I missed at 4.50 meters because I'm competing here in
Perth again next week and at an indoor meet in Japan in two
weeks' time," she said.
</P>
<P>
The women's pole vault will not be contested at the Atlanta
Olympics of this year but will be on the program for the 1997
world indoor championships.

BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- All-China Federation of Trade
Unions, All-China Youth Federation and All-China Women's
Federation have all congratulated the establishment of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
They said that they are confident that the members of the

<P>
In order to ensure the smooth transfer of power and the stable
transition of Hong Kong and keep the contingent of Hong Kong civil
servants stable, he said, his organization would make greater
efforts to strengthen its relations with trade unions of Hong Kong
civil servants.
</P>
<P>

interview with Xinhua that the federation would organize a series
of activities to acquaint young people both in the interior and
Hong Kong with history about how Hong Kong became a colony.

sides would be mainly aimed at maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity
and stability after China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong and promoting the publicity of the Basic Law and
the implementation of the principle of "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Supervision Called For To Combat Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Sixth Plenary Session of
the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) has reviewed the
anti-corruption campaigns last year, and worked out a plan to
further the drive for this year, said an editorial carried on the
frontpage of today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, with the title of "Strengthen Supervision Within
the Party, Deepen the Anti-Corruption Drive", said that an
important speech made by the Party's General Secretary Jiang Zemin
two days ago expounded the great significance of stepping up Party
building and reenforcing the supervision mechanism within the
Party.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the CPC has always attached great
importance to promoting honesty among Party members and fighting
against corruption. To help the Party members especially the
leading cadres to heighten their awareness of corruption is
crucial to the reenforcement of supervision within the Party.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stressed that the key part of this endeavor lies
in the supervision of cadres, especially senior ones. "The greater
a cadre's authority and responsibility, stricter supervision on
him."
</P>
<P>
The editorial concluded that all Party members and party
organizations at all levels will fulfil the anti-corruption tasks
and contribute to the realization of the Ninth-Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000), under the leadership of the CPC Central
Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania ought to
develop a self-supporting economy to avoid foreign aid
humiliation, president Benjamin Mkapa has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing tanzanian nationals living in Uganda at the
residence of Tanzanian High Commissioner in Kampala on Friday,
Mkapa said Tanzania should build the economy that spared it from
harassment by donor countries and brought about equality and
respect.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted him as saying the government was
recently obliged to take immediate measures to place the
mini-budget to plug a deficit because of donor countries'
reluctance to come to the assistance.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa went to Uganda to discuss with his
counterpart, president Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Kenyan
president Arap moi the revival of East African cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"However, there are on-going efforts to raise revenue through
tax collection and strict control of expenditure so that the
latter balances with income," Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said after the multi-party elections
every Tanzanian had the obligation to accept the results
announced by the National Electoral Commission on the mainland or
that in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
"Rejecting the results is in violation of the very law that
every party had recognized when it agreed to participate in the
elections, even honorable countries accept this reality," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa further said one of the tasks of the government was to
enlighten Tanzanians on multi-partism, under which after the
election results all the people united to build their nation
instead of scheming to disown the elected leadership or
prohibiting the government to carry out its national building
work.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa later left for Baturite in Zaire to meet
President Mobutu Sese Seko for discussion on the situation of the
Rwandan and Burundi refugees.
</P>
<P>
The president and his entourage are due back in Dar Es Salaam
today.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at the Cyprus
Institute of Neurology and Genetics have discovered a new form of
Cystic fibrosis, which is unique to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey carried out by Dr. Constantinos Deltas
and a team of molecular biologists, the new strain is more common
in two villages in the south of the island, Cyprus Mail reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Milder symptoms are presented by the new form, which may have
led to misdiagnosis in the past, Dr. Deltas was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years scientists have analyzed the genetic
material of patients suffering from the inherited disease cystic
fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
In three patients from three different Cypriot families, this
analysis led to the discovery of two new patterns in the genetic

<P>
The team now believes there is one pattern found only in
Cyprus which causes a milder form of cystic fibrosis which has
often been misdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
Cystic fibrosis is one of the most serious diseases affecting
the worldwide white population. It can be passed on to a child
when both parents are carriers.
</P>
<P>
The main symptoms include breathing infections and problems
with the pancreas and gastric system.
</P>
<P>
The team's survey has revealed that in two southern villages
of Cyprus there is a larger population of carriers, which means
intermarriage of villagers can lead to a greater risk of a child
developing the disease.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Move to Center Stage of Global Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is expected to
move to the center stage of the world economy as it continues to
pursue sound macroeconomic policies.
</P>
<P>
This was the optimistic assessment made by David Nellor, the
International Monetary Fund's resident representative to the
country, last week before a joint session of the European Chamber
of Commerce and Philexport Cebu.
</P>
<P>
He cited a few indications which he said signifies the opening
up of the Philippine economy and which parallel the developments
of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, foreign direct and portfolio
investments have increased dramatically. Total capital flows
amounted to over two billion US dollars in 1995 compared to less
than 500 million US dollars at the beginning of the decade.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the decade, equity market capitalization
has increased many times. Even in relation to the gross national
product (GNP), stock market capitalization increased by over five
times to about 75 percent of the GNP in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, foreign exchange trading volumes have
increased by almost 20 times.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the decade, merchandise trade has more
than doubled with an increase in importance in relations to the
GNP.
</P>
<P>
Nellor indicated that globalization is the vehicle that can
deliver both the economic and social objectives of Philippines
2000.
</P>
<P>
He said that access to international capital markets allows
higher levels of investment at lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Low trade barriers worldwide allows firms to readily find
markets abroad, while reducing costs to consumers at home, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that there is also a downside to
globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said that "vastly increased financial flows across national
borders have made countries that participate in international
financial markets more vulnerable to adverse shifts in market
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Such shifts, he noted, can often be sudden, massive and
destabilizing.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he urged the Philippines to build a foundation for
transforming the present economic recovery into a period of high
and sustained economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Military Govt Opens Talks with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Officials said today they
"will not comment" on a claim by weekly "Expo Times" that "closed
door talks (between the Revolutionary United Front (ruf) and the
government) to end the rebel war began in Freetown Friday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly, quoting reliable sources, said the ruf mission is
led by Mohamed Saccoh and includes Brima Kamara, Ibrahim Turay
and Allieu Kelfala, all graduates from the Njala University
College (nuc) in Moyamba, south of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nuc was twice attacked by rebels forcing the institution to
close for a year and has now resumed clasess in a temporary
location in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here say that the main core of the ruf is made up of
conscripted graduates from nuc abducted by the ruf in a series
of attacks throughout the country. Many of the students were on
holidays in various parts of the country when they were abducted,
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly, "the delegates said at the meeting
that they were sent to spearhead peace talks because of the ruf's
struggle for democracy."
</P>
<P>
"They also informed head of state, Brigadier General Maada Bio
that the ruf leader, Foday Sankoh is not interested in a central
government post but prefers to head a council of all paramount
chiefs," the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said the claim contradicts earlier
statements attributed to Sankoh in which he said he wants nothing
short of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The ruf delegates, the weekly said, "assured the government
that the war is ended if there is sincerity about negotiating
peace and agrees to defer the elections for the time being."
</P>
<P>
The weekly did not give the names of those representing the
government nor the duration of the talks, but diplomats said here
today that "some level of discussions are going on."
</P>
<P>
One hotel staff in an interview said, "four important looking
guests escorted by high-level government officials were brought
to the seaside hotel late Thursday. They are taking their meals
separately from other guests and keeping much more to
themselves," she added.
</P>
<P>
Expo Times said the four men were airlifted to the defence
headquarters here from Panguma in the east on Thursday where
Sankoh is reportedly based.
</P>
<P>
Correspondents here said government officials "are tight
lipped" over the affair in order not to jeopardise any result
from the talks.
</P>
<P>
No attack has been reported so far on either civilian or
military targets in any part of the country since the ceasefire
was announced five days ago. The ceasefire expires next Wednesday
and it is likely to be extended, observers said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, nominations for presidential
candidates were extended to Monday, elections officials said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday was previously designated "nomination day" but
only seven of the 15 political parties filed in candidates. Four
of the seven filed in joint candidates.
</P>
<P>
Among the presidential contestants are former foreign
secretary Dr Abass Bundu, running for the People's Progressive
Party (ppp), former secretary of state for finance in the
military government Dr John Karimu for the National Unity Party
while a merger between the National Democratic Alliance and the
Democratic Centre Party filed a single candidate and the National
Alliance Democratic Party filed in a single candidate with the
only woman in the race, Mrs Jeredine Sarho as running mate.
</P>
<P>
The government owned Sierra Leone Radio and Television
announced today that it has now extended its facilities to all
the registered parties for political campaigns and broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
Opposition political parties have not been allowed access to
the government run radio and tv since the early 70s when Sierra
Leone became a one party state.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN to Harmonize Standards for Professionals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN economic officials are
negotiating a set of common standards and qualifications for
professionals in line with the general goal of achieving free
trade in services.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Trade Secretary Edsef Custodio said over the weekend,
"We want to ensure the mobility of skilled workers and other
professionals and that they are given adequate protection."
</P>
<P>
Under the new services agreement, endorsed by leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) during last
December's summit, member countries vowed to open up seven
priority areas no later than January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and the Philippines have proposed further talks on
how standards, qualifications and accreditation requirements could
be harmonized.
</P>
<P>
Custodio, who leads the Philippine Panel in the negotiations,
said officials have agreed to grant concessions that are more
favorable than those provided in the General Agreement on Trade in
Services (GATS) implemented by the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Special commitments will be negotiated on such matters as
professional qualifications, standards and licensing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on financial services, telecommunications and
tourism are to be completed by June 30, 1997, and talks on
maritime transport, air transport, construction and business
services by December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate the negotiations, ASEAN officials agreed to
conduct talks on a bilateral or plurilateral basis. Sectoral
negotiating groups will also be formed to deal with specific
issues.
</P>
<P>
Of the ASEAN members, the Philippines has the highest number of
workers overseas.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials estimate that Filipino overseas contract
workers now number some six million and remit some three billion
US dollars to their families each year.
</P>
<P>
Except for Brunei, the services sector contributes the largest
share to the gross domestic product in ASEAN since 1960.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Singapore, services account for about 63 percent
of the GDP, the highest in the region.

<HEADLINE> Work on Thai-Laotian Rail Link Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Work on the first-ever rail
link between Thailand and Laos has started, according to a report
from Nong Khai, northeast Thailand, today.
</P>
<P>
The rail link is about 30 kilometers long, linking Thailand's
northeastern city of Nong Khai and the Laotian capital of
Vientiane across the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, which was built
with Australian fund and completed in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
The rail link, to be completed in eight months, will be the
first section of railroad the land-locked Laos will ever have.
</P>
<P>
The rail link will greatly facilitate cargo transport and
tourism between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study on the second phase of the project is under
way by Balfour Beatty, a British firm, for a 1,400 kilometer line
running north through Laos to the Chinese border.
</P>
<P>
The rail link over the Mekong river is a crucial link in a
proposed Asian railroad network which will eventually link
Singapore, through Malaysia, Thailand and China up to South Korea,
or through Mongolia up to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Ceremonies marking the beginning of the construction of the
rail link were held Saturday on both banks of the Mekong river
Saturday.

MANILA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said today that the anti-terrorism bill and other strong measures

Ramos gave his personal assurance to his predecessor Corazon
Aquino during an informal conversation in Aquino's home province

multinational firms.

"It's all media hype," Ramos said. "Why should I declare
martial law when I, myself, played part in the restoration of
democracy 10 years ago?"
</P>
<P>
Aquino assured Ramos of her continued support for the country's
effort to achieve enduring peace and sustained prosperity.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A Bainqen Master Painter held
an exhibition of Tangka, the Tibetan word for painting, here today
at the China Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Chinese Association for Cultural Exchanges
with Foreign Countries, the exhibition featured 40 pieces of
Tangka painted by Nyima Cering, a Tibetan artist who was granted
the title of "Bainqen Master Painter" by the late 10th Bainqen
Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain (1938-1989).
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering was just back from an extensive exhibition tour of
India, Austria, Switzerland and Spain, which lasted from September
to December, 1995. His paintings were warmly welcomed.
</P>
<P>
Nyima Cering, born in 1944 in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, graduated from the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts in
1962. The late 10th Bainqen spoke highly of his achievements in
art and granted him the title of "Bainqen Master Painter".
</P>

The artist has not only carried out the characteristics of the
traditional Tibetan paintings, but also creatively applied modern
painting techniques to give new spirits to ancient Tangka and

<HEADLINE> ITF No Comment on Positive Drugs Tests Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Tennis
Federation (ITF), world governing body of the sport, refused on
Sunday to confirm a British media report that two leading players
had tested positive for cocaine at a grand slam event.
</P>
<P>
The report by the News of the World alleged that former world
number one Mats Wilander and Czech Karel Novacek had tested
positive at last year's French Open.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Wilander and Novacek had denied taking
drugs and hired leading international lawyers in a bid to clear
their names.
</P>
<P>
While ITF president Brian Tobin refused to confirm the report,
he told a news conference on the last day of the Australian Open
in Melbourne: "If there were no positive tests, the lawyers
wouldn't be talking to anybody, would they?"
</P>
<P>
Wilander, who has won seven grand slams, last year finished in
the top 50 for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"We don't comment on any individual tests or results," said
Tobin.
</P>
<P>
"The ITF won't be making any comment on this story until or
unless there is an outcome which requires a penalty."
</P>
<P>
"It's unfair to any athlete to comment until they've had an
opportunity to clear themselves or not clear themselves."
</P>
<P>
Tobin said there was an ITF appeal process which was handled
by an independent appeals board.
</P>
<P>
The News of the World said Wilander and Novacek would refute
the authenticity of the tests and the way they were carried out
at a laboratory in France.
</P>
<P>
Neither Wilander, world number one in 1988, nor Novacek,
holder of 13 titles and a former world number eight, played in
the year's first grand slam event in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The News of the World said they pulled out of the event
claiming they were injured and flew to London with their lawyers
for talks with the ITF and the Association of Tennis
Professionals (ATP).

LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Tennis stars Mats Wilander and
Czechoslovakia's Karel Novacek were both accused of failing drug
test at last year's French Open, according to a local newspaper
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The News of the World claims the two players tested positive
for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Wilander and Novacek are engaged in an
intense legal battle against the International Tennis Federation
and the Association of Tennis Professionals, the sport's governing
bodies, to have the test results dismissed.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper carried what it said was a statement from the
players' American lawyer which confirmed they were fighting the
charges.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of our clients we categorically deny the
allegations. We have lie detector evidence proving our clients
are telling the truth in denying the allegation.
</P>
<P>
"We are issuing proceedings against the ITF in the High Court
in London next week. A more complete statement will be issued by
our clients in due course," said the statement.
</P>

The 32-year-old Wilander, who became the youngest player ever
to win a grand slam event when he won the 1982 French Open, and
Novacek pulled out shortly before the start of the Austalian Open

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Devotes Great Efforts to Jute Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has made great efforts
to conduct the research on jute with an aim to diversify
production to boost exports of the product, President Abdur
Rahman Biswas said today.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the first ever international workshop on jute and
the environment here, the president said various research
organizations are engaged in the research, development and
innovation of non-traditional jute products.
</P>
<P>
These include the Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, the
Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and the
Diversified Fabric Plant of the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Their recent efforts towards diversification include production
of jute carpets, use of jute geo-textiles in roads and
embankments, production of paper and pulp from low grade jute
cuttings and green jute plants, and use of jute reinforced plastic
for manufacturing various items, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Jute occupies a vital position in Bangladesh's socio-economic
life, as the jute industry contributes about 12 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) and accounts for about 12
percent of the total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
There are 64 jute mills operating in Bangladesh, making the
industry one of the biggest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Describing jute as an environment friendly and golden fibre,
the president noted that the government is implementing a project
to restructure the jute industry as it faces serious constraints
due to falls in external demand.

<HEADLINE> Seles to Take Part in Pan Pacific Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles will take part in
the 926,250-U.S. dollar Toray Pan Pacific Open tennis tournament
which will be held in Tokyo this week.
</P>
<P>
The world co-number one, who suffered her only defeat since her
comeback at the hands of her arch rival Steffi Graf at the
U.S. Open last year, captured her ninth Grand Slam title at the
Australian Open on Saturday in the absence of Graf.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who beat Seles at the U.S. Open final in September, will
also be absent from the Tokyo event, giving Seles a bigger chance
to stretch her winning streak this season, following her victories
at Sydney and Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who became a US citizen in March 1994, came back into
action in an exhibition in July last year after being stabbed in
the back by a deranged Graf fan in a tournament in Hamburg in
April 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Graf, the winner in Tokyo in 1986, 1990 and 1994,
withdrew from this year's indoor event, one of the biggest
tournaments other than the Grand Slam matches, following surgery
on December 15 to remove bone splinters from her left foot.
</P>
<P>
Seles' major rivals for the Tokyo trophy include Spaniards
Conchita Martinez, the 1994 Wimbledon champion, and Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, Japanese tennis queen and defending champion
Kimiko Date, and Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria.

<HEADLINE> China Seizes 925 Foreign Falcon Poachers, Smugglers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese forest policemen have
seized 925 falcon poachers in northwest China, rescuing more than
400 of the rare birds from the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the poachers travelled to China from a neighbouring
country using tourist or business visas, said officials.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ping, a forest police officer with the Ministry of
Forestry, said, "about 40 of the poachers were detained for
further investigation." The number of those seized excludes
figures from other customs and other departments.
</P>
<P>
"A growing number of poachers, mainly from the same
neighbouring country, flocked to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, Qinghai Province and other regions with visa for tourism
or business, but entered restricted areas or nature reserves to
hunt falcons", Zhang said in an interview with Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The poachers used nets to capture falcons under the protection
of the Chinese government. Some killed smaller birds they did not
need on the spot, She said.
</P>
<P>
According to investigations by forest police in Xinjiang, an
organized international wildlife smuggling gang involved in the
poaching. Without any Chinese permission, some citizens from the
country entered border areas that are not opened to foreigners or
nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
The number of falcon poaching gangs increased to several
hundred last year from only several a few years ago, according to
the investigation results.
</P>
<P>
"Several years ago, only a border port was used to smuggle out
falcons, now the smugglers often use Urumqi and Beijing airport
ports as their exit channels".
</P>
<P>
Some smugglers stitched up the eyelids of falcons or
anaesthetized them when they were smuggled. Some smuggled falcons
were found in TV sets or tape recorders, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Some falcons could not survive the journey. Falcons smuggled
out of China are transported to Middle East markets, where a
falcon is usually sold at a price between 20,000 and 50,000 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The forest police in Xinjiang - also known as wardens- launched
a three-month campaign last year to crack down on the rampant
poaching and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
About 600 poachers and smugglers were seized and 237 falcons
were intercepted by the police during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
To stem the falcon poaching, Zhang Ping said laws on rare
wildlife poaching should be improved and port control tightened so
that more poachers and smugglers will receive the punishment they
deserve.

Similar with the land force, the navy in the military forces to
be stationed in the Hong Kong SAR is also of meritorious war
records. Its Pioneer No.1 gunboat set the first bravery example of
the navy in the Wanshan Sea Battle, and in 1965 it became the
first to sink a big enemy warship. Lately the navy has
successfully completed patroling in waters near the Nansha and
Xisha islands, and the Beibu Gulf and major maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
"The Eagle In the Blue Sky" is what people termed one regiment
of the air force in the PLA unit. Commended by several top Chinese
leaders including Deng Xiaoping, the regiment has taken part in
battles and patrols defending the country's air territory and in
rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
With the glorious records, the young officers and soldiers of
the forces have embarked on the journey for future achievements.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demands of the new posts in the Hong Kong SAR, the
naval vessels troops have organized officers and soldiers to study
Hong Kong's geographical and hydrometeorological environments, and
carried out training programs focusing on emergency launch,
offshore rescue, and people and goods delivery.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at meeting the flight standards of the world's best, the
air force has carried out training programs focusing on landing on
hilltops, city mobile patroling and some other tactical subjects.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, an examination on training 129 items was
held to test the forces founded for barely three years. And the
result, 99.2 percent were excellent.
</P>
<P>
The military forces to be stationed in Hong Kong are well
chosen with their political awareness and professional skills
having to meet certain standards and requirements.
</P>
<P>
With such highly qualified soldiers, Major General Liu Zhenwu,
the commander of the military forces to be stationed in Hong Kong,
said confidently, "we will achieve the lofty mission entrusted on
us by China's 1.2 billion people, including the Hong Kong
compatriots."

SHENZHEN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen months away from
China's resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong
Kong in mid-1997, the military forces of Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) to be stationed in Hong Kong has been formed
in Shenzhen City in south China.
</P>
<P>
The forces, consisting of the PLA ground, naval and air
forces, will enter Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 and be responsible for
the defence of the special administrative region, as a symbol
of China's resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
As representatives of the Chinese military forces sent to the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) by the central
government, this PLA unit has take much pains in molding the
graces and skills of its soldiers and officers since it started to
be formed at the beginning of 1993.
</P>
<P>
To better prepare for their new posts, the soldiers and
officers of the military forces have been demanded to learn the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR and Hong Kong's laws concerning
military forces currently in effect, and follow a set of moral and
behavior codes just formulated.
</P>
<P>
And soldiers who serve as motor vehicle drivers have to take
training courses on roads with traffic conditions similar to Hong
Kong and pass examinations before they are dispatched to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
With the strict disciplines, the forces reported no case of
serious breach of disciplines in 182 unexpected inspections by
higher military authorities.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the military forces, Li Youwei, secretary of the
Party committee of Shenzhen, said, "Forces like this are bound to
act as an important guarantee for Hong Kong's stability and
prosperity after they are stationed in the Hong Kong, and is bound
to win support from local residents."
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Colonel Chen Weizhan, who is in charge of trainings
in the forces, said that all the companies in the land force has
scored high marks in several training programs such as the five-km

<HEADLINE> Military Forces in HK SAR To Be Administered Strictly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The military forces of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be stationed in the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will be controlled in a
closed-door manner and there will be no conflicts of interests
between the forces and the local civilians, said a high-ranking
military officer here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhenwu, commander of the PLA military forces to be
stationed in the Hong Kong SAR, said that at present some people
in Hong Kong are worried that the military forces will engage in
production and business activities after being stationed in Hong
Kong and will not abide by laws and observe discipline.
</P>
<P>
"Such worries are completely unnecessary," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He said the character and purpose of the PLA have decided that
the military forces serve the people whole-heartedly. The PLA has
made great contributions to the people in both war time and peace
time. In the peace time, he said, the PLA has always undertaken
the urgent, dangerous and heavy tasks. They worked in the van in
relief efforts in such cases as the disastrous earthquake in
Tangshan, the major forest fire in Daxing'anling Mountains and the
flood in south China.
</P>
<P>
Though the military forces to be stationed in Hong Kong SAR was
organized not long ago, they have already given full support to
the local work in Shenzhen such as dredging rivers and planting
trees on mountains, he said.
</P>
<P>
So long as the overwhelming majority of the people are
acquainted with the character and purpose of the armed forces
and have a true understanding of the forces, the misunderstandings
will be cleared up, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the Central Military Commission has stipulated that
the military units under the group army level cannot engage in
production and businesses. "The military forces to be stationed in
Hong Kong has not engaged in such activities in the course of
being organized, neither will they do so after being stationed in
the Hong Kong SAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the military forces will be supported financially by
the central government. After the forces are stationed in the Hong
Kong SAR, the acts of the forces will be standardized by relevant
regulations of the PLA, and relevant laws, regulations and rules
will also be made according to the actual situation and the
characteristics of the stationed forces as well as the Basic Law
for the Hong Kong SAR and relevent laws in a bid to control the
military forces stationed in the Hong Kong SAR strictly in
accordance with law.
</P>
<P>
By controlling the forces in a closed-door manner, which has
been universally practiced by the PLA on the mainland, officers
and soldiers are not allowed to go out at will, he said. The
military forces may leave the camps only on official duties and in
an organized manner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the officers and soldiers of the military
forces will further study relevant policies of the central
government on the Hong Kong issue as well as the laws in Hong
Kong, get to know more about the life and social customs of the
Hong Kong people and enhance their adaptability after being
stationed in the Hong Kong SAR.

<HEADLINE> Bouchard Vows to Get Quebec Out of Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Lucien Bouchard, the new leader
of the separatist Parti Quebecois, today vowed to carry on the
battle for Quebec independence from Canada.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard, who took over the leadership at the Special National
Council of the party in Montreal, will be sworn in as Quebec
premier to replace Jacques Parizeau, who announced resignation
after the separatists' defeat in the referendum on Quebec
independence last October.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard told secessionists at the council that Quebec
sovereignty is an available reality and he will achieve it.
</P>
<P>
However, his short-term priority is the economy, he said. "We
can not and we must not tolerate the poverty and the
unemployment," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He will plan an economic summit of political, business and
labor leaders soon after he takes office, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard's efforts to improve Quebec's economy will put
separatists in a better position to resume their drive toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
"Once we have re-established the finance of Quebec on a solid
basis we will be able to do anything we want collectively," he
said earlier.
</P>
<P>
"If we decide it's sovereignty, it's sovereignty and we'll
succeed," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien brought a number of federalist
elite, especially Stephane Dion, into the national unity team in
the cabinet shuffle two days ago.
</P>
<P>
Dion, who was appointed as the intergovernmental affairs
minister, said in an interview after his appointment that if
Quebec can separate from Canada, then natives and municipalities
can separate from Quebec.
</P>
<P>
"You can't consider Canada divisible but the territory of
Quebec sacred," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bouchard made an angry response at a press conference following
his takeover. He said "the existing current territory of Quebec
belongs to Quebec and will be never, never partitioned."
</P>
<P>
When asked if Canada is divisible why not Quebec too, Bouchard
noted that Canada is divisible because it is not a real country,
saying "There are two peoples, two nations and two territories and
this one is ours."
</P>
<P>
"In Quebec, we are a people and we are a nation. As a nation,
we have a fundamental right to keep, maintain and protect our
territory," he added.

<HEADLINE> PLA HK Military Forces Smaller Than British HK Forces, Says Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The size of the military
forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be
stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
will be smaller than that of the British forces now in Hong Kong,
said a military commander here today.
</P>
<P>
Major General Liu Zhenwu, commander of the PLA Military Forces
to be stationed in the Hong Kong SAR, said the forces are made up
of the PLA ground, naval and air forces to reflect China's
territory, territorial waters and air sovereignty over the Hong
Kong region.
</P>
<P>
The major general said the PLA military forces will be
stationed in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 and will be responsible for
the defence affairs of the Hong Kong SAR in accordance with the
relevant stipulation in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the military forces will not interfere in the
local affairs of the SAR. The government of the Hong Kong SAR may,
when necessary, ask the Central People's Government for assistance
from the forces in the maintenance of the public order and in
disaster relief, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, the main body of the ground
force to be stationed in Hong Kong SAR is "the First Regiment of
the Red Army" established in the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by
Mao Zedong in 1927. It is the army that fostered more than 100
high-ranking generals including Luo Ronghuan, Su Yu, Tang Zheng
and Yang Dezhi. After the founding of the People's Republic, the
army took part in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
(1950-1953) and other military operations and built brilliant
feats.
</P>
<P>
The navy force to be stationed in the Hong Kong SAR was
originally a submarine chasers brigade established in 1959. The
troop took part in the first navy battle for China's naval force
and successfully accomplished a number of military services and
major exercises in Nansha, Xisha, Beibu Gulf in the South China
Sea.
</P>
<P>
the predecessor of the air force to be stationed in the Hong
Kong SAR, military sources said, took part in a number of major
military actions such as the battle to defend the Xisha Isles and
completed a number of air tasks for missile and satellite launches
for the purpose of military scientific research. The air force
also flew special planes for late Premier Zhou Enlai and retired
senior leader Deng Xiaoping and made outstanding contributions to
helping earthquake victims and fighting floods, fires and other
disasters.

<P>
SHENZHEN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Military Forces
to be stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) are well chosen from the Chinese People's Liberation Army
(PLA), with most officers having received regular training in
military colleges and soldiers all having finished senior middle
school.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Niu Yiyang, a soldier of the
seventh company, introduced himself calmly in Cantonese and
English.
</P>
<P>
Niu, 19, joined the army from a rural village in east China's
Anhui Province after finishing senior middle school. He won a
first-class prize in an essay contest in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers like Niu Yiyang are large in number in the military
forces to be stationed in the Hong Kong SAR. Of the 200 officers
and men in a communications station, 80 percent of them can speak
English and 60 percent are capable of operating computers.
</P>
<P>
In order to create a good studying environment, libraries and
reading-rooms with plenty of books, magazines and newspapers have
been established in every battalion.
</P>
<P>
"reading has become an important part of our daily life," said
Li Shijun, a soldier from Hunan Province.

<HEADLINE> Khamenei Tries to Prevent Catastrophe in Political Dispute (Part II) (By Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition daily, Salam, reported last Thursday that
Rafsanjani and his cabinet met with Khamenei last Wednesday
night. However, the daily did not reveal the subject of the
discussion between Iran's Supreme Leader and the government.
</P>
<P>
An informed source told Xinhua that Khamenei's statement came
as a result of "plenty behind-door negotiation between him and
Rafsanjani."
</P>
<P>
"Last Thursday, Iranian TV announced that Khamenei would lead
Tehran's Friday prayer. But someone else led the prayer. Had
Khamenei attended the prayer, he would have to address the
issue," the source added.
</P>
<P>
"The fight between the government and the parliament is the
talk of the town. So, as a leader, he would have to talk about
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The source added that on last Friday, Khamenei and Rafsanjani's
administration were involved in finding a way to resolve the
existing difference. The tension among the government and the
parliament reached its highest visible form as government's
advertisement for the elections were vandalized by SCC
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
Bahman, a liberal pro-Rafsanjani weekly, printed Saturday a
picture of a government advertisement for the elections. The
words "No to Liberals" were sprayed on the advertisement board.
</P>
<P>
An observer, who was unwilling to disclose his name, said that
Khamenei's statement would ease the tension temporarily.
</P>
<P>
"As a leader, Khamenei recognized that if he intervenes too
late, it might be too late to call the two factions to calm," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The observer said Rafsanjani's statement of impartiality,
made Saturday night in his meeting with a group of high-ranking
managers, was a sign that a deal was struck between Khamenei and
Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, Rafsanjani had said that the SCC was to be
blamed for not responding to rapprochement by the government.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio today quoted Rafsanjani as saying that "I plan to
remain neutral. I will only express my preference with my votes
and I expect all government officials to do the same."
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily, Iran, an official organ of the government,
quoted Rafsanjani as saying that the elections had to be held free
from any sensationalism.
</P>
<P>
"The election campaigns should continue based on healthy
rivalry," Rafsanjani said.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be appropriate to insult and make unfounded
allegations during the campaigns," he added.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei broke silence on fierce power struggle, calling for calm
and opposing any tension in the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
"In these times when our valiant nation is preparing to
participate in the elections, we are all duty-bound to avoid
whatever may cause enmity and tension," Khamenei said in a
statement carried by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's statement came in reaction to a letter written by a
group of top officials who had asked him to intervene to dispel
the misunderstanding created between them and a group of
Parliament members.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Khamenei's response to the letter
does not mean he supports the senior government officials backed
by President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
What Khamenei did is to try to prevent a big catastrophe
caused by the intensified power struggle between the liberal
camps headed by President Rafsanjani and the conservative camp
headed by Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 top members of the administration of President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, issued a statement on January 18, calling for
wider participation by all groups in the upcoming March 8th
parliamentary elections and opposition to monopoly of certain
group in the Parliament elections slated for March 8.
</P>
<P>
The statement drew harsh reactions from the conservatives,
namely, the Society of the Combatant Clergy (SCC), who control
the Iranian parliament.
</P>
<P>
On January 22, a group of parliament members said to be
totaling 150, issued a statement, attacking the top government
officials for insulting the Parliament and asking for an apology
to the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
They even threatened to impeach President Rafsanjani and his
cabinet members if they continue to interfere the legislative
branch.
</P>
<P>
The key problem of the power struggle stems from nomination of
candidates for the fifth Parliament elections, which would play a
definitely important role in the next presidential elections
scheduled for June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the power struggle of the two factions reached an extent
that they have to fight it out.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei's statement, however, said that the statement by the
top officials, known as G-16, was no affront to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Emphasizing the achievement of particular term of the
Parliament is not considered an insult to the current legislative
body or the following terms of the Legislature," said Khamenei's
statement.

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Act to Prevent Sea Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Gulf Countries including
Arabs and Iran are acting to prevent sea water pollution, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait-based regional Organization for the Protection of
Marine Environment, ROPME, has decided to build tanker reception
facilities in the Straits of Hormuz following a surge in
waster-dumping incidents which threaten marine life and is
polluting the long coastline.
</P>
<P>
According to the papers, the decision was made last week in
Muscat by members of the ROPME, including Iran and the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which was a member, has been suspended since the 1990-91
Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate more than 1 million barrels of crude is
dumped into the shallow Gulf waters every year, making it one of
the world's most polluted seas.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30,000 vessels enter the strategic straits of Hormuz on
the mouth of the Gulf every year to transport crude and other
goods to and from the oil-rich region.
</P>
<P>
Oman and the UAE have introduced heavy fines against
violators, who will be fined up to 2.6 million U.S. dollars in
Oman and 136,000 dollars in the UAE.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Women's Downhill Race in Italy Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The women's World Cup downhill
race at Sestriere of Italy was cancelled after skiers protested
for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Organizers decided to give up the sixth downhill race of the
season on Saturday after defending champion Picabo Street led the
protest, complaining about the safety of the Kandahar-Banchetta
track.
</P>
<P>
Street, the World Cup downhill champion of the United States,
practiced for only 20 seconds and stopped to consult with the race
officials.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 12 skiers missed a difficult gate following a bump
and "It was impossible not to miss that gate. It simply was in the
wrong place," said Canadian Kate Pace, defending World downhill
champion.
</P>
<P>
Street explained that the course was dangerous because of soft
parts and fresh snow accumulated at the sides of the track.
</P>
<P>
World Cup officials failed to say whether the race would be
rescheduled in another venue, while the men's race was rescheduled
in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany next Friday.
</P>
<P>
The next women's downhill is scheduled in Val D'Isere the next
weekend.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The formation of the military
forces of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to be stationed in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) by China's
Central People's Government has been completed after full
preparations.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the State Council and the Central
Military Commission of the People's Republic of China here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the military forces have been formed
in accordance with the PLA missions stipulated in the
Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and the relevant
stipulation of the Basic Law for the Hong Kong SAR that the
Central People's Government shall be responsible for the defence
of the Hong Kong SAR, in a bid to safeguard the state sovereignty,
reunification and territorial integrity and maintain the
prosperity and stability of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
The military forces, which are made up of PLA ground, naval and

<HEADLINE> German Becker Wins Australian Open Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 28 (Xinhua/OANA) -- German Boris Becker
defeated American Michael Chang 3-1 to win the men's singles title
at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Becker routed Chang 6-2, 6-4, 2-6 and 6-2 to seal the final
match in two hours and 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for Becker to win the Grand Slam
tournament after his first crown achieved in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Becker, 1.9 meters in height, enjoyed his upperhands against
his 1.75-meter opponent and dominated most of the match in the
center court.
</P>
<P>
Instead of hitting the ball from the baseline as usual, Becker
rushed towards the net as much as he could to block the shots from
the swift-moving Chang. And his tactics proved to be lethal with
sharp-angled drops against Chang.
</P>
<P>
Chang spent most of his time running across the court, refusing
to surrender any single point in his quest of the championship.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Becker outweighed Chang with his powerful serves, forcing
Chang to stand meters behind the baseline, before his bullets of
piercing and cross-court shots.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Chang had played his game with wisdom.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first set, Chang regained his composion with
many aces for a 4-4 tie in the second set before his ninth game
was broken by Becker.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 0-2, Chang changed his rhythm to keep Becker at the
baseline with flat volleys in the third set where he allowed
Becker to hold his first serve after three games and broke Becker
anew from 5-2 to win the set.
</P>
<P>
But his hope of survival was clouded when he lost his third
game in the fourth and final set.
</P>
<P>
Trailing at 2-5, Chang became apparently unpatient. A double
fault stripped him of the last chance to rescue.
</P>
<P>
After Chang hit the ball against the net, Becker celebrated his
victory by holding up his arms, a gesture he depicted five years
ago when he won his first Australian Open in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Yet for Chang, the 1996 edition remained to be a glory where he
entered the final for the first time and did not lose a single set
en route.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Determined to Let Parastatals Go Privatised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will
set up a national investment trust to enable local people to buy
shares in parastatals which are being privatised.
</P>
<P>
It is the major step of the country's economic reforms this
year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which embarked on the western-backed economic
structural adjustment programme in 1990, is entering its second
five-year phase this year.
</P>
<P>
Minister of state in the president's office Cephas Msipa said
that the next move is to privatise the parastatals, by bringing
in the privatge sector to participate either as individuals or
organisations, the Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
"In order to facilitate the people's participation," he said,
"we have to find means to enable them to do this. We know they
have no money, so we have to create a special facility. This is
where the national investment trust comes in."
</P>
<P>
There are more than 40 parastatals in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
University of Zimbabwe economic lecturer Clever Mumbengegwi
said that the government can put seed money into the trust to
enable individuals to buy shares in privatised companies.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of having a drought levy, to which all workers are
contributing, such a levy can be turned into an investment
trust," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economists suggested that the government should sell its
shares in its various quoted companies and raise money to pay off
its huge debts.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is paying 12 billion Zimbabwe dollars (1.4 billion US
dollars) annually in servicing its 37 billion Zimbabwe dollars
(4.1 billion US dollars) debt, whose 60 percent is foreign.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Leather Industry Dynamic in Pakistan (by Hu Xiaoming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 28 (Xinhua) -- The leather industry, being
the second biggest export-oriented industry in Pakistan, occupies
an important place in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The annual industry capacity is estimated at 47.6 million
square meters of chrome tanned and 28.2 million kilograms of
vegetable tanned leather in the country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has a large livestock population production of around
5.8 million hides and 42 million skins per annum, according to
Khawaja Muhammad Abdullah, chairman of the Pakistan Tanners
Association.
</P>
<P>
The output of goal and sheep is projected to rise from 34.6
million pieces in 1987 to about 46.3 million pieces in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The leather industry is heavily concentrated in big cities like
Karachi and Lahore due to the availability of skilled and
semi-skilled labor and technicians and a well-developed market for
hides and skins.
</P>
<P>
Apart from catering to the entire domestic demand, Pakistan
produces a sizable surplus for export as the demand from abroad
for finished leather goods is increasing, making it one of the
major sources of foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year 1984-85, Pakistan's leather exports were
191 million US dollars. But they raised to 648 million dollars
during the year 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Major buyers of Pakistan's leather garments are the Unite
Kingdom, the United States, Germany and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Facing tough competition in the international market, the
Pakistan government has taken many positive steps to encourage
exports of leather products, including exemption from customs
duty, sales tax, surcharges on imported raw materials used by the
leather garments industry.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a recent package of incentives to boost leather
export, the government has allowed duty-free import of not only
raw hides, skins, pickled and wet blue leathers but also finished
and crust leathers.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Urges Lower Birth Rate in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 28 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe has
urged organisations involved in the control of population growth
to work toward reducing the country's birth rate from the present
2.7 percent to a rate that can be sustained by economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a memorial service for the late Amai Sally Mugabe
at the child survival and development foundation offices here
Saturday, Mugabe said Zimbabwe's birth rate is still too high and
that the economy cannot sustain it.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the reasons why there have been so many reports
of shortages in hospitals, schools and social welfare services
being provided by the state, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said, a lower birth rate would mean a smaller
population that could be sustained by available resources.
</P>
<P>
An economy that could sustain the needs of its population
would in turn mean a population with children that has enough
food, education and adequate health services, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The birth rate is still too high although we managed to
reduce it from 3.6 percent in 1980 to the current 2.7 percent.
That birth rate is not sustainable in terms of resources and
measures should be taken to control it," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- In Bangladesh, 750 petrol-driven
vehicles and 25 diesel-laden ones will use compressed natural gas
as substitute for fuel oil in a bid to reduce oil import and save
foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
"Compressed natural gas is a significant success in the uses of
the country's mineral resources. It is economic,
environment-friendly and mechanically safe," Minister of Energy
and Mineral Resources Mosharraf Hossain said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that with the fast increasing of the number
of automobiles in the country, the import of fuel and spending on
it in foreign currency had also increased to a great extend.
</P>
<P>
However, Bangladesh occupies an abundant natural gas reserve,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Du Pont Holes Up After Alleged Killing of Olympic Champion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Millionaire John du Pont,
heir to a chemical fortune, was still holing up in his 800-acre
estate near Philadelphia on Saturday, a day after he allegedly
shot and killed an Olympic wrestling champion.
</P>
<P>
Police negotiated by wireless telephone with du Pont, who
barricaded himself in his mansion in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania,
but the 57-year-old heir to the Du Pont chemical fortune refused
to surrender.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations and conversation continue," said Newtown Township
Police Lieutenant Lee Hunter. He said police had no plans to storm
the mansion.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont allegedly shot and killed Dave Schultz, a 1984 Olympic
gold medalist and 1983 world champion who worked as a wrestling
coach for du Pont's club team based at the estate and lived there
with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
Schultz, 36, was also training for a comeback at the 1996
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Police said du Pont pulled up in his car and opened fire as
Schultz was standing outside his home on the estate grounds Friday
afternoon, hitting Schultz three times.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said police had witnesses to the shooting and declared
du Pont as the lone suspect. The estate, about 13 miles outside
Philadelphia, was now surrounded by a force of 75 officers.
</P>
<P>
Newtown police chief Michael Mallon said they knew of no motive
for the shooting. Witnesses said there was an argument before the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors described the millionaire as an eccentric man. One
woman said du Pont once drove up to her house in an armored
personnel carrier and asked if her husband could "come out and
play."
</P>
<P>
Residents also recalled that du Pont drove two luxury cars into
a pond on his property, one after the other.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont is a great-great grandson of E.I. du Pont, who founded
the Du Pont, a giant chemical company, in 1802. The du Pont family
is estimated to be worth more than 10 billion dollars and John du
Pont's fortune was put at about 46.2 million dollars in 1985 by
his ex-wife.

Reports reaching here today said that Kamal Hossain, 14,
succumbed to his wounds as police allegedly fired tear-gas shells

MANAGUA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Violeta
Chamorro is sending a commission to the north of the country to
investigate reports of rape, robbery and abuse by a paramilitary
group in San Jose de Bocay.
</P>
<P>
Allegations that an army of about 70-80 "volunteers" had been
committing serious crimes in the area over the last few years were
made by Bishop Abelardo Matta during a two-hour meeting with the
president.
</P>
<P>
But Nicaraguan Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Joaquin Cuadra
denied the allegations and assured the president that Army troops
had been withdrawn from San Jose de Bocay in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, on Friday the bishop repeated his claims about the
paramilitary group which is "in some way linked to the army."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chamorro condemned "those groups of bandits, such as those
who attacked (presidential candidate) Arnoldo Aleman."
</P>
<P>
"I am against war, violence, and death," she added.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of armed groups are operating in mountain areas in the
north of the country, committing crimes such as holdups,
kidnappings, and even massacres.
</P>
<P>
An armed gang headed by Raul Moreno Ruiz, also known as "The
Wolf", attacked the motorcade of Liberal Alliance Party
presidential candidate Arnoldo Aleman Thursday, killing one of
police escort and injuring three others.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Prime Minister Jozef
Oleksy, who resigned this week over spying allegations, was today
elected chairman of the former communists, the Social Democracy of
the Republic of Poland (SDRP) party.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy, who ran unopposed, was chosen unanimously as the new
chief of the SDRP, replacing Aleksander Kwasniewski, who quit the
party after being elected President of Poland in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The SDRP is one of two parties in the electoral alliance, the
Democratic Left Alliance (DLA), the main partner in the ruling
coalition with the smaller Polish Peasant Party.
</P>
<P>
The SDRP praised Oleksy's work as head of the government and
sympathized over his resignation, which, they said, was due to
unprecedented slander.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy resigned after former President Lech Walesa accused him
of spying for the intelligence agencies of the former Soviet Union
and Russia for over a decade. A parliamentary special committee
was set up to investigate the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Oleksy admitted being a friend of a Russian diplomat, who later
turned out to be an intelligence agent, but denied that he had
passed on any information to him.

KATHMANDU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba said today that leprosy was not a disease caused by
any curse and the patients should not be discriminated against by
the society.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the 43rd World Leprosy Day today, the prime
minister issued a message, urging the Nepalese people to
demonstrate their humanitarian commitment to leprosy patients.
</P>
<P>
The government had adopted a health policy to materialize the
slogan "Health for All by 2000," Deuba said, adding that it had
given adequate attention to curing leprosy as well as other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
He said that a large variety of medicines were available in
Nepal now and a leprosy patient could be cured by undergoing
treatment at home regularly.
</P>
<P>
He also called for efforts to find out other more favorable
ways to address the problem of leprosy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Health Minister Arjun Narsingh K. C. said today in
his message on the World Leprosy Day that most people in Nepal
still knew little about the disease of leprosy.
</P>
<P>
He urged the general public to bring leprosy patients into the
mainstream of social, educational and economic life by creating
job opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the total number of leprosy patients
exceeded at least 100,000 in Nepal whose whole population stands
at 20 million.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- France conducted its sixth
underground nuclear test on Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific
this evening, the French Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The blast, bigger than the five previous tests carried out at
the end of last year, was detonated at 21:30 GMT and was
equivalent to less than 120 kilotonnes of conventional explosives.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the test was aimed at guaranteeing the
security and reliability of the country's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
France carried out five nuclear tests from September to
December in 1995 with explosive powers equivalent to between 20
and 110 kilotonnes of high explosives.
</P>
<P>
The communique did not say whether today's test is the
last. President Jacques Chirac, who announced the resumption of
nuclear testing in June, said in October that France would
probably reduce the tests from the planned eight to six.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Charles Millon echoed Chirac's offer later by
saying the country would complete its nuclear testing by February
1996.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that by resuming nuclear testing which had been
suspended since 1992, France is trying to test TN-75 nuclear
warheads, which will be used to equip new French submarines, and
to perfect its nuclear laboratory simulation techniques.
</P>
<P>

explosion of its first atomic bomb in February 1962.

<HEADLINE> Two Thirds of China's Population Affected by Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- About two thirds of China's 1.2
billion population have been affected by cigarette smoking,
according to a latest national survey.
</P>
<P>
The sample survey shows there are 350 million cigarette-puffing
population and 460 million passive smokers in China.
</P>
<P>
The survey says the passive smokers suffer the similar illness
and pains as the cigarette addicts.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that among the 340,000 non-smokers surveyed,
39.75 percent of them are affected by the passive smoking, among
whom 67.1 percent are affected at home and 14.44 percent in
working or public places.
</P>
<P>
The survey states that in China, 60 percent of males aged
between 15 and 25 are smokers, a figure that jumps to 70 percent
for those over 25.
</P>
<P>
Although the rate for female smokers is low, their number is
growing, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
The top three killer diseases in China - cancer, heart and
brain diseases, and respiratory system disease - are all closely
linked with smoking or passive smoking.
</P>
<P>
The survey warns that if this tendency continues, there would
be two million people who would die of tobacco-related diseases
annually by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, 26 big and medium-sized Chinese cities
have banned smoking in public places and tobacco advertising will
be eliminated before the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Germany Backs Single Currency Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany will defend plans for a
single currency and European unification, German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl and Finance Minister Theo Waigel said today.
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Waigel, leaders of the country's two governing
parties, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian
Social Union (CSU), made the remarks after a joint meeting of
their parties.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who rejected a referendum on monetary union, said the
German election is "the best referendum."
</P>
<P>
He said Germany will play a pioneering role in European
unification and warned that those who call for a delay in the
process will destroy it.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said he opposes "softening" the strict Maastricht Treaty
criteria for joining the single currency, even though most of the
15 EU nations, including Germany, don't currently meet the
conditions.
</P>
<P>
A number of European politicians have called in recently for a
delay in plans for the single currency by 1999, since tough
budgetary requirements to meet the stringent criteria have been
blamed for rising unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France had reiterated their commitment to the
single currency plan on Thursday, though a draft study made public
Friday said Germany risks missing the budget requirement this year
for the second time.
</P>
<P>
But in today's Financial Times, British Prime Minister John
Major says he believes the project could be postponed or even
abandoned, and no longer feels under pressure to hold a referendum
on the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted a senior British minister as saying that
government heads of member countries of the European Union could
decide this year to delay the 1999 starting date for monetary
union until 2000 or 2001.

<HEADLINE> Tajik President Says Won't Quit Amid Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov said today he will continue to fight for peace in his
country and won't resign.
</P>
<P>
"I have been elected by the people..., I will not abandon the
country in the middle of the way, although many (people) would
like me to do so," the president said at a news conference in
Dushanbe, the capital of the country.
</P>
<P>
In meeting with visiting Russian Defense Minister Pavel
Grachev, Rakhmonov said there are people within and outside
Tajikistan who are trying to worsen the situation and to force him
out of the political arena.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been growing in the Central Asian country as
Islamic rebels driven from the country in 1992 have been carrying
out attacks in the country and demanding the resignation of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The crisis worsened after Tajikistan's highest Muslim cleric,
Mufti Sharipov, and his family were murdered on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Tursunzade, some 60 kilometers west of the capital Dushanbe,
armed men led by a former mayor were holding Tajik troops
hostage. In a separate incident, a unit of Tajik armed forces
surrounded police headquarters in the southern city of
Kurgan-Tyube.
</P>
<P>
The rebels demanded the resignation of the Tajik government and
a withdrawal of CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)
peace-keepers, including Russian troops, from the country.
</P>
<P>
Grachev flew today to Dushanbe to discuss the unrest with
Rakhmonov.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia will reinforce its border troops in the former
Soviet republic and help it strengthen its own military forces.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also discuss the possibility of deploying
Russian Air Force units in Tajik airports, Grachev told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Director of the
Federal Service, Mikhail Barsukov are also due to visit Dushanbe
to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
According to another report, Uzbek President Islam Karimov, in
a telephone conversation with Rakhmonov today, voiced support for
the Tajik government's political line and its measures to defuse
tension.  Karimov also promised economic aid for Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
However, Interfax news agency later quoted Rakhmonov as telling
reporters that the incidents in Tursunzade and Kurgan-Tyube are
almost over. The hostages will be released and the armed unit has
agreed to return to barracks.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Forecast To Be Steady This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A foreign trade expert
forecasts that the end of duty-free imports of capital equipment
by overseas-funded businesses will not eclipse China's attraction
for overseas investors, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Liu Zhiben, who heads the Foreign Investment
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, as saying that "China will (still) develop greatly in
the coming years in such sectors as basic industries, pillar
industries, high-tech fields and agriculture, where overseas
investment is encouraged."
</P>
<P>
The government has announced that overseas-funded businesses
which gain approval before April 1 this year may continue to enjoy
tariff-free imports of capital equipment, if the facilities reach
China before the end of this year. Big contracts involving more
than 30 million US dollars could have a transferring period of two
years.
</P>
<P>
Liu said China will deepen economic reform following last
year's broad-base renovation in fields covering taxes, finance and
foreign trade administration. The reforms will bring China's trade
practices closer to international standards.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors will gradually receive national treatment --
which will be a two-sided coin: preferential treatment will be
weakened; unfair treatment -- vis-a-vis domestic businesses --
will be removed.
</P>
<P>
The process will be achieved "gradually", Liu said.
Overseas-invested businesses still enjoy such priorities as
"two tax-free years and three years of reduced tax" after they are
launched, and those in the special economic development zones will
continue receiving the favorable policies granted to special
economic development zones.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the investment environment will continue to improve,
and legal systems related to investment will be upgraded," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many big projects will go into operation in the 1996-2000
period and such sectors as finance, insurance, foreign trade and
retail sales will be opened wider, suggesting better opportunities
for overseas investors, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that actual in-flow of overseas investment to
China will "maintain certain growth" in the coming years. Annual
arrival of overseas capital could reach around 30 billion US
dollars during the 1996-2000 period, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of last year, contracted overseas investment to
China has accumulated to 395.7 billion US dollars. So far only one
third of these pledged investments have actually arrived, and the
rest are mostly expected to appear in the next few years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the first half of the year might see a small
investment climax due to the fact that a number of overseas
investors are seeking to gain approval for new investment
contracts before April 1 so as to take full advantage of the dying
tax-free import for capital equipment policy.
</P>
<P>
by the end of last year, China had approved a total of 258,000
overseas-invested projects and had absorbed actual capital input
from abroad of 135.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the focus of introduction of overseas funds will
switch from quantity to quality in the future.

<HEADLINE> Russian Delegation To Go to Tajikistan Over Rebellion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 28 (Xinhua) -- A team of senior Russian
officials including Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will fly to
Tajikistan Sunday to help the former Soviet republic cope with its
most serious crisis since the 1991 civil war, the Interfax news
agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Also among the group are Federal Security Service Director
Mikhail Barshukov, Federal Border Guard Service Director Andrei
Nikolayev and Nationalities Minister Vyacheslav Mikhailov.
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev arrived in the Tajik capital of
Dushanbe Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The group are expected to meet Tajik President Emonali
Rakhmanov and help the Central Asian republic make peace with
opposition Islamic rebel groups who have been carrying out attacks
in the country and are demanding the resignation of the government.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been mounting in the tiny mountainous country
bordering Russia since Friday night, when a group of gunmen led by
Makhumd Khudoberdyev, commander of the 11th special brigade of the
Tajik Defense Ministry, disarmed guards in a joint police and
customs post in Kurgan-Tyube, the capital of the Khatlon region.
</P>
<P>
Some of the gunmen are occupying the building of the region's
interior department and executive council, while others are now in
control of the road to Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
Khudoberdyev and his followers are demanding the secular
government step down, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, gunman led by the former mayor of
the Tajik town of Tursun-Zade, Ibod Boimatov, took 10 local
servicemen hostage at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Like Khudoberdyev, Boimatov is urging the government to resign
and peacekeeping troops from Russia and other CIS countries to
leave Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in Dushanbe, Rakhmonov stressed
that he will not resign and that the two incidents "have been
virtually settled."
</P>
<P>
Boimatov had agreed to surrender arms on Sunday and free the 10
border guards and Khudoberdyev will also turn over arms and
return his troops to the barracks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Accusing some forces of trying to destabilize the country,
Rakhmonov cited the recent murder of Tajik Moslem spiritual leader
Fatkhullokhan Sharifzoda and the ongoing events in Kurgan-Tyube
and Tursun-Zade.
</P>
<P>
"I have been elected by the people...... I will not abandon the
country in the middle of the way, although many (people) would
like me to do so," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Speaking alongside Rakhmonov, Grachev said Russia will not
abandon Tajikistan and will provide assistance to the country in
building an army.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the situation in Tajikistan may deteriorate
if the peace talks between the government and the Islamic
opposition remain deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
After being driven out of Tajikistan in early 1992, Islamic
forces opposed to the Dushanbe secular government have continued
to stage cross-border attacks from their bases in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Investigation on Samper's Campaign Spending to Be Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The results of a
probe of the financing of President Ernesto Samper's election
campaign will be known in 10 days, president of the National
Electoral Council of Colombia Oscar Jimenez said today.
</P>
<P>
But the preliminary investigation will only determine whether
Samper went over the legal spending limits, not to look into the
origin of the money, said Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
Imprisoned former Defense Minister Fernando Botero triggered a
political storm when he claimed Samper knew the country's drug
barons contributed funds for his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We already have 39 percent of the documents and now the
National Electoral Council is evaluating the evidence to take a
decision in the next few days and establish whether to open a
formal investigation, or to file away the proceedings," said
Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
Jimenez added that the council requested a copy of Botero's
testimony, as well as the accusation commission report, from the
General Prosecutor's Office and the General Attorney's Office, to
complete the dossier of the investigation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ADB Loans To Fuel Economic Growth In Inland China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China will direct more loans
from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) into the country's central
and western regions to reduce the economic gap between inland
provinces and coastal areas, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Fei Yue, an official with the People's Bank of
China, as saying that China this year expects to get 1.1 billion
US dollars in ADB loans.
</P>
<P>
Although the figure is 100 million US dollars less than that of
last year, China continues to be the largest borrower of the
Manila-based regional development institution.
</P>
<P>
Of 10 candidates projects proposed for ADB finance this year,
four will be in inland provinces' power and transport sectors,
namely, an expressway and a railway in Sichuan Province, one
expressway in Jiangxi Province, and a hydropower plant in Guizhou
Province.
</P>
<P>
Fei said ADB is changing its strategic objectives for its loans
to China. It will not change its targets of improving economic
efficiency and environmental controls, but will replace its goal
of poverty reduction with one of balanced regional development.
</P>
<P>
The change matches the country's development strategy, which
has given priority to the development of inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
Fei said China will continue its close cooperation with ADB in
coming years, with annual ADB loans to China remaining at a level
around 1.2 to 1.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the country does not expect a continuous increase in
annual ADB loans since the total credit size of ADB will remain
around five billion US dollars in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the country will focus on the improvement of project
quality to ensure the best utilization of the ADB funds.
</P>
<P>
The official said most of the ADB loans will be used in the
road, port, railway and energy areas, and that agriculture and
environmental improvement projects will also be given priority.
</P>
<P>
ADB's 1.2 billion US dollars worth of loans last year flowed to
ten projects in power, transportation, agriculture and
telecommunications industries.
</P>
<P>
ADB has sent a working-level delegation to China to study the
candidate projects for this year and discuss the bank's plan for
the country from 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
From 1986 when it joined the ADB until the end of last year,
China borrowed more than 5.22 billion US dollars from the bank to
fund 47 projects.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Starts Negotiations with Kidnappers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Two European women kidnapped
almost a month ago may soon be freed as negotiations with their
abductors are now underway, unofficial sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the media blackout imposed by Costa Rican authorities,
the sources, who asked not to be identified, said that
communication with the kidnappers was established after the
discovery of a letter on January 22 in the Puerto Viejo church --
a site close to where the women were abducted.
</P>
<P>
Nicola Fleuchaus, 24, a German, and Swiss national Susana
Siegfried, 50, were kidnapped on January 1 from a mountain resort
in the north of Costa Rica by some 10 armed men.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers called priest Eduardo Bolanos three days later,
repeating demands made in a letter left at the women's hotel on
the day of the abduction.
</P>
<P>
The men demanded one million U.S. dollars, one million colons
(just over 5,000 dollars), an 18-percent salary increase for all
public employees, and no price increases on public services like
water, electricity and telephones.
</P>
<P>
There was then no word from the kidnappers for more than three
weeks despite calls for negotiations from the Costa Rican
authorities and the women's relatives, and an intense nationwide
police search.
</P>
<P>
The latest letter was found after police retreated to give
the kidnappers room to make contact with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The same unofficial sources say the three-page letter repeats
the kidnappers' initial demands.
</P>
<P>
Since the letter was found, Information Minister Alejandro
Soto, the only spokesman for Costa Rican authorities authorized to
talk about the matter, stopped formal contact with the press who
have been circulating a variety of rumors.
</P>
<P>
Nicola's mother, Karin Fleuchaus, who came to Costa Rica after
the kidnapping, sent her daughter a radio message telling her to
be firm.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Fleuchaus also told the kidnappers she feels "impotent and
forlorn" because she cannot negotiate, just plead.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Base to Rise in Three Gorges Reservoir Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 28 (Xinhua) -- China will invest nearly 900
million yuan (about 108 million US dollars) in building a chemical
project in Fuling, in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
This is part of efforts China has made to help the development
of the area of the Three Gorges Project, one of the world-largest
water-control endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the chemical project will be able to produce
120,000 tons of phosphamidon, 170,000 tons of sulphuric acid,
200,000 tons of cement annually, and hand over 100 million yuan in
taxes and profits to the government.
</P>
<P>
Under plans mapped out by the central government and the
Sichuan Province, Sichuan's Fuling Prefecture and Wanxian County
will build a chemical base in the reservoir area of the Three
Gorges Project by taking advantage of abundant salt and natural
gas resources there.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir area extends from Yichang in central China's
Hubei Province to Sichuan's Chongqing, involving all districts
which will be wholely or partly submerged when the reservoir holds
water at a normal height of 175 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province has selected 20 chemical projects for
development in the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000). If approved
by the central authorities, these projects will need a total
investment of eight billion yuan, and are capable of producing an
output value of 3.7 billion yuan and 1.2 billion yuan in taxes and
profits annually.
</P>
<P>
Development of these projects will create 100,000 jobs
including 15,000 to 20,000 relocated local people, local officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Croats Demand Power in Sarajevo Be Equally Divided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Croats said today they
want equal power with the Muslims and the Serbs in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Future Sarajevo should be home to the Croats and the Croats
should have equal status with the Muslims, the Croat National
Council said today in a communique.
</P>
<P>
But the Muslims, the dominant ethnic group in Sarajevo, have
recently proposed making Sarajevo a province in the Muslim-Croat
Federation and to divide its power in proportion to its ethnic
population.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord signed in Paris last month,
Sarajevo will be united after the Serbs return the sections of the
city under their control to the Muslim-led government by January
31.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims' proposal is strongly opposed by both the Serbs and
Croats, who are demanding self-rule for fear of possible
oppression by the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are more than 300,000 Muslims in
Sarajevo compared with 130,000 Serbs and 17,000 Croats.

<HEADLINE> More Than 200 Serbian Prisoners of War Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee for
the Red Cross (ICRC) on Saturday confirmed that 242 Serbian
prisoners of war have been released by the Muslim and Croat
factions of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The release took place at the Sarajevo airport this afternoon,
with 127 set free by the Croats and 77 by the the mainly
Muslim-led government.
</P>
<P>
ICRC spokesman Pierre Gauthier said the government freed
another 38 Serbs near Zenica in central Bosnia but there were no
details.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serbs were also scheduled to release 180 Muslims
and Croats they were holding on the same day, but postponed it for
what was believed technical problems."They will be released
tomorrow," said Dragan Bulajic, head of the Serb Prisoner Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian factions met Friday and agreed to free all their
prisoners, which was supposed to be accomplished by January 19
under the peace agreement signed last month in Paris.
</P>
<P>
But the exchange came to a halt after the Bosnian government
raised the issue of those missing in the 42 months of the civil
war. Prior to Saturday's release, there were still 645 prisoners
of war held by three sides as counted by ICRC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Berislav Pusic, head of the Croats' Exchange
Commission, said on Saturday that some Serbs accused of war crimes
would not be released for the moment, but he did not rule out
swaps in future.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 28 (Xinhua)-- Ghana has earned its
ticket for the semi-finals of the African Nations Cup, the
biggest soccer event in the continent, after it defeated Zaire
1-0 in the quarter-finals today.
</P>
<P>
International striker Anthony Yeboah, who played in England's
premium team Leeds, scored the only goal for Ghana in the 23rd minute
at the match held at the Boet Erasumus Stadium in Port Elizabeth,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, formed by many international stars, would face hosts
South Africa, also widely considered the championship favorite,
in the semi-finals to be held in Johannesburg Wednesday night.

<P>
The tempestuous quarter-final match was marred throughout by
constant bickering among rival players as referee Sidi Magassa of
Mali found it hard to keep the match ground in order.
</P>

Ghana dominated much of the first half with their silky
ball-passing skills while Zaire managed to stay in the game with

having "blatantly kicked Ghanaian captain Abedi Pele Ayew in the
back" during their fight for a high ball, was sent off.
</P>
<P>
Faced with Ghana's tight defense, the Zairean "Leopards"
fought hard for an equaliser in vain.
