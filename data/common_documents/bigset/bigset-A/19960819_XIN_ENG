<HEADLINE> Last Semifinal Spot to Be Vied Later in Beach Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Three semifinal berths were
secured by the American, Canadian and Norwegian pairs, while the
match for the last semi spot was interrupted at the Beach
Volleyball World Championship in Espinho, Portugal on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dodd and Whitmarsh of the United States, Child and Heese of
Canada and Kvalheim and Maaseide of Norway were the first winners
for the semifinals slated on Sunday at Baia Beach.
</P>
<P>
The last semifinal spot would either go to Argentinians
Martinez and Conde or to Australians Prosser and Zahner after
their match was interrupted due to lack of natural light when the
score was 14-14.
</P>
<P>
The day was a really long one. Both the Americans and the
Canadians, silver and bronze medalists from Atlanta, were the
first to assure a place in the last four, after winning their two
matches easily.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians have been particularly impressive when they lost
only a total of nine points, beating in the first match the world
champions Franco and Roberto by 15-6 and in the second Prosser and
Zahner by 15-3.
</P>
<P>
Dodd and Whitmarsh had a slightly harder task, but they managed
to overcome the challenge of Argentinians Martinez and Conde and
Norwegians Kvalheim and Maaseide, and put their opponents in the
losers bracket.
</P>
<P>
The Scandinavians also pulled through although they had to
spend a couple of hours more in the Baia Beach stadium, winning
the decisive match against the last surviving Brazilian team Para
and Guilherme by 15-12.
</P>
<P>
Local favorites Maia and Brenha were unable to stop Brazilians
Para and Guilherme, losing by 15-5 and finishing in the thirteenth
position. But as Joao Brenha said, "the results we had here
allowed us to climb one position in the world ranking from 13th to
12th, and that's enough to say that this was a positive tournament
for us."

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Grain Production Expected to Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA August 18 (Xinhua) -- Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China is expected to have its eighth consecutive good
grain harvest, with grain and oil-bearing crops production hitting
800 million kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at various levels are achieving the
high-yield harvest by applying scientific techniques to farming
and building more irrigation works.
</P>
<P>
As many as 17,414 ditches, 17,000 km in total length, have been
built or repaired since last year. A number of ponds, motor-pumped
wells and irrigation facilities have been built, increasing
irrigated farm land by 10,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20,000 ha of low-yield farmland have been upgraded, and
6,000 ha of arable land have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
More than 52 million kg of seeds have been selected, and a
group of high-yield seeds have been sown to over 80 percent of
farmland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, abundant supplies of means of production, such as
chemical fertilizers and pesticide are guaranteed. Agricultural
technicians have been mobilized to go to the 'front line' of
production, helping protect 158,600 ha of crops against pests and
disease.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects of a good grain harvest is brighter than that of
last year, if no abnormal weather occurs," said an official with
the Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Department of the Autonomous
Region.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- More passenger and cargo
aircraft are on the runways of Shantou Airport, ready to help the
economy take off in the coastal city in south China.
</P>
<P>
Shantou Airport has handled a record 1.08 million passengers in
the first half of this year, making it one of the busiest airports
in China, according to a report released by the airport.
</P>
<P>
Last year it handled 1.96 million passengers and 29,734 tons of
goods, ranking No.13 and No.15 among all airports across the
country.
</P>
<P>
And in the 1991-95 period, the airport handled 6.64 million
passengers and 110,000 tons of goods in total, both well over four
times the figures of the previous five-year period.
</P>
<P>
Located in the eastern part of the prosperous Guangdong
Province, Shantou City has grasped opportunities to boost its
economy since it was listed in four Special Economic Zones by the
central government in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Booming economy and opening-up policy promised a huge potential
market for air transportation.
</P>
<P>
Shantou has opened more than 180 air routes, linking 44
domestic and overseas cities at present. In 1990 the numbers were
30 routes linking 14 cities, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Some international air routes have been opened since 1987,
linking the city with Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur
and some other cities.
</P>
<P>
Equipment and technology, updated continuously, have guaranteed
safety for aircraft for 22 years, which in turn has promoted the
development of the airport, the report said.

<P>
Kunming, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The recently-held '96 Kunming
Export Commodities Trade Fair attracted over 4,500 overseas
business people, including 1,800 from Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The participants traded goods worth a total of 1.253 billion US
dollars. Southern provinces of China alone signed contracts to
export over 160 million US dollars worth of goods to South Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Some observers held that the fair itself was good proof of the
rapid development of economic relations between Southwest China
provinces and South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the southwestern provinces of Sichuan,
Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan and Tibet launched joint efforts to
expand economic cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, in a
bid to bolster regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have won strong support from the central
government, as well as international organizations including the
Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the trade volume and personnel
exchanges between the two regions has been growing
speedily. Meanwhile the Chinese provinces have opened a number of
new aviation and railway routes to Southeast Asian countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A new habitat for aquatic birds
has been found on the edge of the Taklimakan Desert in northwest
China after five-years of observation by bird experts.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 birds, of some 100 types, thrive in the
habitat, the 28-sq-km Paman Reservoir of Xayar County, Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The birds include black storks and white-tailed sea eagles,
which are under the state's top protection, black-crowned
night-herons, green-crowned ducks and other birds.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time white-tailed sea eagles and black-crowned
night-herons have been discovered in Xinjiang. They usually live
in coastal areas and wet lands, near major rivers, ornithologists
said.
</P>
<P>
Taklimakan area is generally considered as a "forbidden zone of
life" due to its cruel natural environment. The bird experts
explained that the closed water area in Paman provided a safe
haven, rich in food, mainly fish, for the birds.
</P>
<P>
The experts are undertaking further research of the ecological
environment of the area, planning to set up a nature reserve for
birds.

LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Gambian military ruler
captain Yahya Jammeh is to contest the nation's presidential
election slated for next month.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh has announced that he would stand in next month's
general elections after banning the country's three main
political parties from contesting the poll, the local newspaper
Sunday Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, the newspaper said, has triggered a swift
reaction of the Commonwealth which said it was reviewing
relations with Gambia. The Commonwealth described the
announcement as " a very retrogressive step".
</P>
<P>
But Jammeh is believed to enjoy support for his bid from some
west African countries.
</P>
<P>
If Jammeh contests the election, the report said, he will
continue a renewed phenomenon of military rulers who exchange
their uniform for civilian dress while in office which began with
the election of Jerry Rawlings as president of Ghana in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Jammeh ousted the country's former President Alhaji Dauda
Jawara from office in 1994, promising to return the country to
civil rule.

of development, there are 8.2 million ha of forest lands, mainly
made up of bushland, and 2.5 million ha of grasslands.
</P>
<P>
The desertification areas boast bountiful solar energy
resources, which will be an advantage for developing agriculture,
and various kinds of desertification areas can be further
developed to serve as reserve land resources for agriculture or
animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to fight against the spread of deserts has achieved
initial success in recent years, with windbreak forests and
artificial grasslands built across large areas.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The blast, which occurred at about three a.m. local time (2200
GMT) in the tight security area of the National Logistic Cell
(NLC) godown at Thokar Niaz Baig, blew off the main iron gate of
the shed to a distance of 140 meters.
</P>
<P>
However, no casualty has been reported so far by local press.
</P>
<P>
Some of the army security guards were reportedly injured by
splinters of broken glasses. They have been rushed to a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Major Mohammad Shaukat, who is in charge of the NLC, told local
reporters that the fire, triggered by the explosion, engulfed the
electrical goods worth millions of rupees.
</P>
<P>
He said an inquiry has been initiated to ascertain the cause of
the blast and its motive, if any, in the army controlled area.
</P>
<P>
A high police officer said that the police was trying to find
out whether the fire was accidental or an act of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of drums containing chemicals were dumped and
the blast may be the result of a chemical reaction.
</P>
<P>
All fire-tenders in the city rushed to the scene and by three
p.m. (1000 GMT) the fire was under control.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of importers also rushed to the spot to ascertain the
gravity of the situation and loss of the imported goods.
</P>
<P>
Some eyewitnesses said that the major explosion followed by two
successive blasts occurring within five minutes jolted the entire
area.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was of such a high intensity that the window
panes of many houses in the nearby places were smashed.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States government has
approved the offer of 30 million U.S.Dollars to the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG in Liberia to help boost the
force's activities in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has released half of the amount shortly after the
summit meeting of the Committee of Nine on Liberia of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) which
concluded at the mid-night Saturday, a source said today.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 15 million dollars will be made available by the
end of this month, the source told Xinhua from Abuja, capital of
Nigeria, by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the day to day upkeep of ECOMOG, the money will
also be used to procure logistics such as vehicles,
communications gadgets and other military hardware to improve the
effectiveness of its peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has since its establishment six years ago been seeking
to get enough funding and logistics to enhance its operation in
Liberia. Leaders of west African countries have made repeated
calls on the international community for aid.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the U.S. gesture is coming on the
heels of severe criticisms of the international community for its
indifferent attitude towards the seven year old crisis in the
west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Conference On Peace And Democracy
In Liberia, a U.S.-based non-governmental organisation, efforts
are being made for ECOWAS to get a donation of 40 million dollars
from the United States to enable the sub-regional organisation to
achieve its set objectives.

<HEADLINE> SADC Doubles Cereal Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Cereal output in the 12-nation
Southern African Development Community (SADC) has climbed 62
percent for the 1995/96 year compared to the previous season on
the back of a wet season.
</P>
<P>
Revised production forecasts in the latest food security
update published by SADC's Regional Early Warning Unit, show a
marked increase in cereal harvest from 16.27 million tonnes to
23.36 million tonnes.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, which has an estimated population of 180 million
people, comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Cereal production was projected to have substantially
increased in all countries including Tanzania which had earlier
forecast a 14 percent drop due to the late start of rains and
pest infestations.
</P>
<P>
Cereal production was forecast to have trebled in Botswana
(300 percent), more than doubled in Zimbabwe (220 percent) and
ranged from 23 percent in Malawi to 90 percent in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Notable production upswings were recorded in the war-ravaged
Angola with an 83 percent rise and Mozambique where output rose
78 percent.
</P>
<P>
''This improved performance follows a relatively good rainfall
season which encouraged increased crop plantings and resulted in
better yields,'' the unit said.
</P>
<P>
A combined regional cereal surplus of 910,000 tonnes was
forecast for the 1996/97 marketing year. enditem

<HEADLINE> Dalian Keeps Upperhands in China Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Leaders Dalian Wanda marched
ahead with a 4-1 victory on Sunday, enlarging its margin to six
points after 13 of 22 rounds of matches at China's Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua, second-placers prior to the matches, scored
only one point after being tied 1-1 on home turf by Chinese Army,
and slipped to the third spot while Guangzhou Apollo secured the
second spot after a 1-0 win over Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of Wang Tao and Per Arne Bloum of Sweden,
the Dalian elevens converted their dominance to four goals against
Jinan Taishan.
</P>
<P>
With one minute into the game, Sun Wei netted the penalty after
Patrik Svensson of Sweden was elbowed to the floor within the box.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, a goal by Taishan was ruled off-side before
Li Min slammed home the second for Dalian off a header from Wei
Yimin in the 30th minute.
</P>
<P>
Five minutes after the break, Svensson put his squad 3-0 ahead
before Su Maozhen netted a consolatory goal on the spot in the
55th minute when Dalian defenders were caught of stopping the ball
with fingers.
</P>
<P>
In the 80th minute, Wei Yimin made a solo run from the right
wing by beating the Taishan defenders to put the home side into
the unbeatable position.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, defending champion Shenhua failed to display its
form and flair even at the home turf where local fans were shocked
when Guo Hui swang in his header in the 20th minute for the
Chinese Army.
</P>
<P>
And Shenhua only scored the equliser through substitute Shen Si
in a goal-mouth melee in the 46th minute.
</P>
<P>
In other matches of the day, Guangzhou Apollo won its home
match 1-0 against Shenzhen and overtook Shenhua for the second

<HEADLINE> Out-Going Liberian Leader on Dismissal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Out-going Chairman of the Council
of State and Head of Liberian National Transitional Government
Professor Wilton Sankawulo has openly accepted responsibility for
failure to restore peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Sankawulo who was replaced by a former Liberian Senator Ruth
Perry on Saturday said although the implementation of the Abuja
peace accord signed last August was a collective responsibility
of the six-man council of state, he, as the chairman, should
logically take both credit and blame for success and failure
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In his farewell speech at the just-concluded summit of the
Committee of Nine on Liberia of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), Sankawulo attributed his disgraceful
tenure to a number of reasons, including his appointment 12
months ago, Xinhua learned today from a source in Abuja, capital
of Nigeria, through telephone.
</P>
<P>
But he complained that his efforts were frustrated by the
conflicting words of other members of the council that created
confusion among people and altered the focus of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
The problem, he added, was further compounded by lack of
resources to implement the Abuja accord which requres billions of
US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Sankawulo said he has no regrets all the same as the
12 month tenure has offered him a wealth of experience which he
believes could guide in future endeavours, especially at such a
time that he may again find himself serving in a similar
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has promised not to interfere in any way with
the present administration unless he is called upon to offer any
advice as may be needed, the source said.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Overfishing Bringing Down Greece's Fish Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Overfishing by Greek fishermen
has led to the decline of many fish species, and the country's
experts are blaming "bad eating habit" as part of the cause.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing is almost everywhere in Greece, but the species
overfished differ from region to region, says the National Center
for Marine Research in a recent study on trawler fishing.
</P>
<P>
Among all species, cod is the hardest hit as it is overfished
in every region of the country, and others such as red mullet and
pandora, which are very popular with Greeks, are also declining.
</P>
<P>
With a coastline of some 15,000 kilometers, fishing is Greece's
important business that employs more than 38,000 people, or about
3.5 percent of the active work force in the primary sector.
</P>
<P>
Greek fishermen sell about 150,000 tons of fish annually.
However, production has leveled off in recent years as each
fisherman's catch has started falling.
</P>
<P>
Constantinos Papaconstantinou, a top official of the National
Center for Marine Research, attributed the overfishing of certain
species of fish to the "bad" eating habit of the Greek people.
</P>
<P>
An example is sardines, whose consumption has gone down as the
living standards of Greeks rise and the species is considered
"the poor man's fish," Papaconstantinou said.
</P>
<P>
The result, he noted, is an overabundance of sardines and a
decline of the population of anchovy, which has taken sardines'
place as one of Greeks' favorable fish species.
</P>
<P>
Greek fishermen also throw away many kinds of fish, such as
monkfish, which is actually considered a delicacy in other
countries, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
A more expanded diet would help save species such as cod, red
mullet and pandora, said Papaconstantinou. "Greeks must learn to
consume fish they are not used to consuming."
</P>
<P>
In order to contain overfishing, the National Center for Marine
Research's study proposes setting up fish habitats by building
artificial reefs where fish colonies can multiply unharmed.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Have Mayors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Singapore, a city state on a
small island, will have a new position called "Mayor" and a few
Mayors will be appointed after the General Elections, Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong said here tonight.
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy speech at the National Day Rally 1996, Mr Goh said
that the Government will divide Singapore into ten to 15
communities, on a geographical basis. Each community can be one
whole town, or a combination of several Group Representation
Constituencies and single member constituencies.
</P>
<P>
In each of the ten to 15 communities, the Prime Minister said,
there will be a Community Development Council (CDC) whose main
mission is to care for the community and cement community bonding.
</P>
<P>
"To reflect the responsibility, authority and status of the
chairmen of the CDCs and town councils, we will create a new
position called Mayor. A Mayor will be appointed only if he chairs
both a CDC and a town council of a certain minimum size, say,
150,000 voters," he said. Singapore now has a population of nearly
three million.
</P>
<P>
"A Mayor will have to be an elected member of the Parliament,
but his appointment is by the Prime Minister," Mr Goh said, adding
that after the General Elections, he will appoint a few Mayors.

<P>
SINGAPORE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
said here tonight that his vision of Singapore in the 21st Century
is to build "a cohesive, vibrant, and prosperous country".
</P>
<P>
This country will be founded on justice and equality,
excellence and social mobility, discipline and graciousness, the
Prime Minister said, adding that by that time, citizens of
Singapore will care for one another, while the ablest commit
themselves to lead.
</P>
<P>
"History and geography made us a small island, in a strategic
location, with three million people of different races, languages
and religions. These are our material for building a nation. They
will always make our survival a challenge. If we don't understand
these basic facts, we will perish," he said in his lengthy speech
at the National Day Rally 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, "let us always be a cosmopolitan
city, a competitive player and valuable partner in the global
economy".
</P>
<P>
Noting that "building such a nation will not be easy", and that
"strong attitudes of self-sacrifice and service" will be needed,
the Prime Minister called on all the Singaporeans to "feel
passionately about Singapore".

<HEADLINE> France Restores All Plates to Mark Liberation of Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- France has restored all the 755 wall
plates in Paris to mark the 52nd anniversary of the liberation of
the city from Nazi Germany on August 25, 1944.
</P>
<P>
The plates commemorate the resistance fighters who died in
their underground war against the Germans, the French soldiers who
were killed when entering the city, and some foreigners and Jews
who were deported or killed by the Nazis from 1939 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
Many of the buildings which used to have plates on their walls no
longer exist today, and the new plates were placed on buildings
constructed on the same spot. Some old plates have been replaced by
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
Paris was liberated after a week-long uprising which came to a
climax when the Police Headquarters rose against the Nazis on August
19, 1944. The Second Armored Division of the French Army led by
General Leclerc first entered the city.
</P>
<P>
The French government restored 420 plates in Paris in 1994 to
mark the 50th anniversary of its liberation. A total of 1.5
million francs (300,000 U.S. dollars) were used for the project.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Extremists Kill 17 Youths in Algeria: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Islamic extremists cut the throats
of 17 people aged 17-25 last Thursday near Ain Oussera, 200 km
south of Algiers, for their failure to join extremist groups,
reported Algeria's privately-owned El Watan daily today.
</P>
<P>
The killing, one of the most atrocious since 1992 when Algeria
was plunged into turbulences, has not been confirmed by the
Algerian government.
</P>
<P>
A passenger bus was stopped by a false police road-block manned
by a dozen gunmen in Sidi-Laadjal, an isolated hamlet in the
region marked by plateaus, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen killed all those from 17 to 25 years old by cutting
their throats with knives and let the rest of the passengers go.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time for extremists to kill people for
their failure to join the range of extremists in their holy war
against the Algerian government, according to local media reports.

DAMASCUS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah arrived here today for a
two-day official visit to Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti crown prince was greeted at the airport by Syrian
Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
In his arrival statement, Sheikh Saad said his discussions with
Syrian officials here would deal with the latest regional and
international developments, including the delicate situation
facing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince said he would deliver a message to President
Hafez al-Assad from Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah
dealing with bilateral ties, which are seeing a rapid growth based
on solid foundations of coordination and cooperation in terms of
economic and political issues related to the two countries and
the entire Arab region.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Kuwait have been on good terms since 1990-91 Gulf
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad's visit to Syria falls within the context of a tour
which already took him to Egypt, where he held talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak Saturday on bilateral relations and the
peace process, and will also include Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Patients in Britain Face AIDS Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's national blood service
is putting thousands of patients at risk of contracting AIDS and
hepatitis from infected supplies, the British paper Sunday
Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
The appalling news is revealed in an internal report by
inspectors from the government's Medicines Control Agency after a
series of spot-checks. They paint the following worrying picture:
</P>
<P>
-- Vital equipment used for screening blood for hepatitis and
AIDS is not being properly maintained or cleaned;
</P>
<P>
-- Labeling procedures to ensure patients are not given the
wrong blood are being ignored;
</P>
<P>
-- Blood packs are not being kept in sterile conditions and are
being exposed to bacteria;
</P>
<P>
-- Blood is being kept at the wrong temperatures, risking
contamination by disease.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat health
spokesman, as saying that "this is a life or death issue. We need
immediate government action."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman Saturday night called for a parliamentary inquiry
into the National Blood Authority, which runs the service.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Express has also learnt that perfectly good blood
worth more than l million pounds (l.5 million U.S. dollars) -- the
cost of collecting it from 24,000 people -- is thrown away each
year.
</P>
<P>
The result is that blood centers are building up huge stocks of
blood. "At the end of a five-week shelf-life it is simply thrown
away," said Peter Bowell, a senior blood bank manager.
</P>
<P>
Last year Heath Secretary Stephen Dorrell ordered a radical
shake-up of the service which cut 300 jobs and was designed to
increase efficiency. However,it was claimed the plan had
backfired.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the National Blood Authority was forced to
appeal for more blood after stocks slipped to crisis levels.

<HEADLINE> Corsica Separatists Make 4th Attack in 4 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Corsica's separatist militants
today staged the fourth terrorist attack on public properties in
four days by bombing the local parliamentary building in the
administrative center of Ajaccio early today.
</P>
<P>
Terrorists threw a two-kilogram home-made bomb at 2:00 today
over the gate of the compound, which exploded on the ground in
front of the building, damaging several office-rooms, Agence
France Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Jean Baggioni, president of the Executive Council of
Territorial Community, said that the attack will not "prevent the
community from working for Corsica."
</P>
<P>
Like three previous attacks, no one has claimed responsibility
for today's attack.
</P>
<P>
A five-kilogram bomb exploded on the steps of a local court
building in Ajaccio at dawn Wednesday, breaking many windows in
the neighborhood and destroying two cars. Another bomb attack
seriously damaged the balcony of an official reception house early
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday morning, unidentified people machine-gunned the
facade of a local court in Bastia, another administrative center
of Corsica, a Mediterranian island.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the sudden resurgence of terrorist attacks,
which seemed to be symbolic only and had killed no one, is
becoming more and more disturbing to the French government.
</P>
<P>
The attacks came after one of the separatist groups, the
FLNC-Canal, declared a truce on July 3.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Fails to Reach Agreement on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli senior cabinet
ministers today failed to reach agreement on a plan for the
Israeli army's redeployment from the disputed West Bank town of
Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The senior cabinet ministers will meet again in a later date
after the failure to reach any conclusions today due to the sharp
disagreement between the ministers.
</P>
<P>
The new plan was presented by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai with a proposal to change the Oslo accords with regard
to the extent of Palestinians' control in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would
only gain the civilian control over the area, and the overriding
security control would remain in Israel's hands.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, the Israeli army is to pull back from
about 80 percent of Hebron, leaving all Arab neighborhoods of the
town under the full control of the PNA, designated Zone A.
</P>
<P>
However, under the new proposal, Hebron would no longer be
designated Zone A, but part of Zone B, an area of shared control,
with the Israeli army permitted to move freely as it deems
necessary for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
During today's cabinet meeting, Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy
of the National Religious Party demanded that the Jewish
community in Hebron be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian officials, having already accepted a
delay in the implementation of the Hebron redeployment,
repeatedly said that they would not renegotiate any signed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Queria
stressed that the Palestinians would not open new negotiations on
the Hebron issue, saying the Israeli troops should pull out in
accordance with the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsheh also said that the Palestinians
would not agree to Israeli troop patrols in the Arab neighborhood
as part of an Israeli redeployment in the city.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was supposed to
pullback from of Hebron by March 28. However, following a series
of suicide bombing attacks, the redeployment was delayed.
</P>
<P>
Then the redeployment was postponed again due to the May 29
Israeli general elections for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly said
he has been studying the issue of the redeployment in Hebron, but
giving no date when he would make the final decision.

<HEADLINE> Report: "Mad Cow" Disease May Spread Through Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have found
that the "mad cow" disease and its human equivalent may spread
through open wounds, said a report published today.
</P>
<P>
The finding, at the Institute of Animal Health in Scotland,
indicates that the fatal brain disease could be easily contracted
when infected materials come into contact with open wounds.
</P>
<P>
Scientists participating in the study were quoted by a report
in the newspaper Observer as saying that health care workers
should take extra cautions to handle infected materials.
</P>
<P>
Those who may come into contact with materials infected by the
"mad cow" disease and its human equivalent must take steps to
protect their skin from cuts and scratches, they said.
</P>
<P>
Under laboratory environment, the scientists successfully
transmitted scrapie, the sheep version of the "mad cow" disease,
to mice through cuts and scratches in their skin.
</P>
<P>
Skin scarification, they noted, has proved to be a more
effective way of transmitting the disease than either direct
inoculation or feeding contaminated material to the mice.
</P>
<P>
The discovery will have significant public health implications

<HEADLINE> France to Give Up Military Privilege in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- France is ready to give up the
special status of its troops stationed in Germany which was
inherited from the four-nation occupation troops in Germany after
World War II, French Defense Ministry officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The officials told Agence France Presse (AFP) that about 17,000
French soldiers would withdraw from Germany before 1999 and the
remaining 3,000 to stay in Germany would be integrated into the
French-German Brigade in the European Corps.
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said today that he is sad
about the imminent withdrawal of French troops from Germany.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with his French counterpart Charles Millon in
a rural inn in Balley, east of Lyon, Ruehe told AFP that the
"intimacy" between their two countries should be maintained by the
French-German Brigade in the European Corps.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe and Millon today also discussed the situation in Bosnia,
the renovation of NATO and joint armament programs.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that the two countries wished to make a
"new impulsion" to their cooperation within the European Corps to
carry out peace missions in the future.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers also expressed the hope that French
and German troops will share the same status when stationed in
each other's country.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany have recently shelved the joint programs for
the "Helios" military satellite and the "Tiger" combat helicopters
due to financial woes.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Attorney General Refutes Human Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
Attorney General Khalid al-Qidreh has rebuffed criticism made by
Amnesty International regarding torture of detainees in
Palestinian jails, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in East Jerusalem, today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Palestinian daily al-Ayyam published
today, al-Qidreh said that most human rights groups had made the
PA a target of rumors, lies and exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
Several local and international human rights groups published
statements condemning alleged death-during-torture incidents that
have recently taken place in a number of West bank and Gaza
prisons.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International issued a call Friday for an end of
torture in areas under the PA's control. The London-based human
rights group also urged the PA to abolish what it called political
detention.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qidreh told the paper that the PA will punish any individual
who makes mistakes. "The PA is concerned with human rights
issues, general and private freedoms, and guarantees the rights
of detainees during investigation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PA official also accused human rights organizations of
comparing Palestinian investigators with the angel of death,
saying that they always blame the PA for any death of disease
that attacks the Palestinian people. "It is a real organized
campaign against the PA," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Al-Qidreh said that certain people are trying to poison the
international community through such organizations. He advised
such groups to be mindful of accuracy in their work and to keep
from indulging in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the attorney general expressed his
appreciation to any constructive criticism made by human rights
groups, but not any act aimed at destroying the Palestinian
dream. He declared that no force will succeed in harming the
Palestinian support for the PA.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Hungary to Reconcile Before Joining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Romania and its neighboring
Hungary are expected to sign their much-delayed friendship treaty
in near future, a senior Romanian diplomatic official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Marcel Dinu, Romania's deputy foreign minister, said the move,
as an indication of reconciliation, would be in the two countries'
common interest.
</P>
<P>
The key obstacle keeping Romania and Hungary apart in their
negotiations is nearly opposing views on whether a clause
recommended by the Council of Europe on minority rights should be
included in the treaty text. Clause 1201 requires all European
countries to grant minorities "collective autonomy" and "group
autonomy" for their kin.
</P>
<P>
Budapest demanded this clause to be included in the treaty
text, while Bucharest brushed aside the suggestion by holding that
its inclusion would mean setting up "a nation within a nation" in
Romania.
</P>
<P>
Finally, both sides made comprises. They agreed to include
Clause 1201 in the treaty text if, agreed by the two sides, it
does not touch on the issue of group autonomy and does not require
either country to grant collective autonomy to the minorities in
their countries.
</P>
<P>
While signing this treaty, both parties would issue a political
communique and sign a reconciliation and partnership pact.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn said his country is happy
about Romania's explanation of Clause 1201 and he was willing
to sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
He called on both sides not to try to save face at the expense
of both countries' interests, which are the most important.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the pact, due to be completed in
September, is part of the two countries' diplomatic efforts to
join the same military alliance, namely NATO.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Warlord Johnson Backs New Govt Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's ethnic Krahn faction
leader Roosevelt Johnson said Saturday night that he backed the
appointment of former senator Mrs. Ruth Perry as the new head of
state.
</P>
<P>
"I think she is going to made a great difference and she has
our support," Johnson, one of the faction leaders involved in the
latest round of fighting that delayed the peace process in
Liberia, said in the Nigerian capital of Abuja where West African
leaders had just concluded their summit on war-torn Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Perry had been appointed the Chairwoman of Liberia's new
interim government, the Council of State, by the Summit of the
Committee of Nine on Liberia of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) to replace Professor Wilton Sankawulo.
</P>
<P>
Johnson also accused Sankawulo of representing the interest of
Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, the two faction leaders who are
Johnson's long-standing enemies.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who was reported to have been held hostage in the
Ghanaian capital of Accra since May "for security reasons", said
his faction has been ready for disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I don't want to leave Monrovia because i have better
security in Monrovia than anywhere else," said Johnson, who was
in Abuja attending the ECOWAS meeting.

<HEADLINE> Fake-Dollar Bill Detector Popular in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese-made fake-dollar bill
detector has become very popular in Southeast Asia, the Kyodo news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The device, produced by the Tokyo-based Matsumura Electronics,
is capable of scrutinizing 48 different features of bank notes for
authenticity in 0.7 second.
</P>
<P>
Using 12 optical sensors, it checks features such as paper
quality, print, ink and watermarks after the bill has been fed
into it.
</P>
<P>
Since the device hit the market early this year, the
manufacturer has received many orders from Asian countries and
Russia, where counterfeit dollar bills are proliferating.
</P>
<P>
Although Matsumura Electronics has increased its output by 40
percent to some 700 machines a month, it will take it one and a
half years to meet all the orders received so far, said company
owner Yoshihide Matsumura.
</P>
<P>
The majority of counterfeit dollar bills are crude and easy to
verify, because only a few kinds of ink can be used to print
dollar notes, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
So far, only about 10 of more than 500 kinds of counterfeits
found around the world are considered to be highly sophisticated
and difficult to detect, they said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to Eight in Mongolia's Cholera Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A cholera outbreak in
Mongolia has so far killed eight people and has infected 92
others, health officials said today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,901 people across the country were in quarantine
today, with many others released during the last two days, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
More people were released from quarantine than those ordered
into it, a sign that the outbreak has been brought under control
since the outbreak began a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is an infectious disease caused by bacteria which
attack especially the stomach and bowels, causing severe diarrhea,
and often lead to death if untreated.
</P>
<P>
The disease is most likely to be spread by contaminated food.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, in this capital city, vendors were banned from
selling food, and most restaurants were empty. People were warned
not to drink unboiled water and not to eat uncooked food.
</P>
<P>
The disease surfaced earlier this month in the northwestern
Hovsgol province, where the sale of beef were banned immediately.
</P>
<P>
The hardest hit is the small town of Khoetol, in the province
of Selenge, where 75 people have been confirmed sick with the
disease and eight others suspected to have contracted it.
</P>
<P>
Here, there were seven cases confirmed and 17 cases suspected.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, eight people suspected of infecting the
disease were in critical condition, and 43 in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Trains and flights to and from the cholera-hit northern areas,
including Selenge, Darkhan, Erdent, Suunkharaa, Mandal and Sharin
Gol, were suspended.
</P>
<P>
However, international passenger trains crossing the country
were allowed to pass through without stopping at any station north
of Ulan Bator.

<HEADLINE> US Extradites Escaped IRA Prisoner to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- An escaped prisoner from Northern
Ireland's Maze Prison returned to Britain from America today and
is being held in an Ulster jail, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
James Smyth was flown to Heathrow in a top secret operation and
handed back to British officers who took him to Maghaberry Jail in
Belfast, the provincial city of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Smyth was one of 38 Irish Republic Army (IRA) prisoners who
escaped 13 years ago from the Maze Prison, where he was serving a
20-year sentence for the attempted murder of a Northern Ireland
prison guard.
</P>
<P>
He had been fighting British demands for his extradition since
he was arrested in 1992 in San Francisco. His last hope of
avoiding being sent back disappeared Saturday when U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher signed the extradition papers for his
return.
</P>
<P>
Smyth, 42, had entered the Unites States on a false passport
after escaping from the Maze. He had lived under an assumed
identity in a San Francisco suburb and worked as a house painter
until his arrest in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The extradition is seen as an attempt by America to mend fences
with Britain after President Bill Clinton welcomed Gerry Adams,
the Sinn Fein leader, to the White House last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today called on Syria to cooperate closely against
the United States and Israel in his meeting with visiting Syrian
Prime Minister Mahmoud Zouebi.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said, "The new developments in the region and the
interventionist policy of the United States and the Israeli
regime necessitates closer cooperation and exchange of views
between Iran and Syria and other Islamic states."
</P>
<P>
He said his country considers cooperation with Syria as "a
serious priority in its diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
The two countries have common views over regional, Islamic and
international issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The current relations between Iran and Syria would serve as a
model for other Islamic states," Rafsanjani was quoted by the
official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Syrian Prime Minister Zouebi assured his host
during the meeting that Syria would stand by Iran in dealing with
any foreign threats.
</P>
<P>
However, the Syrian prime minister did not specified from which
foreign countries the threats come.
</P>
<P>
Zouebi conveyed the greetings of President Hafez al-Assad to
President Rafsanjani, and noted that the Iranian and Syrian
brotherly friendship has not only been productive in regional and
international levels, but also heralded a bright prospect for
political, economic and cultural relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
The official report did not mention whether the leaders of the
two countries discussed the issue of northern Iraq and the
four-way summit proposed by Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
IRNA also reported that the Iranian side proposed setting up a
joint venture with Syria in a bid to further consolidate bilateral
ties and to appraise common economic and industrial needs.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian prime minister, accompanied by a high-level
delegation, including six ministers, arrived here Saturday on a
four-day official visit.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Ministers of
the east and central African states have formed a regional

</P>
<P>
A statement issued here today by the Ministry of Foreign

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today announced that he would bow out as president of the African
National Congress (ANC) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
ANC's highest policy-making body, the National Executive
Committee, said in a statement here today after a weekend meeting
in Cape Town that Mandela had also informed it that he would step
down as president of the country when his term of office expires
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 ANC election would pave the way for ANC deputy
president and deputy president of the country Thabo Mbeki to
succeed Mandela as ANC president in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still unknown who will replace outgoing ANC
Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa who might remain as the
"symbolic ANC Secretary-General" until the new constitution,
adopted by the Constitutional Assembly on may 8, is certified by
the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Ramaphosa's deputy Cheryl Carolus would
continue to serve as de facto secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
ANC informed sources said Carolus, with strong backing from
Mandela, had earlier on Friday made clear that she would not be
available for nomination to succeed Ramaphosa.

<P>
ABU DHABI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Vitaly Ignatenko left here today on a private Russian
plane after a short visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
A well-informed Russian source here told Xinhua that Ignatenko
arrived here at noon to discuss with the UAE government the issue
of a seven-man Russian air crew, who had escaped from an Afghan
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The seven men flew out here and headed for Russia on the same
private Russian plane.
</P>
<P>
After a year of captivity, the Russian crew members made a
daring escape Friday from their captors, the Taliban movement, a
hard-line Islamic guerrilla group that had been holding them in
the southern Afghan town of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The Russian air crew boarded their IL-76 cargo plane and landed
Friday in Sharjah, one of the seven emirates in the UAE. The UAE
government agreed to hand them to the Russian side.

<HEADLINE> French Socialist Chief Urges Dialogue With "Paperless" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- First Secretary of the French
Socialist Party Lionel Jospin today asked the government to
re-open negotiations with African illegal immigrants, more often
called "the paperless" here.
</P>
<P>
"Between complete refusal and acceptance, there is a space
which is called negotiation, and this is what the government
should do," said the chief of France's biggest opposition force
on television.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred African "paperless" -- 10 of them are going on a
hunger strike -- have been occupying the Saint Bernard Church in
Paris for 51 days, asking for negotiation with President Jacques
Chirac on France's immigration policy which has been in force
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Jospin suggested the replacement of the present group of
mediators between the government and illegal immigrants by
nominating a "Mediator of the Republic" or asking the president
of the National Commission on Human Rights to intervene.
</P>
<P>
"It is about an extremely reduced population. It is not about
a clandestine population in France. We don't regularize the whole
world but regularize a certain number of cases," he said.
</P>
<P>
He accused the government of confusing the meaning of
"rigidity" with "firmness," not only in immigration policy,
but also in economic and social policy.
</P>
<P>
"If the government was sure about its good law, it could not
have let the situation develop in the past five months," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While the consumption stagnates, while the growth weakens,
the government persists in the same policy. Rigidity is not
firmness. A firm government is a flexible government," he added.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea to Withdraw from Disputed Red Sea Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- French mediator Francis Guttman
today informed Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Eritrea's
assurance that it will pull out its troops from Lesser Hanish
island, one of the three Red Sea islands claimed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with President Saleh, Guttman said Eritrea
agreed to pull out its troops as a goodwill gesture aimed at
resolving the dispute over the three Red Sea islands, the official
Yemen news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The French mediator flew to the Eritrean capital of Asmara
earlier today and secured the assurance from Eritrean officials,
and then flew back to Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the three islands flared up last December when
the two sides had a fierce battle and Eritrean troops took control
of the Greater Hanish island, the largest of the disputed islands,
before a ceasefire took effect.
</P>
<P>
Eritrean troops took over the Lesser Hanish island on August
10, according to a Yemeni statement. Zuqar, the third island,
remains under Yemen's control.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea on May 21 signed a French-brokered agreement,
under which the two countries would settle their dispute over the
three islands peacefully through international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The three islands sit astride major shipping lanes, 160
kilometers north of the strait of Bab el-Mandeb at the mouth of
the Red Sea.

<HEADLINE> 95' World Trade Shows Fastest Growth in 15 Years: JETRO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Global trade in 1995 grew by 19.5
percent over 1994 to 4.995 trillion U.S. dollars, the highest rate
since a 22.6-percent growth in 1980, the Japan External Trade
Organization (JETRO) said today.
</P>
<P>
The figures, based on the statistics of the International
Monetary Fund on a nominal exports basis, were published on
JETRO's annual "White Paper on International Trade."
</P>
<P>
The semi-governmental organization said that of the 19.5
percent growth in 1995, the industrialized nations accounted for
12.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The brisk growth was a result of the second year of recovery of
the developed countries, which was strengthened by the rapidly
growing markets in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The nine countries and regions in East Asia saw a 21.7-percent
exports growth from a year earlier, partly because of the
expanding Chinese market, JETRO said.
</P>
<P>
The Central and South America and Eastern European countries
also made great improvements in their exports growth.
</P>
<P>
JETRO said that service trade in 1995 increased by 14.5 percent
over the previous year to 1.230 trillion dollars on a nominal
exports basis and its volume accounted for about 25 percent of the
world merchandise trade.

<HEADLINE> IFOR to Destroy Ammunition in Serb-held Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The operation to destroy the
largest cache of ammunition ever seized by Nato-led Implementation
Force in Bosnia is well under way, an IFOR spokesman said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR on Saturday seized more than 300 tons of ammunitions
and mines in a former primary school at Margetici, a Serb-held
village some 45 kilometers east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The military action, code-named "Operation Volcano", involved
1,000 soldiers, including two infantry battalions and one
engineering battalion, from IFOR's three multi-national divisions,
said IFOR spokesman Major Brett Boudreau.
</P>
<P>
The findings will be destroyed in two remote sites near
Margetici over a week beginning Monday, because they had not been
reported to IFOR in violation of the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR has received some anonymous threats for its operation,
which led to a meeting in Pale yesterday between commander of IFOR
ground troops Lt. General Michael Walker and Serbian leadership.
</P>
<P>
Biljana Plavsic, acting president of the Serb republic, denied
that the threats represent her government's position, Boudreau
said.
</P>
<P>
But there was a "vacuum of cooperation" on the part of the
Serbian army, which refused to send a representative to the
meeting, the IFOR spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos, Muslim Leader to Sign Peace Deal Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
and Chairman of the MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF) Nur
Misuari today agreed to sign a comprehensive Mindanao peace accord
in Manila on September 2.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was forged at a closed-door meeting between Ramos
and Misuari in the coastal town of Malabang, Lanao Del Sur
province.
</P>
<P>
Before the final signing in Manila, the Mindanao peace accord
is expected to be initialed at the fourth round of peace talks
between the government and the MNLF in the Indonesian capital of
Jakarta later this month.
</P>
<P>
"But Ramos did not reveal the exact date of the Jakarta
meeting," said a statement issued by the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Ramos and Misuari were joined by negotiators from the
government and the MNLF after their 45-minute historic meeting in
Malabang.
</P>
<P>
The two men later boarded the presidential car in a motorcade
around Malabang, cheered by thousands of school children and local
residents who lined the streets and waved small flags.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a peace rally later at the Malabang airport, Ramos
said there were no secrets, "no hidden agenda, no backroom deals"
in his meeting with Misuari.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, Ramos formally endorsed Misuari as the candidate
of the ruling Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats for
governor of the autonomous region of Muslim Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Misuari said at the rally that history will note that President
Ramos played the most important role in restoring peace in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He chanted "peace now or never" three times at the end of his
speech.
</P>
<P>
The Mindanao peace accord is aimed at ending a 26-year-old war
between the Philippine government and the MNLF, in which 120,000
people died.

<P>
WEIHAI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Mergers between newspapers is
becoming an increasingly attractive trend in China.
</P>
<P>
So far, nine large-scale newspapers have merged with 12 small
newspapers and magazines, according to a working conference on
mergers of newspapers, held recently in Weihai.
</P>
<P>
Some problems exist in current newspaper development, such as
the excessive number of newspapers, duplication of contents and
low economic and social returns of some newspapers, according to
Liang Heng, vice-director of the Press and Publication
Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Liang said, many large newspapers, with
better tastes and management levels, have remained stable in the
country's news market, said Liang.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conditions for mergers in China's press sector
has matured.
</P>
<P>
But he also noted that mergers, as a new trend in the country,
should be tried cautiously.
</P>
<P>
At present, only newspapers run by organizations at various
levels of the Communist Party of China are allowed to merge with
others.

<HEADLINE> China's Sugar Price Picks up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Sales of sugar on the Chinese
market have started to move out of difficulty, according to the
Guangxi Sugar Trade Information Center.
</P>
<P>
In sales areas, the price of sugar has increased by 30 to 60
yuan per ton. Sugar in the Beijing market has risen to 4,150 yuan
(about 500 US dollars) per ton, sugar in Hangzhou has risen to
3,930 yuan per ton.
</P>
<P>
In Nanning, capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the
largest sugar producer in China, sugar delivered at the railway
station is 3,760 to 3,780 yuan per ton.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission and the People's Bank of China have
implemented a plan to reserve 300,000 tons of sugar (4,000 yuan
per ton). Of these, 400 million yuan for the stockpiling of 100,000
tons of sugar for Guangxi, and 40 million yuan for the stockpiling of
10,000 tons of sugar for Yunnan have been provided.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this financial move is positive, as it will
prevent a decline in sugar prices, promote sugar sales and
stabilize the production of sugar.
</P>
<P>
At present, the number of sugar-buying businesses in Guangxi
have apparently increased. Although Guangxi still has more than
600,000 tons of sugar in stock, many sugar factories have no sugar
to sell.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Regional Branch of People's
Bank of China in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has set up a
county-level fund-clearing network. It is the first of its kind
in China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,269 banks and financial institutions in 12 cities
and 100 counties are engaged in the business of clearing. All of
them have entered the integrated electronic fund-clearing network,
governed by the regional branch.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the network will help shorten the circulation
period of funds, which will lead to a 500 million yuan increase in
available funds for banks each day, and a 400,000 yuan decrease in
interest born by loan-receivers.
</P>
<P>
The network is expected to help relax the tight fund-supply in
the autonomous region, and is of great significance for the

<HEADLINE> Mahathir on Singapore Rejoining Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today the possibility of Singapore rejoining
Malaysia could not be ruled out but the former must first be
prepared to take into account the situation in the latter.
</P>
<P>
"Factors such as the position of certain races in various
aspects must be taken into account if the republic wants to return
to Malaysia," he said at a news conference at a golf resort near
Kuala Berang, some 350 kilometers northeast from here.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made when Mahathir was asked to comment on a
statement by Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on Sunday on
the possibility of the republic being forced to ask Malaysia to
take it back, Malaysian news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
He was also asked that on Malaysian terms, if Singapore's
economic competitiveness was to falter.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Mahathir was quoted as saying that the old
stance adopted by Singapore to push for a "Malaysian Malaysia" is
unacceptable in the context of the racial composition in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the matter might be held one day but it would
depend on the "mood" at that time, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore separated from Malaysia in 1965 because its leaders
at that time allegedly refused to accept the situation existing
in the federation which was formed in 1963.

<HEADLINE> HK to Adopt Permit Scheme on Shipping of Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
introduce a permit scheme to be effective from September 1 to
regulate the import and export of wastes, a government spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
The scheme for waste control is in line with requirements set
in the Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements
of hazardous waste and their disposal, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will require waste importers and exporters to apply
for a permit from the Environmental Protection Department (EPD)
prior to the commencement of a waste shipment in a manner
specified in the Waste Disposal Ordinance 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The scheme will enable Hong Kong to put under proper control
shipment of hazardous or contaminated waste into, from and through
 Hong Kong," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, it will facilitate the legitimate
trade in non-hazardous waste which is contributing to conservation
 through waste recycling.
</P>
<P>
The EPD will issue either a multiple-shipment permit, which is
valid for a period of up to 12 months, or a single shipment
permit.
</P>
<P>
The EPD will have control over the total quantity of waste to
be shipped under a multi-shipment permit.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the light of concern about the recent return of
 waste consignments from China, the Hong Kong government is now
bringing forward the implementation date of the scheme from the
end of this year to September 1.
</P>
<P>
He said that any person who imports or exports waste subject to
 control without a permit after September 1, will be liable to a
maximum fine of 200,000 HK dollars and six months' imprisonment
upon first conviction.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Meeting Calls for Dignity, Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The 42nd conference of the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) opened here today
with a call for restoring the dignity of human beings and
satisfying the hunger for justice.
</P>
<P>
Opening the six-day conference, Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim cited poverty, illness, deprivation, illiteracy and
ignorance as some of the social problems that need to be solved to
restore the human dignity.
</P>
<P>
Equal status, opportunities and remuneration for women are also
imperative issues, according to Anwar.
</P>
<P>
He said justice could not exist when the individual was
oppressed and fundamental rights were denied and when whole
populations were trapped in war and senseless slaughter.
</P>
<P>
"We are no where near dignity or justice when the global order
is dominated by a few who preach democracy at home and blatantly
deny it abroad, and when 85 percent of the world's wealth is
enjoyed by 20 percent of the global population," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the test of an effective parliamentary democracy
lies in the extent of the people's participation in the democratic
process and overall social development.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 representatives from 130 parliaments are attending the
conference which is expected to update members on democracy,
women's rights and environment issues, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also focus on cooperation among CPA members
and on ways to maintain and improve democracy in these members,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said Mozambique would be accepted as a new CPA member at
the conference, which will also consider applications from
Cameroon and two South African provinces.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economic Recovery Fragile, Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Two Zimbabwean banks today
warned the country's economic recovery is still fragile despite
projections of rapid growth following last season's good
agricultural season.
</P>
<P>
In separate comments, Barclays Bank Zimbabwe Ltd and the First
Merchant Bank (FMB) said that key sub-sectors of the economy are
still suffering from such problems as punitive interest rates and
distorted tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Barclays David Zamchiya said economic improvement
is ''very fragile'' and has to be carefully nurtured so that this
year's projected 6-7 percent gross Domestic Product Growth will
be sustained in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
''Of greatest concern is the survival of Zimbabwe's
manufacturing sector, which has suffered the most from a series
of drought-induced recessions, continued high inflation and
interest rates and increasing external competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the FMB said several companies had gone bankrupt
despite projections of sustained economic growth after last
year's recession, which resulted in a negative gdp growth of the
three percent.
</P>
<P>
He said: ''Despite a generally more optimistic outlook for the
economy, further significant business failures have occurred
during the last six months and a number of quoted companies have
issued warnings of lower than forecast results."
</P>
<P>
Economists here estimate the economy, which is still heavily
dependent on the agricultural sector for growth, will in 1996
grow by over six percent.

resolution 1070 is rejected by the Sudanese government and people,

At a meeting held Sunday, the Sudanese cabinet confirmed its
rejection of a U.N. proposed air embargo on Sudan, calling on the
U.N. Security Council to reconsider its resolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Friday decided in its resolution 1070
to give Sudan 90 days to hand over the three suspects allegedly
involved in the 1995 assassination attempt against Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in the Ethiopian capital of Addis
Ababa. Otherwise, Sudan will face an air embargo.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council agreed to meet in 90 days to set a date
for the ban to take effect.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet denied the accusations of Sudan's involvement in
the assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Ministry of Culture and Information Sunday also
issued a statement, saying that it regretted that the U.N.
Security Council resorted to air embargo to square political
accounts with Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The statement emphasized that Sudan would not bargain over its
religion and belief, and it would make no concessions concerning
its stability and national unity.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Mt. Merapi in Indonesia's
Central Java, 1,200 kilometers east of Jakarta, continued to emit
lava and thick smoke on Saturday and Sunday, said reports reaching

</P>
<P>
Suryono of the volcanology office in Yogjakarta, 30 kilometers

Between Saturday and early Sunday, the 2,962-meter-high volcano
blew smoke 500 meters into the air three times before spewing
lava, he said.
</P>

phase of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Project in east China, which
started in early June, has been going smoothly, China Nuclear
Industry News reports.

At present, concrete work on the A, B, and B2 layers of the
No.1 reactor plant have been completed, while construction work on
the C layer is in full swing. Construction work on other major
projects is also well under way, it reports.
</P>
<P>
August has been even hotter, but workers are doing a good job
of meeting their target for the month, it says.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Chinese-designed project went into
operation in 1991 with a generating capacity of 300,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, two 600,000 generating units will be added

<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Ross Perot, who four years ago won more voters than any
independent Presidential candidate in 80 years, accepted the
presidential nomination of his new Reform Party Sunday night.
Perot vowed to end the two-party system in this country.

<P>
The Wall Street Journal:

<P>
-- A report of the National Science Foundation says that U.S.
spending on research and development (R&AMP;D) totaled 171 billion
dollars in 1995, or two percent lower than the 1990 level. It

JINAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese pensioners, all aged
around 70, have cycled 5,300 kilometers across China to welcome
Hong Kong's return to the motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Guo Yulun, 67, Yu Yongzhi, 64 and Zhao Jingtong, 70,
accomplished their three-month adventure by arriving on August 15
at a checkpoint bordering northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Last October Guo decided to keep his hair long, and not to cut
it until next July when Hong Kong returns to China, in a gesture
to show his sincerity for the event.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, he joined the two other old people on the
marathon bicycle-ride, starting their marathon trek from Yongcheng
city in east China's Shandong Province. They rode all the way to
the western part of China.
</P>
<P>
During the 88 day journey they suffered from the heat and too
much sunshine, eating and sleeping in the wilds in more than 80
counties in seven provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
They also gave nearly 200 seminars and street speeches on their

Kong's return, to the warm applause of local governments and
masses as they passed through.

<HEADLINE> China's Material Price Remains Low In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- China's material market remained
sluggish in July, with the prices of most items falling by a small
margin.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistic by the China Material Information Center shows
that the overall price index of the country's material markets
dropped by 0.3 percent over June, and was 2.1 lower than July of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the center explained that a bigger supply over
demand, low increase in investment in fixed assets, and fund
shortages for businesses were the factors behind the sluggish
performance of the material markets across China.
</P>
<P>
In July, the prices of major material items monitored by the
center, such as steel products, nonferrous metals, chemicals and
electric machinery products continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
The average price for steel products was 3,129 yuan per ton,
dropping by 0.2 percent over June, and 2.5 percentage points lower
than the same month of last year. And the average prices for
nonferrous metals, timber and electric machinery products fell by
0.4 percent, 0.3 percent and 1.5 percent respectively, compared
with June.
</P>
<P>
With the slack season for coal consumption coming, the price
for coal scored a small increase in July. The average price was
258 yuan per ton, growing by 0.8 percent over June. Although the
increase was 0.4 percentage points lower than that for the
previous month, the price was still 20 percent higher than the
same month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Diesel oil was the only item with a distinct price rise last
month. With summer harvest and sowing starting in July, the demand
for diesel oil increased. In addition, oil transport was hampered
in several provinces in southern China, which were hit by floods
and typhoons. Diesel oil ran out in some places.
</P>
<P>
The average price for diesel oil was 2,139 yuan per ton,
growing 4.1 percent and 5.8 percent over June and the same of last
year respectively.
</P>
<P>
The experts predict the material market will maintain its
present performance groove for months to come, with the prices for
most items remaining relatively steady.

ULAN BATOR, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The drop in copper price in
the world market following the Japanese Sumitomo copper futures
trade scandal has dealt a blow to Mongolia's hard currency
revenues and worsened its already troubled economy.
</P>
<P>
Because copper is the major foreign exchange-earning product
for Mongolia, the fall in world copper price made the Mongolian
central budget revenues 3.3 billion tugrik (66 million U.S.
dollars) less than planned in the first seven months of this year,
said Prime Minister Mendsaihani Enhsaihan at a meeting with local
leaders of the ruling coalition parties.
</P>
<P>
The central government will further suffer a gap of at least
10.4 billion tugrik (21 million dollars) in budget revenues if the
trend continues unchecked.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has incurred heavy economic losses due to the spring
forest fire and serious floods in summer.

<HEADLINE> 110 Units Privatized in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
privatized 110 units in the country and received 50 billion rupees
(about 1.4 billion US dollars) of privatization proceeds, a senior
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen, Pakistani Minister for Privatization Syed
Naveed Qamar highlighted the efforts of the Privatization
Commission in making the entire process transparent.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-bid conference, he said, potential bidders are
provided with the information related to the unit to be
privatized.
</P>
<P>
This process is followed by an open auction in which the public
and the press are also invited and those offering the highest
prices are declared the highest bidder, he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Qamar said the Pakistani government
has used one-third of the privatization proceeds for
debt-repayment.
</P>
<P>
"Use of privatization proceeds for debt servicing is
unprecedented in our history," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The privatization is a complicated process but we did come
across certain problems," Qamar added. The continuation of the
process can boost public confidence in the procedure, he said.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate of Hong Kong for the May-July period was 2.9
percent, much lower than the 3.1 percent recorded for the
April-June period, according to official figures released today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest figures, a government spokesman said
labor market conditions continued to improve in recent months. In
particular, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell below
three percent for the first time in the past 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Decreases in the unemployment rate were mainly observed in the
wholesale, retail, import and export trades and transport sectors,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the growth rate of total labor supply coming
down to a level close to the growth rate of total employment, and
with the latter's growth continuing to be robust, this also helped
to lower the overall unemployment rate.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The resumption of diplomatic
relations between China and Niger has laid a sound and solid
foundation for the development of friendly co-operation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This is a view shared by Chinese Vice-Premier and Foregin
Minister Qian Qichen and visiting Chairman of the Council of Sages
of Niger Ali Saibou during their talks here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Qian extended a welcome to the Niger delegation led by Saibou,

a sound, solid basis for the expansion of bilateral friendly
co-operation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Saibou said Niger President Mainassara paid close attention to
the delegation's present trip, because its mission is to restore
Niger's diplomatic ties with great China.
</P>
<P>
Niger treasures and aspires to continue developing the valuable
ties between the two countries which was built with the kind
attention of late Niger President General Seyni Kountche, Saibou
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of diplomatic ties with great China represents

<TEXT>
<P>
Qian said that over the recent years, the Taiwan authorities,
taking advantage of the temporary economic difficulties faced by
some African countries, have gone all out to practise its "elastic
and pragmatic" diplomacy in the name of economic aid, undermining
the traditional friendly and cooperative Sino-African co-operation.
</P>
<P>
These actions are opposed by the overwhelming majority of the
African countries, Qian said, adding that China is confident in
Sino-African ties and the determination of the African people to
further develop this kind of relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian reiterated that there is only one China in the world, and
Taiwan is its inalienable part and the government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the
whole China.
</P>
<P>
This principle is commonly recognized by the United Nations and
the international community, and any actions of creating "Two
Chinas" and "One China, One Taiwan" or any other attempts aimed at
splitting Taiwan from China are doomed to failure, he noted. This
kind of splitting actions have met with opposition from the people
of China, including the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The question of Taiwan concerns China's state sovereignty and
reunification and, on this major issue, the Chinese government
will never give in or compromise.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is resolutely in apposition to any
countries having diplomatic ties with China to form official ties
with Taiwan but does not hold objective view on their economic
exchanges of the non-governmental nature with it, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Among those taking part in the talks are Chinese Assistant
Foreign Minister Ji Peiding and Niger Minister of Foreign Affairs
and Cooperation Andre Salifou.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Qian and Salifou signed a joint communique
concerning the resumption of diplomatic relations between China

<HEADLINE> Manila Drawing up Security Plan for APEC Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
drawing up a security plan to ensure the safety of some 3,000
delegates to the meetings of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum scheduled for November in Manila and Subic, an
official said today.
</P>
<P>
The plan will cover all security arrangements for the
delegates, including leaders of the 18 APEC members, said Lisandro
Abadia, director general of the APEC National Organizing
Commission, at a press conference in Davao city in southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the recent terrorist incidents like the TWA
explosion and the Olympic Games bombing in the United States,
security personnel will be extra strict in the inspection of all
vehicles during the APEC meetings, Abadia said.
</P>
<P>
He said although the visiting leaders may bring their own
bullet-proof vehicles, the Philippine government will make
available for them 18 bullet-proof Mercedes Benzes leased from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Some of the leaders are expected to go to Subic, about 80
kilometers north of Manila, in their own planes and some may take
either of the two airbuses to be leased by the government from the
Philippine Airlines, Abadia said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will declare November 22 (a Friday) and
November 25 (a Monday) to be holidays to help ease the flow of
traffic during the meetings.
</P>
<P>
According to the APEC '96 News Bureau, the major APEC meetings
will start with a special meeting of senior officials on November
20-21 to be followed by a ministerial meeting on November 22-23 in
Manila.
</P>
<P>
On November 24, APEC leaders are scheduled to join the region's
chief executive officers in a business forum to be held in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Abadia said the informal APEC leadership conference will be
held on November 25 in Subic. In case of bad weather on that day,
the leaders will meet in the Philippine International Convention
Center in Manila, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said about 3,000 foreign and local journalists are expected
to cover the event.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Calm Prevails in Jordan after Riot (by Wen Xinnian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Calm prevails in Jordan after two
days of rioting against an increase in the prices of bread and animal
fodder.
</P>
<P>
The southern city of Karak, where riots started Friday,
remained under a curfew.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Information Minister Marwan Muasher said Sunday after
a cabinet session that the situation in riot-stricken southern
Jordan had returned to normal, saying calm prevailed throughout
the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the government had made some arrests, but did
not gave any number.
</P>
<P>
Media reports here said that up to 130 people have been
detained by the authorities during the past two days and arrests
continued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said that only those directly involved in the destruction
of public property, robbery and looting rather than those who
participated in the demonstrations were detained.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that nobody was killed in the riots but minor
injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates put the number of casualties at 15 in the
two days of riots, during which police used tear-gas and rubber
bullets while the rioters attacked government buildings and
private banks.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that the public security forces
had received strict orders not to use live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
He said the curfew clamped on Karak was lifted for two hours
Sunday and it will be lifted completely soon.
</P>
<P>
On disturbances in Hay Tafaileh in Jofeh, near Amman early
Sunday, he said a group of minors had burnt garbage containers,
but the situation was dealt with and calm was restored.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers Sunday also asked Minister of Supply
Munir Sober to reconsider the increase in the prices of dairy
products, which was caused by last week's increase in the prices of
animal fodder.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, King Hussein and the government Sunday repeated
their accusations that some outside parties behind the events
should take the responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that the parties, which were accused
of instigating the unrest, are two left-wing parties, Hashed,
which is close to the hardline Palestine group the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Arab Socialist
Baath Party, which has close ties with the Iraqi branch of the
Baath Party.

<HEADLINE> Elections To Be Held in Zambia on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's presidential and
parliamentary elections will be held on schedule late this year and
will not be postponed as reported, according to today's
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza as
saying on Sunday here that the money for the poll will be found and
the elections will be held as planned.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling Movement for Multi-Democracy (MMD) will not
abrogate the requirement of holding the elections after its five-year
term expires late this year.
</P>
<P>
Penza was reacting to the reports that the elections may not be
held until resources for exercise are secured.

<P>
However, the opposition parties and officials in Karak
challenged the government's allegations.
</P>
<P>
Karak Mayor Ahmad Mahaddin, a member of the Islamic Action
Front (IAF) party, blamed Karak Governor and security forces for
the violence, according to today's English-language daily Jordan
Times.
</P>
<P>
He described the demonstration against the increase in bread
prices as "a peaceful march" that turned violent when security
forces rough-handled the protesters.
</P>
<P>
At least seven of the 11 members of the city's municipal
council insisted that there were no political groups behind the
riots, which they characterized as a spontaneous response to the
increase of the prices of bread and other commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Karak municipal council decided to send a cable to King
Hussein to inform him of the "misleading and inaccurate
information he is receiving about the events there."
</P>
<P>
A member of pro-Iraq Arab Socialist Baath Party rejected
accusations that his party or any other political grouping had
organized or instigated the violent protests.
</P>
<P>
They insisted on the government's resignation as an inevitable
step to calm the situation in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
It is not known how long the calm situation will last and
whether the unrest had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
The king had pledged to crack down on the protests with an
"iron fist."
</P>
<P>
During his unexpected visit to Karak Saturday afternoon, the
king told his loyal army officers: "We are standing on a
threshold. Either there is a state or there are outlaws and people
who want to sabotage this legend country."
</P>
<P>
Mayor Mahaddin and Karak residents warned that the calm in the
city could be broken again if the government did not roll back
its decision to increase the prices of bread, Jordan Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
They also said the town's residents were enraged by the tough
response of the authorities to their protests and insisted that
the government of Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti resign.
</P>
<P>
"This is a calm enforced by tanks, but the angry feelings
remain," said a young resident.
</P>
<P>
"If our demands are not met, then the riots will start again
once they (security forces) leave," another young protester said.
</P>
<P>
The protests and unrest in the Kingdom were a reminder of
widespread riots in 1989 when the prices of fuel were sharply
increased as part of an economic reform program supervised by the
International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> First Round of Parliamentary Elections Ends in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The first round of Lebanon's
parliamentary elections in the Christian-dominant governorate of
Mount Lebanon ended with a victory of the candidates close to
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's government, officials said this
morning.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the Interior Ministry's election
committee, all five ministers in Hariri's government were elected
with their coalitions won 26 out of 35 seats in the six
constituencies of the governorate.
</P>
<P>
Some 180 candidates ran for the Sunday election and the results
would be officially announced by Interior Miniter Michel Al-Murr
later today.
</P>
<P>
One hundred and twenty-eight new members to the
half-Christian-half-Moslem parliament will be elected in the
five-stage elections. After Mount Lebanon, polling in Beirut and
other three governorates will be held on the next four successive
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
In the Druze district of Chouf, the coalition of Minister of
the Displaced Walid Jumblatt, which included Minister of Public
Health Marwan Hamadeh, snatched all the eight seats, a most epic
triumph of Hariri's allies. Jumbalatt was one of the closest
friends of Hariri.
</P>
<P>
In Aley, another stronghold of the country's Druze minority,
members of Jumblatt's coalition also seized four seats, with only
one wrested by Talal Arslan, a descendant of Druze emir.
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise was witnessed in North Matn, where Nasib
Lahoud struggled to break through a defense line of the "National
Justice" coalition headed by Murr, Deputy Prime Minister and
Interior Minister, and overpassed one of the coalition's eight
members.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud and seven members of Murr's coalition took away the
eight seats of the constituency.
</P>
<P>
In Kasrwan, the uncovered support of Hariri's front led to
the winning of Mansour Ghanim Al-Bon, Rshaid Al-Khazen and Kamil
Zyad, while two other seats were captured by Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz and his coalition member Elias Al-Khazen. All the
five are incumbent deputies.
</P>
<P>
Opposition candidates complained that Hariri's all-powerful
fingers were not absent from Jbail, where two seats for Maronite
Catholics were obtained by Nouhad Al-Soaid and Emil Noufal and
the third for Shiite Moslem was netted by Mahmoud Awad.
</P>
<P>
Five out of the six seats of Baabda district were taken away by
the coalition of Elie Hobeika, another minister in Hariri's
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday race was held in a generally calm atmosphere,
except for a fierce war of words in which pro-government
candidates traded charges of bribery, intimidation and
gangsterism with their opponents.
</P>
<P>
Christians make up nearly 70 percent of Mount Lebanon's
656,000 voters and 25 of the governorate's 35 parliamentary seats
are reserved for the Christians.
</P>
<P>
The turnout, which was around 50 percent, was considerably
higher than in the last elections held in 1992, when most Christians
and many Moslems boycotted the polls in protest against an election
law and the continued presence of Syrian troops in the country.
</P>
<P>
One man was killed during Sunday's voting and police sources
said he died after a brawl at a polling station in the Druze area
of Schweifat, Chouf. The man was said to be a supporter of Talal
Arslan, Jumbalatt's Druze rival.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Resumption of Sino-Niger Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Chinese
Foreign Ministry today described the resumption of diplomatic
relations between China and Niger starting August 19 as a "major
event" in Sino-Niger relations.
</P>
<P>
Commenting in his talks on the resumption of diplomatic ties
between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Niger
through friendly discussions, spokesman Cui Tiankai said "we wish
to express, with great joy, our congratulations" on this event.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of China and Niger today signed a joint
communique concerning the restoration of diplomatic relations
between the two countries at the ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Niger are developing countries and they share
common ground in many fields, Cui said, adding that the
resumption of diplomatic ties accord to the fundamental and
long-term interests of the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cui noted that, with concerted efforts, the Sino-Niger friendly
and cooperative relations will have an all-round and rapid
restoration to the benefit of the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he added, the Taiwan Authorities have been
cashing in on the temporary economic difficulties that have plagued
some African countries to launch an energetic campaign of "elastic
and pragmatic diplomacy" and "dollar diplomacy," in an attempt to
gain "its diplomatic recognition" in return.
</P>
<P>
"These acts perpetrated by the Taiwan Authorities to split
China in disregard of overall national interests have met with
resolute opposition from the whole Chinese people, including the
Taiwan compatriots, and also with the resistance from the
overwhelming majority of African countries that uphold justice,
Cui said.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that such an attempt of Taiwan Authorities
has been futile, and is bound to failure, Cui noted. "Even if
their plot could work for a while, it will not succeed."

</P>
<P>
The nationwide protests came just before the government is to
announce its budget on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 people took part in a demonstration against
the coalition government in front of the federal parliament house
in the capital city of Canberra this afternoon. A number of
protesters and police officers were injured during clashes.
</P>
<P>
A glass door was smashed when scores of protesters tried to
force their way into the parliament house. Blood could be seen on
the doors and the floor of the main entrance.
</P>
<P>
Incidental brawls broke out between hundreds of protesters and
about 150 police officers during a 90-minute physical standoff at
the main entrance.
</P>
<P>
Protesters pressed hard to break police lines in front of the
doors and threw ink and paint at the police, but they were finally
pushed back away from the foyer. Dozens of people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Most of the protesters are trade union members, ethnic group
members and students from Canberra, News South Wales, Victoria and
Queensland. They rallied to protest against the government's plan
to reform industrial relations, lay out government employees and
cut funding for education and aboriginal communities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, similar demonstrations took place in other
major cities of the country, including Darwin, Adelaide and
Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
Over 10,000 people participated in a protest march to the state
parliament building in Brisbane, while 10,000 people took to the
streets in Adelaide. More than 500 people rallied in the Civic
Square in Darwin, the capital city of Northern Territory.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister John Howard stuck to the government's
plan to amend the Industrial Relation Law and cut eight billion
Australian dollars (6.24 billion US dollars) from the budget in
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he condemned the violence at the parliament house as
"unAustralian."
</P>
<P>
"I want to condemn utterly the violence that occurred today,
the attack on parliament house," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it very clear to those involved in that
violence, and to the Australian people, that never under any
circumstances will my government buckle to threats of physical
violence of behavior of that kind," he said after inspecting the
damages of the building.
</P>
<P>
The Howard government is expected to meet strong resistance
from the opposition Labor Party and other minor parties when
putting its budget and industrial relations reform proposals
through the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Kim Beazley told protesters in Canberra today that
the Opposition would do whatever it could to prevent the
government's industrial relations reform proposals from becoming
law.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Democrats and Greens also expressed their
opposition to the government's proposal to cut funding for social
welfare, employment and environmental programs.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Envisages Borderless ASEAN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia envisages a
borderless ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) in
future following the development of many economic growth areas in
the region, says Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
today.
</P>
<P>
The geographical border of member countries would become less
important in future as people would see ASEAN as a single entity,
he told reporters after opening the Commonwealth Geographical
Bureau's international conference on "vanishing borders: the new
international order of the 21st century" here.
</P>
<P>
There would be some amendments to legislations pertaining to
customs and immigration by participating countries of the growth
areas in order to facilitate a freer movement of capital, workers,
goods and tourists and this would contribute to a borderless
ASEAN, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We may come to a stage that member countries may have common
legislations for growth areas," he said, adding that this concept
would direct member countries to concentrate more on cooperation
to develop growth areas rather than border disputes.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines,
Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, and has Myanmar as its observer.
The countries are cooperating in developing several sub-regional
growth triangles.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said although border issues are still a problem, they
are not seen as an obstacle for member countries to continue their
cooperation, especially in developing growth areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Hundreds of sympathizers went to the Saint-Bernard Church in
Paris last weekend to show solidarity with the 300 African illegal
immigrants there, and to check police from launching another storm
into the church to forcibly evacuate the illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
-- A Belgian version of ``Silence of the Lambs'' has been made
public. Belgium was shocked by the discovery of a monstrous crime
in which a 40-year-old former metallurgical worker, Marc Doutroux,
kidnapped six little girls and butchered four of them. Some people
have called for the use of death penalty already outlawed in
Belgium, and some have threatened to lynch Doutroux.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The arrest of Marc Doutroux by Belgian police for kidnapping
and killing several little girls will lead to the discovery of a
network of criminal pedophiles in Europe. Doutrox has admitted
killing Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, both of them
eight-year-old, and Bernard Weinstein, one of his former
accomplice. Their bodies have been exhumed from the garden of one
of six houses owned by Doutroux. The wife and one of the
accomplice of Doutrox have also been arrested.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time in history, an international conference
against sexual abuse of children will be held on August 27-31 in
Stockholm. Organized by Sweden and some non-governmental
organizations, the conference will gather experts from around
world to propose measures to fight this evil.

<HEADLINE> Thai Gem Industry Looks to Tanzania for Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai jewelers will visit
Tanzania soon in the hope of finding a regular supplier of
gemstones, according to the Thai Gem and Jewelry Trades'
Association.
</P>
<P>
The association wants a central company to gather Tanzania
gemstones for allocation to its members, an arrangement similar to
that used to buy stones from Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
Talks would be held with the Tanzania government because it
preferred to export cut and polished stones which earned more than
sales of rough goods, an association source was quoted today by
local newspaper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
More Tanzania sapphires and rubies were being used in Thailand
because of their quality, the source said, adding Tanzania wanted
Thais to establish cutting plants locally but it lacked
gem-cutters.

GUANGZHOU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,450 contracts and
agreements were signed at the '96 Guangdong Foreign Trade and
Economic Fair that was held in Hong Kong early this month, a local
trade official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
These contracts were worth 8.6 billion US dollars in overseas

<HEADLINE> Dependents of US Army Personnel in Saudi Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of family members
of U.S. military personnel in Saudi Arabia have begun returning
to the United States under new security measures imposed after
two bombings, reports reaching here from Riyadh, Saudi capital,
said today.
</P>
<P>
"The move has started and it's ongoing," Samir Kouttab, a
senior diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said all of the first batchs of between 750 and 800 family
members of the U.S. military personnel would be home in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 U.S. security and military advisers, including
those who train the Saudi National Guard, are being moved to more
secure places on the outskirts of Riyadh, but most of their
families could not follow them because of lack of space and other
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, all the school-age children must return home, he
said, adding that the reason for the childrens' departure was not
because the American school in Riyadh has received threats.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said they cannot rule out more attacks on
American targets in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military authorities has also been proceeding with a
plan to move the 4,000 airforce personnel, who came to Saudi Arabia
without their families and stationed in more vulnerable bases in
Khobar, to the air base at Al-Kharj the south of Riyadh, where
an air-conditioned tent camp is being built and security measures
taken.
</P>
<P>
The new measures were imposed after a June 25 truck bomb
explosion, which killed 19 U.S. airmen and wounded hundreds of
other people at a military housing complex in Khobar.
</P>
<P>
Last November, five Americans and two Indians were killed when
a car bomb exploded outside the U.S. mission in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 U.S. military personnel and a large number of
U.S. businessman, professionals and workers are staying in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that very few families of U.S. diplomats in
the kingdom are likely to return home while no private
U.S. companies in Saudi Arabia had advised family members of their
staff to return to the United States for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
So far no official confirmation has been made about an earlier
report that six suspects involved in the June truck explosion
have been arrested.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Marks August Revolution Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese Party newspaper
"Nhan Dan" today calls upon the Vietnamese people to step up the
renovation process in the spirit of the August revolution 51 years
ago during which they toppled the French colonialists and their
feudal regime and won back national independence and freedom.
</P>
<P>
In a frontpage editorial, the Party newspaper said the August
revolution triumph affirms the leading role of the Communist Party
of Vietnam which rallied the entire people for the sacred cause of
national independence.
</P>
<P>
" The biggest lesson learned from the August revolution is our
Party's creative and steadfast leadership in rallying forces,
setting effective solutions, seizing opportunities, enhancing the
strength from national unity and satisfying the desire for
national liberation to gain independence and freedom for the
homeland and build a new decent and happy life for the people,"
the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said in circumstances similar to the August 1945
insurrection where opportunities and challenges were interweaved,
Vietnam is confronting many problems to be solved such as
developing a multi-sectoral commodity economy in a market
mechanism under socialist-oriented state management, accelerating
national industrialization and modernization for the final
objective of a strong country, a wealthy people and an equitable
and civilized society.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the editorial added, " The entire Prty and people
are required to strive their best, fully utilise the will of
self-reliance and apply all lessons from the Agust revolution in a
creative way to carry out national construction and defence in the
new stage successfully."

BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The American blockbuster
"Waterworld" will hit Beijing's cinemas on August 23, film
distributors say.
</P>
<P>
The movie, the most expensive ever made, is expected to bring
new profits to China's sluggish film industry, with dozens of
billboards having been put up in public places to woo fans.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers are also pushing the lavish Hollywood product in
various articles.
</P>
<P>
Sci-fi films, such as "Superman", have enjoyed a good reception
with Chinese audiences in the past, generating big box receipts.
</P>
<P>
The film is set in a future world where cities have all been
covered by flood waters, and men and women have to struggle for
survival, often against evil forces.
</P>
<P>
A local Chinese film studio will distribute the movie and
share profits with the US side.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the state China Film Export and Import Corporation
monopolized the distribution of all foreign films. But according
to a new regulation issued this year, three local film studios
have import rights.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Grandparents Become Parents Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- More grandparents in Shanghai,
China's largest city, are playing the role of parents to their
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
At least one out of every six school children in Shanghai are
taken care of by Grandma and Grandpa.
</P>
<P>
The absence of parents from home became the first reason
causing the change. Many of the children's parents do not work in
Shanghai. In 1966-1976 (the Cultural Revolution), over one million
middle school graduates, known as "educated youth," were
encouraged to receive practice in remote boundary areas,
mountainous or rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Shanghai educated young people returned to Shanghai
after the Cultural Revolution. Those who remained far away from
home decided to send back their children to Shanghai. They
considered that the educational and living conditions were better
than in their adopted towns and cities. One couple was allowed by
policies to return one child.
</P>
<P>
These children were sent to a strange "hometown" without
parents at home, and most often the grandparents started to play
the role of parents again.
</P>
<P>
When divorced people remarried, or young couples went abroad
for further training, even more grandparents became "acting
parents".
</P>
<P>
Some divorced people would ask their children from their
previous marriage to stay with their grandparents, not with the
new wife or husband to avoid family conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists have noticed the negative influence of the family
education role by the grandparents. The over-burdened grandparents
experienced strong spiritual stresses. Meanwhile, children without
parental guidance and comfort are more prone to psychological

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dispute on Hebron Redeployment Continues (By Wang Yukui) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The dispute on the Israeli
army's redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron continues,
as the settlement activists are planning to launch a public
campaign against a new redeploying proposal, which they said
is little different from that of the previous Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Jewish communities in Hebron and Kiryat
Arba, a settlement just outside of Hebron, and various right-wing
activist groups held a meeting late Sunday night to formulate the
campaign, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The settlers' move came after Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and the inner cabinet convened Sunday to debate the new
redeployment proposal, but failed to reach any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
The new plan was prepared by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai with a proposal to change the Oslo accords with regard
to the extent of the Palestinian control in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) would
only gain civilian control over the area, and overriding security
control would remain in the Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the Israeli army is to pull
back from approximately 80 percent of Hebron, leaving all Arab
neighborhoods of the town under full PNA control, which is
designated as Area A.
</P>
<P>
However, under the new proposal, Hebron would no longer be
designated as Area A, but part of Area B, an area of shared
control by the two sides, where the Israeli army can move freely
as it deems necessary for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to Mordechai, the plan provides the best possible
security for settlers in the disputed West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
However, several ministers, including National Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon who reportedly has been serving as a
go-between for the settlers and the cabinet, have disputed
various aspects of the plan.
</P>
<P>
Before the inner cabinet meeting Sunday, Sharon made a
surprise visit to Hebron, where he toured several sites, and the
settlers told him they were concerned that there would not be a
way to prevent Palestinian attacks if the Israeli army redeploys.
</P>
<P>
Settler organizations plan to increase pressure on all
ministers, including those who have already come out against
redeploying from the Arab neighborhoods of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Noam Arnon, spokesman for the Jewish community in Hebron, said
the goal of settlers' meeting Sunday night was to plan "widespread
public activity to put pressure on the government."
</P>
<P>
While the community has not yet been shown a copy of
Mordechai's plan, both press reports and hints from the
government officials lead the settlers to believe that it is very
similar to the previous government's, with the addition of what
several termed "cosmetic changes."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Dispute on Hebron Redeployment Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"These cosmetic changes certainly do not supply security,"
said Gershon Bar-Kochva, a member of the residents'
political-security committee, in an interview with Arutz 7, a
right-wing radio station.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Kochva said the security flaws will affect not just Hebron
residents, but also the rest of the country, since Hebron is a
stronghold of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, the planned dividing line between the
Israeli army and the PNA in the city runs through houses and
crowded streets, and will therefore be completely unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
Arnon said another issue of great concern to the residents is
that under the new plan, Hebron's Jews would be dependent on the
PNA for everything from water to building permits once the
Israeli army withdraws.
</P>
<P>
He said this issue was the main focus of Sharon's visit
Sunday, and he also argued that "the government has no mandate to
do this."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Palestinian officials, who had to accept a
delay in the implementation of the Hebron redeployment, have
repeatedly said that they would not renegotiate any signed
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Queria
stressed that the Palestinians would not open new negotiations on
the Hebron issue, demanding the Israeli troops to pull out in
accordance with the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe also said that the Palestinians
would not agree to Israeli troop patrols in the Arab
neighborhoods as part of an Israeli redeployment in the city.
</P>
<P>
Natshe said the negotiations on Hebron took into account the
security need of the Jewish residents in the town, warning that
any changes in the original redeployment plan will be violation of
the interim accord.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was
originally supposed to pullback from Hebron by March 28, but,
following a series of suicide bombing attacks, former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres made a decision to postpone the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the May
29 general elections, citing security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by Likud Chairman Netanyahu in the
elections, said afterwards that he would leave the decision of the
redeployment to the new prime minister and his government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 40 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a place
of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Muslims alike, and
tradition has it that patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their
wives are all buried in the Machpelah Cave (Haram al-Khalil).
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the center of
Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish neighborhood
after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over the town from
the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 200,000 Palestinians living in most other
parts of the city, surrounding the Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu said that he would like
to have Hebron dealt as part of the final status arrangements with
the Palestinians, but, at the same time, he also said he would
stand by the international agreements.
</P>
<P>
So far, Netanyahu has repeatedly said he has been studying the
issue of the redeployment in Hebron, but giving no date when he
would make the final decision.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, American sources revealed that the Israeli
premier, during his first official visit to the U.S., told
President Bill Clinton at their private meeting that he would
seek a way to implement the redeployment in Hebron.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Harnesses Largest River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Rongjiang River, the largest
in eastern Guangdong Province, has recently been tamed after a
decade of work.
</P>
<P>
The 175-km-long river runs through five cities and counties,
over an area of 4,400 sq. km. It used to be the principal source
of floods in Guangdong because of the lack of a flood-control
system on the upper riches.
</P>
<P>
Since it was listed at the top of the province's agenda in
1986, 281 million yuan in investment have been put into the
project. Local people have built two reservoirs, rebuilt 135
culvert gates, reinforced embankments along 300 km, and improved
209 sq. km of eroded soil.
</P>
<P>
This year, Jieyang city had a record in the amount of early
crops harvested, as a result of these efforts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Reform Party Nominee Launches Presidential Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Reform Party's
presidential nominee Ross Perot launched his second presidential
campaign on Sunday night by declaring that he was committed to
passing a better world to the coming generations.
</P>
<P>
"I will only belong to you, the people, and I am absolutely
committed, irrevocably committed to passing on a better world to
our children and our grandchildren," Perot said in accepting the
Reform Party nomination at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
The newly formed third party in the United States selected the
Texas billionaire as its first-ever presidential candidate by
casting votes by mail, telephone and computer on the internet. The
result was announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Perot said he would talk of the hard issues, unlike President
Bill Clinton who, he maintained, only says, "I feel your pain."
</P>
<P>
"If you want them to feel your pain, let them have retirement
and health insurance like yours," Perot said.
</P>
<P>
Like in the 1992 campaign, Perot stressed in his speech the
nation's debt and job issues.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the Republicans' economic plan that combines
a tax cut and supply-side economics.
</P>
<P>
After he addressed about 2,000 supporters at the convention,
Perot said he would not bankroll his campaign from his personal
fortune as in 1992, but would rely on federal funding and private
contributions.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Elections Commission has said the Reform Party was
eligible to receive 29.2 million U.S. dollars in federal matching
funds.
</P>
<P>
Perot's campaign funding plan would limit him to spending
50,000 dollars of his own money. In 1992, when he campaigned as an
independent for presidency, he spent 70 million dollars largely
from his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
Perot, expected to choose a running mate in a few days, will
face an uphill battle. A Newsweek magazine poll released on
Saturday showed that he would only win 3 percent of the vote in a
three-way race with Republican Bob Dole and Democrat President
Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Children Suffer Most From Parents' Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Children are hurt the most as a
result of their parents' divorce in Vietnam, according to a recent
survey.
</P>
<P>
Statisitics by Ho Chi Minh city's municipal court said over
31,000 couples divorced in 1991-1995, marking a 45 percent
increase from the preceding five-year period.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, there were 5,934 divorces against 15,918
marriages, which means two couples separated for every five
marriages.
</P>
<P>
Statistics revealed that most divorced couples are between 30
and 50 years of age and have one or two children. More than
two-thirds of broken families were public servants and workers,
where both husband and wife were fairly well educated.
</P>
<P>
" Women are now fully aware of the value of family
happiness. They no longer accept inequality between men and
women", said the chairperson of the Municipal Women's Union,
explaining the tendency for divorce among women.
</P>
<P>
Children appear to suffer the most in broken
families. Criminologists said more than one third of juvenile
delinquents came from broken homes, and about 60 percent of
children from divorced families display certain mental and
emotional conditions resulting from violent actions between their
parents.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Coffee Exports Shoot Up by 46.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua)-- Uganda's coffee exports shot up
by 46.6 percent from 184,121 bags (60 kilos per bag) in June to
269,990 bags in July this year, reported the locl daily the New
Vision today.
</P>
<P>
The value of the coffee exports also went up by 40 percent
from 17.4 million US Dollars to 24.4 million during the same
period, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the same period last year, there was a rise of
43.9 percent and 1.2 percent in volume and value respectively,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in volume and value of coffee exports in July is
attributed to increased supply of coffee from the southwestern
region, where a spell of sunshine has accelerated the drying of
coffee.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the increase is due to the removal of the
controversial coffee stabilization tax on june 15 this year by
the minister of finance in his budget speech to parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government had abolished the tax due to
declining coffee prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The tax was introduced in 1994 to control the exchange rate
against large inflows of foreign exchange due to high coffee
prices.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is the number one foreign exchange earner in Uganda,
the second largest coffee exporter in Africa after Cote d'Ivoire.

<HEADLINE> Diverse Production Helps Hezhen People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The approximately 4,000 Hezhen
people, members of China's smallest minority group, living near
the Heilongjiang and Wusuli rivers in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province, are changing from fishing and hunting to
diversified production, including growing crops and breeding
livestock.
</P>
<P>
With decreasing fishery resources, the Hezhen people could not
improve their living standard very well, but the market economy in
China has helped make development possible.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of the local government, the Hezhen people
gradually gave up their traditional simple production methods a
few years ago, and began a range of production in crop
cultivation, forest products, animal husbandry, side-line
products, and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the local government has been helping
them with funds, materials, and techniques, as well as flexible
policies. Those in the suburbs of Tongjiang City are exempt from
taxes for three years on wasteland they have reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Last year the city government there raised more than 700,000
yuan for the Hezhen to expand farming.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they reclaimed 800 hectares of wasteland and
raised more than 200 cows, 400 lambs, and 500 pigs. They also
built ponds with a combined water surface of more than 100
hectares for breeding 170,000 fish.

In Bacha, a village in Tongjiang, the Hezhen grew crops on more
than 3,000 mu last year, and agricultural production and fish
breeding were worth 750,000 yuan in 1995, 15,000 times that of
fisheries. The per-capita net income was 1,750 yuan, 2.6 times the
amount for 1994.
</P>
<P>
Fu Tiejun, head of Jiejinkou Village, reclaimed 200 hectares of
wasteland together with ten other villagers last year, earning
them 100,000 yuan from sales of 150,000 kilograms of soya beans.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Hezhen villagers have raised funds to buy
farm machinery and have reclaimed 400 hectares of wasteland.
</P>
<P>
The government of Raohe County by the Wusuli River has helped
the Hezhen people of Sipai Village raise about one million yuan
for reclamation of wasteland and breeding domestic animals and
fish. The county Water Conservation Department has helped them
build more than 600 hectares of irrigated land and reclaim more
than 260 hectares of paddy fields.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Hezhen people have supplied one million kg of
rice to the market annually, quite a change from depending on
grain supply from the government.
</P>
<P>
You Minjie, 51, led a hard life several years ago, but since
1994, has earned about 10,000 to 20,000 yuan a year from his 73
hectares of paddy rice fields and fish ponds.
</P>
<P>
Twenty other families in the village have become better-off by
growing crops and breeding domestic animals and fish. This year
the village has raised 300,000 yuan to build a rice processing
mill, which can earn more than 200,000 yuan a year. Enitem

<P>
HONG KONG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate of Hong Kong for the May - July period was 2.9
percent, much lower than the 3.1 percent recorded for the April -
June period, according to official figures released today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest figures, a government spokesman said
labor market conditions continued to improve in recent months. In
particular, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell below
three percent for the first time in the past 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Decreases in the unemployment rate were mainly observed in the
wholesale, retail, import and export trades and transport sectors,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the growth rate of total labor supply coming
down to a level close to the growth rate of total employment, and
with the latter's growth continuing to be robust, this also helped
to lower the overall unemployment rate.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Research to Be Coodinated in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Coffee research will be
coordinated and upgrated in Uganda, the New Vision newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Director of Kituza Coffee Research Center Peter Ngategize said
last Friday that his organisation will coordinate research on
coffee and other tropical crops such as cocoa, oil palm tree and
tea so as to boost production.
</P>
<P>
But he underlined that Ugandan scientists will focus their
efforts on coffee diseases because it is the major export crop in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Tracheomycosis, a devastating disease of coffee, broke out
earlier this month in Kiboga, 110 kilometers northwest from
Kampala. It can be spread from one plant to another by rain
water, soil and human activities such as transportation of the
infected plants.
</P>
<P>
Since the breakaway of the East African Community in 1977,
there had been no serious research on these crops, Ngategize
said.
</P>
<P>
The leading scientist also revealed that Ugandan researchers
also tried to use some survived coffee strains to develop new
varieties resistant to tracheomycosis. enditem

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Adviser Discounts Chance of War with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's foreign policy adviser Dore Gold has dismissed a
suggestion that the current government's policy increases chance
of war with Syria, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gold made the remarks here Sunday night while referring to a
press report that the hardline Likud government has, by making it
clear it will not agree to a full Golan withdrawal, created a
greater prospect that Syria will initiate a war -- even if the
prospects for winning are slimmer that in the past.
</P>
<P>
In an article in Sunday's Ha'aretz newspaper, Professor Ze'ev
Maoz, Head of Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies, urged the prime minister to prepare the public for the
possibility of war in the "not too long distant future," so long
as he continues his current policy course.
</P>
<P>
Refuting Maoz's assessment, Gold argued that this government
had been "careful not to put Syrian President Hafez Assad in
a corner, so that he is left with no other choice but a
military option."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the government "has not closed the door
to further negotiations with Syria besides 'Lebanon First.'"
</P>
<P>
Maoz said that it would be wrong to assume that Syria's
decision to start a war would be determined by the military
balance, which is tipped towards Israel due to a variety of
reasons, including the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Rather,
Damascus may decide, like Cairo did in 1973, that a limited
war could have a decisive psychological impact in breaking the
diplomatic stalemate, thereby helping it win back territory.
</P>
<P>
He said that unlike the Yom Kippur War, the casualties might be
civilians who live within the range of Syria's Scud-C missiles. He
predicted that the Syrians might be willing to take such a risk
even if it knows that the inevitable counterstrike would be very
punishing.
</P>
<P>
Maoz stressed that the prospects of war with Syria had dropped
during the tenure of the Labor government, when it appeared there
might be a breakthrough in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The main meaning of the diplomatic about-face on the Syrian
track is a considerable increase in the probability of war with
Syria and perhaps additional Arab elements," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Maoz described the Likud notion of "peace with the Golan"
as a "fantasy".

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Subway Project On Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The first line of 12.7 billion
yuan (1.5 billion US dollars) subway in south China's Guangzhou is
on target to open on July 1st next year.
</P>
<P>
Bidding for equipment for the underground rail link has ended
and contracts signed for the import of apparatus.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 4.316 billion Yuan (500 million US dollars)
has been poured into the project and another 3.5 billion Yuan (430
million US dollars) is earmarked for investment this year.
</P>
<P>
Owing to shrinking real estate activity in Guangzhou, however,
the plan to collect funds through real estate development has not
realized as expected.
</P>
<P>
"But we will make every effort to complete the project as
scheduled," said an official, "We welcome funds from all channels
to join us, both from home and abroad", he added.
</P>
<P>
The first part of the subway will open on July 1 next year, the
official assured. Meanwhile with the completion of underground
work along the first stretch, surface road works is underway to
restore city streets to normal after the upheaval of subway
contract work. The aim is to restore a good environment in time
for a crucial autumn meeting of city leaders from the Asia-Pacific
region.

<P>
KUNMING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
province has announced that it will participate in multi-national
development efforts on the Lancang (Mekong) River.
</P>

its agenda in its 1996-2000 development program.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Yunnan listed some 100 projects for multi-national

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Continues Searching for Missing Fishermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's navy and coast guards
today continued combing waters off the coast of Thanh Hoa Province
to search for fishermen still missing after whirlwind and
associated tropical storms hit the area last wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The disaster left Thanh Hoa, 100 km south of Hanoi, with at
least 95 fishermen dead and another 519 missing.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Central Committee for Flood and
Storm Control, the search for survivors was carried out despite
the rough seas in what was described as the worst disaster since
1989 when a storm killed 740 people.
</P>
<P>
The official added by last Friday noon, 614 fishermen out of a
total number of 1,785 who were fishing offshore had not returned.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the big number of missing fishermen to the
absence of effective radio communications among them.
</P>
<P>
Also in Thanh Hoa province, the disaster had left as many as
15,000 people homeless, with almost all rice fields and villages
along the coast submerged in deep water.
</P>
<P>
By this time, a third level flood warning was issued for Hanoi
while provinces south of here have been alarmed of new possible
flooding.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti oil workers urged
the government to start an investigation into an incident of
ammonia gas leakage from Iraqi oil installations, which spread to
Kuwait through across its the northern borders.
</P>
<P>
The Oil Workers Union said in a statement Sunday that "we
appeal to all concerned officials especially the security
authorities to launch a probe into the incident to find out its
causes."
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight workers of the Kuwait Oil Company suffered from
severe suffocation caused by the leakage from the Iraqi oil
installations located near the Kuwaiti border Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The workers were suffocated while busy in digging a new oil
well in northern Kuwait, the digging started in late July in
accordance with the 1993 United Nations demarcation of the
border. Nobody died from the suffocation.
</P>
<P>
Official sources indicated that the leakage was most likely
related to some technical preparations by the Iraqis to
re-operate their installations and resume oil production.
</P>
<P>
The union's secretary Ismail Al-Kundari said the leakage should
 not be taken as incidental.
</P>
<P>
"We should believe the assumption that the leakage was
coincidental. The incident should be dealt with in great
caution and suspicion because it involves Iraq," he said.

704,989 containers which was also a record for a seven
month-period, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Colombo port's record performance was
possible because of the experienced and trained employees of the
port and the installation of new equipment last year.
</P>
<P>
The efficient handling of containers had resulted in the
increase of transshipment activity by 17.4 percent during the
first six months of the year as compared with the same period of
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of container ships calling at the Colombo port also
increased by 12 percent while the total containerized cargo was up
by 12.6 percent during the first six months of this year compared
with the same period of last year, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Road to Africa's Goal of "Education for All" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addis Ababa, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The resolution declaring
1996 the "year of education in Africa" is right when it stresses that
attaining the goal of "toward education for all" constitutes the
cornerstone of African economic development.
</P>
<P>
The goal of "toward education for all" in Africa was set out
in the resolution adopted by the Ministerial Council of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) here a year ago and it is an
obejctive for all the African countries to attain in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
It is a bright idea indeed but the road toward its attainment
would be far from easy.
</P>
<P>
A Pan-African seminar held in Bamako, Mali, recently also
discussed the theme of "toward education for all" and made
recommendations on the subject.
</P>
<P>
African countries have attached importance to developing
education in the past decades since independence and their
achievements gained so far cannot be written off.
</P>
<P>
The rate of illiteracy in the African continent is declining
year by year after independence.
</P>
<P>
African countries have trained their own intellectuals and
technicians who have become mainstay of their national
construction.
</P>
<P>
What is more, many African countries have carried out and are
carrying out educational reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of African education is by no means
smooth and even.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, one of the challenges to African education is that
public spending is not enough in face of the needs.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNESCO, public expenditure on education in
sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the public expenditure on education in the
sub-Saharan region was only 16 billion US Dollars, 28 percent and
26 percent of those Latin America and southern Asia spent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In some African countries, there is practically no fund for
primary education from the central government except for
teachers' salaries and allowances.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, even though the total enrolment of students at the
primary level has been on the increase, gross enrolment rates
have steadily declined.
</P>
<P>
For example, the number of enrolment students at primary level
in sub-Sahara is 86.1 million in 1992, 22 million and 6.6 million
more than the year of 1980 and 1990 respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the gross enrolment rate in 1992 was 74.3 percent
compared with 79.2 percent in 1980. According to the UNESCO, the
gross enrolment rate will further decline to 71.7 percent by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the middle and high level education in the
continent is also facing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the number of adult illiterates in sub-Saharan Africa
is on the increase. According to statistics, the estimated
adult illiteracy rate aged 15 years and over dropped to 43.2
percent in 1995 from 59.8 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the rate will decline to 38 percent by
the year 2000. But, the number of absolutely illiterate adults
in the region is still increasing rapidly and is projected to
reach 146.8 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Development of African education is vital and will have
important bearing on African development in the future.
</P>
<P>
African leaders attending the Yaounde 32nd OAU summit last
month discussed the education situation in Africa and adopted a
"resolution on the launching of the decade of education in Africa
(1997-2006)".
</P>
<P>
The resolution stressed that the main objective of the "decade
of education in Africa" would be to remove obstacles to progress
toward education for all.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated the urgent need for sub-regional and regional
cooperation in order to harness the potentials and experience of
its member states in the area of education.
</P>
<P>
The resolution expressed African leaders' determination to
develop African education and to attain the goal of "toward
education for all" by the year 2006.
</P>
<P>
It is a very good idea but the road toward it will be long and
arduous, observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Runs into Power Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Fast industrial development and
lower levels in the Yellow River have made power-affluent Ningxia
in north China short of electricity this year, local officials
said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, although the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region generated 2.7 percent more power than the same
period last year, the local power grid suffered a shortage of
electricity of up to 200,000 kilowatt hours a day at times.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of power has been caused by the rapid growth of
energy-consuming, raw material and processing
industries. Energy-consuming industries in Ningxia, which have
developed at an annual growth rate of 20 percent for years, use
more than 60 percent of the region's electricity.
</P>
<P>
Among the five autonomous regions in China, Ningxia was the
first to provide electricity to every household in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
In this May, Ningxia started the country's biggest poverty
elimination project, a scheme to divert water from the Yellow
River for irrigation for one million poor people in the
mountainous area. The move has worsened the power supply situation.
</P>
<P>
This year, water levels in the Yellow River were excessively
low, and this affected power output.
</P>
<P>
At present, Ningxia's installed capacity has risen to 1.6
million kwh, ranking second in the country. From 1990 to 1995 the
region exported to the Northwest Power Grid and its adjacent
provinces or regions up to five billion kilowatt hours.
</P>
<P>
In August, however, Ningxia has for the first time imported
electricity from the Northwest Power Grid, officials with the
regional power bureau said.
</P>
<P>
In order to ease power shortages in the first half of this year,
they also revealed, the region has cut electricity exports to
other parts of China by 36 percent. But this was offset by a 14.3
percent growth of local industrial demand on electricity.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that in Ningxia's transition from surplus to
insufficiency in electric power supply indicated the progress of
society in the populous region of the Hui minority group.

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A driverless train engine
traveled about 110 kilometers in India's Andhra Pradesh Saturday
evening without causing any casualties and serious damages, The
Indian Express said today.
</P>
<P>
The driver and the diesel operator of the engine got down at
the town of Mirzapalli in the Southern Indian state at about 10:30
p.m. local time Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, the engine started moving on its own and
picked up speed much to the surprise of the engine driver.
</P>
<P>
The engine at a speed of 80 kilometers an hour continued its
journey towards the city of Nizamabad in the north of Andhra
Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The driver immediately alerted the station master, who in turn
informed his superiors and all stations on the
Mirzapalli-Nizamabad route.
</P>
<P>
The railway authorities finally managed to stop the runaway
train engine near the Nizamabad railway station by putting logs
and iron rods across the track.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Half-Year Tax Revenue up 41.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The local tax bureau of the
Chinese capital collected 6.54 billion yuan (about 790 million US
dollars) in taxes in the first six months of this year, up 41.3
percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The amount represents 58.8 percent of this year's target, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the city's industrial and commercial tax revenue
has grown steadily since the start of this year, with the
quarterly average rising 780 million yuan over a year ago to a new
high of 2.75 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that consumption tax revenue rose 40.7
percent year-on-year to 3.27 billion yuan during the January-June
period, while the corporate income tax revenue was up 36.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the steady growth in tax revenue to a
sustained, rapid and healthy development of local economy and an
increase in the number of tax resources.
</P>
<P>
The majority of new tax payers are in the industrial,
commercial, transport, construction, tourism and service sectors,
the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Three-Fourths of Significant Section of "Modern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Highways Authority
has announced that by now 81.78 percent of the
Tarsus-Adana-Gaziantep section, the most significant part of
Turkey's "modern silk road," has been completed, local newspaper
Daily News said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the completed is the key section of a
1,312-kilometer trans-Turkey expressway West-to-East, which will
revive the ancient Silk Road when totally completed.
</P>
<P>
Work on the 258-kilometer Tarsus-Adana-Gaziantep road began in
1987 and so far 211 kilometers of it have been completed and put
into use.
</P>
<P>
The Tarsus-Adana-Gaziantep expressway is to be completed by
December 31, 1998, at the cost of 1.227 billion U.S. dollars. Its
completion is important for the country's giant Southeastern
Anatolia project (GAP) project because the new expressway will
provide easier access between Central Anatolia and the GAP region
in the Southeast via Cukurova region.
</P>
<P>
It will make it easier for the people of the South and the
Southeast to transport their industrial and agricultural products
not only to other parts of the country but also to world markets
by way of the Iskenderun and Mersin ports as well as the
Toros-Adana-Yumurtalik free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
Turkey launched the ambitious GAP in the late 1960s, which
will be completed in 2005. The 30 billion U.S. dollars project
covers the construction of 22 dams, 19 hydro-electric power plants
and two large irrigation tunnels aimed mainly at developing
agriculture in southeast Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China City Reviving Small State-Owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbin, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Harbin, capital city of northeast
China's Heilongjiang province, has been fruitful in reinvigorating
local small state-owned enterprises through property right reforms.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Zhu Shengwen told Xinhua that the reform has been
conducted in 3,569 of the city's 4,300-plus small state firms
since 1992. Most of the local small state-owned companies were
running at a loss, or were in debt.
</P>
<P>
To revive the firms, some have been leased to individuals; some
have been turned into stock companies; some have been divided into
even smaller units.
</P>
<P>
While carrying out the reforms, the city has been very careful
in handling the future of 160,000 workers or unemployed workers to
ensure social stability.
</P>
<P>
The reform has proved a success as the companies have increased
their production value and pretax profits by 2.6 times and 2.1
folds respectively.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the reform, the city has increased its GNP and
revenue by 11 percent and 26 percent respectively, the deputy
mayor noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the state property of small
state-owned firms has climbed by over 400 million yuan, while the
debt ratio of the state property has declined from 82 percent in
1993 to the present 74 percent.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate to Be Under Five Percent In Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Central Bank Governor
(CBK) Micah Cheserem has predicted that the country's inflation
rate will decline to between zero and five percent from next
year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing guests at the "Made in India" show in Nairobi at
the weekend, the CBK boss said Kenya's economy is better than
those in many other countries, adding that the bright economic
prospects should be taken advantage of by foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He said appropriate fiscal and monetary policies will be put
in place to ensure that the inflation is contained at low levels
for the good of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Micah Cheserem said this is under the government's main
monetary policy objective of containing inflation at single
digit.
</P>
<P>
The CBK governor said large Shilling exchange rate associated
with major economic reforms of 1993-95 are unlikely to be
repeated, adding that the shilling's exchange rate will largely
be left to be determined by market forces of demand and supply.
</P>

<HEADLINE> South Korea, U.S. Start Annual Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United States
today began their 12-day annual command post exercise, "Ulchi
Focus Lens (UFL)."
</P>
<P>
The drill, which is a kind of map exercise using computer war
game programs without the mobilization of troops, will involve
military units of army corps, naval fleet and air force wing-class
and above on the South Korean side.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. side, some 15,000 American troops are expected to
participate.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The exercise is designed to evaluate and improve coordination
procedures, plans and systems necessary for the conduct of
contingency operations of the two countries on the Korean
Peninsula, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
As part of the UFL, a national emergency drill, "Ulchi
Exercise '96," also started throughout South Korea today.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day exercise, government offices across the
country involving all government administrative units will hold
emergency meetings, trainings and other drills under mock crisis
situations to test the nation's crisis management readiness.
</P>
<P>
Power outages and other mock-up contingencies will be staged
area by area at night or during time slots when inconveniences are
least expected. Tap water supply will be suspended for three to
four hours in one area after another in 34 regions across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "sippuje," or an anti-traffic congestion formula
that forces private cars to remain parked one in every 10 days,
will be enforced in 20 cites and areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, midnight curfews, abolished in early 1982, will be
briefly revived in 13 cities and regions and are expected to
affect entertainment spots during the operation hours.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic element of the national emergency drill is an
unscheduled anti-air attack exercise that will be conducted
nationwide at an unfixed time on August 21.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the U.S. used to hold the UFL annually from
1976 to 1990, but separated the UFL into two smaller exercises,
Ulchi and Focus lens, from 1991 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, however, decided to combine the two
exercises in 1994 due to the judgement that the separation of the
two exercises lowered the efficiency of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has condemned the
South Korea-U.S. exercise, which it described as "military
provocations" to the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Transportation System Gets More Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The number of passengers
travelling by train in China this summer will drop 4.2 percent
over the same period of last year, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-July period, the country's railway carried an
average of 2.57 million passengers every day, a drop of 15.9
percent (about 487,000 passengers) over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the decline of railway passengers to two
factors. The main factor was the 51 percent lift in railway ticket
prices last October, which caused a total decline of at least 42
million passengers in the last quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is the fast growing highway and air
transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), the country's
highway network saw passengers increase by 55 percent. While air
passengers have increased annually by 20 percent since 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 private
research institutes in east China's Zhejiang Province have played
an important role in promoting economic development for
farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The first private institute was set up three years ago by a
college graduate who quit his job at a state-run enterprise.
</P>
<P>
His institute specializes in the research of sea food
breeding. He persuaded local fishermen to engage themselves in sea
food cultivation and provided them with breeding technology to
enable them to become well-off.
</P>
<P>
Many such institutes in Zhejiang have conducted practical
research projects on cultivation and agriculture, such as
processing for vegetables and mushrooms, pig farming, prevention
and control of animal diseases, livestock breeding, and
feed-processing.
</P>
<P>
To help local farmers learn more science and technology, the
institutes also invited many agricultural Chinese scholars and
foreign experts to lecture on agro-sciences.

<HEADLINE> India May Allow Higher Holding of Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign institutional
investors (FIIs) may be allowed to increase their stake beyond 24
percent in individual joint venture companies in India, The Times
of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
FIIs have been lobbying for permission to hold higher stakes in
certain Indian blue chips in which they have already reached the
24 percent limit. However, the corporate sector in India is
divided over the desirability of an increased FII presence.
</P>
<P>
Certain Indian companies, mainly those who are not worried
about hostile takeover attempts, have indicated to the government
that they are not averse to a higher FII holding. On the other
hand, several family controlled corporate groups with low
controlling stakes are completely against a higher FII holding.
</P>
<P>
Sources for the Indian Finance Ministry said the ministry may
permit FII holding to go up to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, a higher FII presence will have to be cleared by the
board of directors of each company which may also be allowed to
decide the extent of such holding, the sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Benxi, an industrial city in
northeastern province of Liaoning, was once known as "a city
that could not be seen by astronauts from space".
</P>
<P>
Thanks to hard efforts by the city over the past eight years,
Benxi has become much cleaner, with the quality of both its
atmosphere and water up to national standards.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the State Council Environmental Protection Commission
put Benxi under a comprehensive environmental pollution control
program.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the city has invested 480 million yuan in the
program, which included 44 projects carried out in three phases.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 94 facilities have been set up in the city, which
has been able to cut 147,000 tons of dust of various kinds, 9,000
tons of carbon dioxide, and 9.12 million tons of polluted water.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts have been made to put a large quantity of
coal-refuse disposed at a local stockyard under control.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the city is
expected to invest another 2.28 billion yuan into 65 projects to
improve the local environment even further.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation declined by 0.19 percentage points to 5.14 percent for
the week that ended on August 3 after four weeks of unabated rise,
spurred mainly by the hike in petroleum product prices, The
Financial Express said today.
</P>
<P>
The rate stood at 8.2 percent for the corresponding period of
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The decline in inflation was attributed to fall in prices of
commodities such as coffee, coconut and salt. The week under
review, however, also saw a rise in prices of rice, wheat and
eggs.
</P>
<P>
This is the 71st week in succession that inflation has veered
around single digit level.

<P>
DHAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has submitted a memorandum to the
government in a protest against what they called terrorism,
torture and repression on the party's leaders and workers across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, which was submitted to Home Minister Rafiqul
Islam Sunday, alleged that about 50 BNP leaders and workers were
killed, several thousands others injured and several hundreds
arrested or forced to leave their homes in the past one and a half
months.
</P>
<P>
In some places, houses of BNP leaders and workers were looted
and set on fire, it said, adding that women were physically abused
and a large sum of money was forcibly collected as toll from the
businessmen who support the BNP.
</P>
<P>
The BNP demanded immediate arrest of those responsible for the
killing, looting, arson, ransacking and other terrorist activities
and stern legal actions against them.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Develop Hydropower with Private Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Nepal is working on a strategy
to develop its abundant water resources through local and foreign
private investments, Water Resources Minister Pashupati Rana said.
</P>
<P>
Rana, while addressing the 11th anniversary program of the
Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) here Sunday, said that small,
medium and large-sized hydro projects will be launched in Nepal by
mobilizing domestic resources, international assistance and
private investment.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government will adopt a policy to
encourage local and foreign involvement in hydropower generation.
</P>
<P>
On the disputed 6,480-megawatt Pancheshwar project on Nepal's
western Mahakali border river with India, the minister said that
it is to be built at an outlay of 450 US dollars per kilowatt,
compared to small and medium-sized projects, which often cost 650
to 2,000 dollars per kilowatt.
</P>
<P>
The Pancheshwar project, which was laid down under a
Nepal-India treaty on the Mahakali border river development signed
earlier this year, has been regarded by local resistance groups as
too big and expensive for Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali treaty provides principles for sharing of cost and
benefits of the Pancheshwar project between Nepal and India on an
equitable basis.
</P>
<P>
Nepal hopes to export its share of power supply in the project
to India, which is facing an acute power supply deficit because of
the rapid industrial development.

<HEADLINE> Australian Imports Continue To Fall In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian economy showed
further signs of slowing down as merchandise imports in July
continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported today that
merchandise imports fell by three percent to 6.15 billion
Australian dollars (4.80 billion US dollars) in July over the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive monthly fall of imports,
indicating that a reduced economic growth rate had led to a
decline in demands for import goods.
</P>
<P>
The July imports were at the lowest level since October last
year.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise imports fell by five percent to 6.32 billion
Australian dollars (4.93 billion US dollars) in June.
</P>
<P>
Diminished imports will help to further reduce the current
account deficit, which is one of the country's major economic
headaches.
</P>
<P>
Monthly current account deficit has shrunk to 1.3 billion
Australian dollars (1.0 billion US dollars) in June from its peak
level of 2.1 billion Australian dollars (1.6 billion US dollars)
in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit figure is expect to be reduced
further in July.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Achieves Success in Housing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Today's China Daily quoted Xu
Kuangdi, the mayor of Shanghai, as saying Shanghai's housing
system suits the needs of a market economy.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview that Shanghai, the largest city in
China with the population of 12 million, has achieved significant
success in housing reforms during the past several years by
setting up public housing funds, selling State-owned houses to to
current tenants and raising rents.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, an industrial coastal city in east China, started
housing reform in 1991 to improve living conditions for local
residents.
</P>
<P>
A housing survey in 1985 showed that nearly half of the city's
1.8 million households were overcrowded. The survey said 216,000
homes had less than four square metres per person, including
15,200 with less than two square metres per lead.
</P>
<P>
By 1992, housing reform helped Shanghai resettle all the
households living in less than 2.5 square metres of space per
capita.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, 20,000 families with less than 4 square metres per head
were relocated in 10.15 million square metres of new housing.
</P>
<P>
The city's per capita living space has risen from 6.6 square
metres in the early 1990s to 8 square metres in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Now 50.7 percent of housing has private toilets and
kitchens. The percentage is expected to reach 70 percent by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million people have moved into new houses over the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the city's public housing fund contained 7.72 billion
yuan (930 million US dollars) to help residents purchase their own
homes.
</P>
<P>
According to the official statistics, home-buyers accounted for
34.3 percent of the total residents in 1995, compared with 12.3
percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kuangdi said Shanghai would probe ways to commercialize
housing to replace the traditional practice that enterprises build
houses and distribute them free to workers.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that housing reform has improved the living
conditions of local residents and enabled more people to purchase
housing, noted Mayor Xu.

XIGAZE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A young Tibetan woman sits on a
bench as a middle-aged doctor, wearing both long white gown and
Kasaya (religious clothes for monks), gives her an injection.
</P>
<P>
The woman looks calm, but the doctor seems a little bit shy,
with his eyes looking at other places instead of at the syringe.
</P>
<P>
This typical scene happens every day in a hospital in Tibet's
Zhaxi Lhunbo temple.
</P>
<P>
Located in the second largest city of Tibet, Xigaze, the Zhaxi
Lhunbo temple was built in 1447, and was once the residence of
successive Panchen Lama. It is still the largest lamasery in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The hospital of the temple already has a history of 30 years,
and now there are nine doctors and nurses serving not only the
Lamas, but also patients from outside the temple.
</P>
<P>
Pubu, a 49 year-old lama doctor, said that treatment and
medicines are free except for a two to three Yuan (some 0.25 to
0.36 US dollars) registration fee.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our patients are from outside, at least 180 in one
day", he said.
</P>
<P>
Pubu, who started his career as a lama doctor in 1965, has
received basic training in both Western medicine and traditional
Tibetan medicine.

ISLAMABAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen people were killed and
many others injured when six masked gunmen opened fire on a
religious gathering held in a village in Punjab province of

According to the local press today, the gunmen riding a pick-up

The attackers, however, managed to take away their slain
accomplices' bodies when fleeing the scene.

Another 12 people were killed on August 14 during an

for more than ten minutes.

According to Pubu, the temple provides 30,000 Yuan (about 3,700
US dollars) a year to the hospital for medicines and equipment.
</P>
<P>
"Now our hospital is able to do fluoroscopy and infusions for
patients", he told with pride.
</P>
<P>
In order to save money, several times every year Pubu and his
colleagues will climb mountains to gather medicinal herbs and
prepare them for use.
</P>
<P>
"Actually throughout history traditional Tibetan medicine has
long been closely linked with temples and lamas, including the now
most authoritative Lhasa Hospital of Tibetan Medicine", he said.
</P>
<P>
While the 49-year old Pubu is the oldest lama doctor in the
hospital, whereas the 19-year old Luosang is the youngest. He was
sent to a Tibetan medicine school at the age of 12, and received 6
years of systematic training.
</P>
<P>
Although not having enough time to recite scriptures like other
lamas, young Luosang does not feel any pity, for, as he said, "to
treat the patient and release their suffering, and to save their
lives is by no means different from our religious ideal".
</P>
<P>
"I like my position here and I want to be a lama doctor for all
my life", he said.
</P>
<P>
Outside the window the fragrant scent of flowers growing in the
yard drifts into the building, together with people's laughters
and talk of cured patients. Inside the hospital, the lama doctors
are still quiet, serious, and doing their job with patience.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Restrict Key School Overcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal
authorities have taken steps to stop the inconsistent fees some
primary and middle schools charge in the name of "high teaching
quality".
</P>
<P>
The city will try to bridge the school-quality within two years
to turn the tide of pupils flooding towards key schools in pursuit
of better education.
</P>
<P>
All together 73 schools with relatively weak faculties on the
outskirts of the city are targeted for improvement.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has cracked down this year on schools with inconsistent
fee-charging practices. So far the authorities have investigated
106 schools on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last month, more than nine million yuan (1.1
million US dollars), the proceeds of random levying which exceeded
the standards set by the Beijing Municipal Education Commission,
had been returned to the families of over-charged students.
</P>
<P>
The investigations indicated that most schools in the capital
have abided by the standards.
</P>
<P>
In recent years more and more parents have tried to get their
children into the better schools. Because these schools can not
take all applicants, administrators sometimes raise fees to reduce
the number of applicants.
</P>
<P>
A survey reported that entrance fees ranging from 5,000 yuan
(602 US dollars) to 20,000 yuan (2,410 US dollars) are charged at
key schools.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the State Education Commission (SEC) and other
relevant departments again listed unauthorized fee collection by
some schools as a serious problem, said Wang Wenzhan,
director-general of the Basic Education Department under the SEC.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to eliminate this practice will focus on Beijing,
Shanghai, Tianjin and capital cities of various provinces where
inconsistent charging of fees is serious, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Crew Return Home After Afghan Escape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Seven Russian crew members who
succeeded in escaping from one-year captivity by the Afghan
opposition Taleban militia arrived in Moscow tonight.
</P>
<P>
The seven, who fled to Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab
Emirates, from Afghan city of Quandahar on Saturday, said they had
been planning for the escape for more than half a year.
</P>
<P>
They got their best chance after having persuaded the Taleban
to have a technical check on their cargo aircraft Ilyushin-76,
which had been forced to land in Quandahar by a Taleban jet
fighter while shipping ammunition to Afghan capital of Kabul from
Tirana, Albania, on August 3, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Three Taleban guards escorted the Russian airmen to go aboard
but were disarmed later. The Russian crew successfully started up
the engines and took off. They narrowly missed two Taleban
vehicles which rushed to block their way and flew out their plane
at treetop height to avoid radar detection. The three disarmed
Taleban guards were also taken to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Ignatenko had soon been to
the United Arab Emirates as the president's special envoy and
negotiated for the airmen's return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin,
whose government had earlier tried but failed to secure the
release of the airmen, congratulated them on their escape.
</P>
<P>
The crew members left Moscow shortly afterwards for Kazan, some
320 kilometers southeast of the capital, to be reunited with their
families.
</P>
<P>
They are scheduled to return to Moscow in a week for a major
reception in the Kremlin.

<HEADLINE> One Million People Require Relocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Three Gorges
Dam will require the relocation of approximately one million
people. How this enormous task will have immense influence on the
progress of the project, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's approach to the task is to provide
relocated residents with a large subsidy to help them resettle
elsewhere, said Wang Rushu, member of an environmental panel
affiliated with the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development
Corp (CTGPC).
</P>
<P>
People evacuated from the area because of the dam are promised
a compensation of 40,000 yuan (4,800 US dollars) each. The total
compensation -- 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion US dollars) -- equals
the budget of the dam project in terms of 1992 constant prices,
according to Qin Zhongyi, CTGPC vice-president.
</P>
<P>
That sacrifice, of money and the leaving of familiar homes,
will bring enormous rewards. Downstream, the lives and property of
15 million people will be protected against flood. Upstream, the
more efficient waterway will help cut shipping costs by an
estimated 35-37 percent, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The enormous power station to emerge at the dame will bring
China 84.7 billion kilowatt/hours of electric power annually -- an
amount that, if generated at fossil-fuel burning power stations,
would emit 100 million tons of carbon dioxide, 10,000 tons of
carbon monoxide, 2 million tons of sulfur dioxide and 370,000 tons
of nitrogen oxide -- major contributors to global warming and acid
rain, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The future reservoir -- stretching 660 kilometers upstream to
Chongqing and able to hold 22.15 billion cubic meters of water at
its maximum -- will play a part in China's South-North water
diversion plan to help increase water supply in China's northwest
interior, Want said.
</P>
<P>
He Gong, CTGPC vice-president, said he is confident that the
ecosystem along the future reservoir area will turn out to be as
good as, if not better than, what he saw during a recent tour of
major dam projects in the United States and South America.
</P>
<P>
He said the Export-Import Bank of the United States made its
May decision not to sign a letter of interest on financing US
exports to the Three Gorges project but is still seeking further
clarification on environmental concerns from the Chinese side
before finally making up its mind.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to help the bank change its mind, but even if
it doesn't, the Three Gorges project proceeds. US business
interests stand to suffer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers, contractors, consults and financiers from around
the world, including the United States, covet a chance to take
part in the Three Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, he said, China has been spending 400 million US
dollars a year overseas to buy construction equipment for the dam
project. About 50 percent of the orders have been placed with US
firms.

<HEADLINE> Closer Sino-Australian Trade Ties Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming visits by two
senior Australian government officials to China, the first of
their kind since the establishment of the new government of
Australia, are expected to help bring bilateral economic ties
closer, China Daily said today.
</P>
<P>
Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer is scheduled to
arrive this week, and Tim Fischer, Australian deputy prime
minister and minister for trade, will come next week, the
newspaper quoted sources with the Australian Embassy as saying.
</P>
<P>
"China will go on viewing Australia as an important part of its
market diversification strategy; and the new Australian government
recently expressed the desire to continue its Asia-oriented
strategy and strengthen its economic ties with China," said Wang
Chao, an official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
For four years in a row Sino-Australian trade volume has
broken records, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Customs statistics indicate that during the first half
of this year, imports and exports between the two countries
totalled 2.45 billion US dollars, up 33.8 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Investment also indicated good momentum, the newspaper said,
adding that during the first quarter of this year, China approved
97 Australian-backed projects, involving contracted Australian
capital of 174 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wang said there is good potential for Australian investors to
play an active part in the fields like agriculture,
telecommunications, transportation, energy and infrastructure
construction in China.
</P>
<P>
Australia, meanwhile, has grown into the largest target of
Chinese investment overseas. Chinese enterprises have launched 135
enterprises in Australia with accumulated Chinese-contracted
investments of 330 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Auto Market Expected to Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Competition in Beijing's
automobile market is set to intensify as indicated by auto
dealers' major expansion and promotion campaigns, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In spite of poor automobile sales and inventory over-stock
nationwide, auto dealers in the capital are diversifying their
services to consolidate their position in the market.
</P>
<P>
Dealers are renovating existing facilities and expanding
business for larger market shares.
</P>
<P>
Despite many factors that restrict demand and dampen potential
customers' desire for cars, demand in Beijing has been on the
rise. Beijing earlier this years resumed control of institutional
purchases of cars and buses.
</P>
<P>
Control had been suspended for approximately two years amidst
calls for a better market to foster the fledgling motor
industry. Now work units must have a licence before buying a car
or bus.
</P>
<P>
However, as car buying by individuals has increased faster than
that of work units, sales have not been much affected. In the
first six months of this year, 70,000 cars, buses and trucks were
sold in Beijing, increasing the capital's automotive population to
1.05 million units.
</P>
<P>
At the Beijing Asian Games Village Automobile Exchange, the
capital's largest of its kind, a bonded zone for imported
automobiles is ready to accommodate foreign auto markers' products.
</P>
<P>
The zone, located in a business hall for imports and covering
1,500 square meters adjacent to the existing hall, will be
supervised by Beijing Customs, which has just opened an office
there.
</P>
<P>
The exchange, now having a floor space of 60,000 sq m for
business and accommodating 1,000 cars for exhibition and sale,
will be integrated into an automotive market information computer
network to be established by the State Planning Commission, said
the exchange's managing director Su Hui.
</P>
<P>
Financed by the Beijing authorities, the exchange will increase
its business space to 150,000 sq m next year by adding a
60,000-sq-m department store to accommodate 300,000 types of
automobile appliances including examination instruments, lubricant
oils, maintenance tools, anti-theft devices and audio and video
systems.
</P>
<P>
Its expansion programme also includes a 30,000-sq-m service
center to examine new cars as well as modify and repair cars in
use.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the exchange, which was established late
last year, may exceed 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars)
when all the facilities are in place, Su said. "For long-term
success, it's worth plunging money into the programme."
</P>
<P>
Now 72 trading companies have rented space in the exchange.

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Comes to Thailand via Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazil has become the main
transit point for smuggling cocaine into Thailand, according to
Thai Narcotics Control Board's chief Prija Champaratna.
</P>
<P>
The increasing popularity of cocaine among the affluent members
of the society has become a source of major concern and the Thai
government will have to set up its efforts to prevent the drug
from entering Thailand, Prija was quoted today by local newspaper
Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will seek cooperation from other countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the drug traffickers, he said, were African nationals.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 200 African drug traffickers in Thai
prisons and they have become costly burden. Thailand cannot deport
them because it has no extradition agreement with these countries.
</P>
<P>
Prija, who returned from South Africa last week, said the Thai
Narcotics Control Board has reached an agreement with the
anti-narcotics officials in that country to cooperation in drug
suppression.

BANGKOK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai jewelers will visit
Tanzania soon in the hope of finding a regular supplier of
gemstones, according to the Thai Gem and Jewelry Trades'
Association.
</P>
<P>
The association wants a central company to gather Tanzania
gemstones for allocation to its members, an arrangement similar to
that used to buy stones from Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
Talks would be held with the Tanzania government because it
preferred to export cut and polished stones which earned more than
sales of rough goods, an association source was quoted today by
local newspaper Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
More Tanzania sapphires and rubies were being used in Thailand
because of their quality, the source said, adding Tanzania wanted
Thais to establish cutting plants locally but it lacked
gem-cutters.

<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Andrea Ferrigato beat
defending champion Max Sciandri of Britain at the finish to win
Sunday's Leeds Classic, the seventh cycling event on the World Cup
circuit.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old finished the 235-kilometer leg in 5 hours 43
minutes 13 seconds, beating Sciandri by one second.
</P>
<P>
Sciandri, a disappointed bronze medalist in the Olympic road
race, was so upset about not winning at Leeds that he declined to
appear on the podium afterwards.
</P>
<P>
He was fined 9,500 Swiss francs (dlrs 7,900) for the action and
was also docked 2,500 Swiss Francs (dlrs 2,080) from his prize
money
</P>
<P>
``It's killing me that I lost,'' Sciandri said. ``I didn't have
a good day because I had a stomach problem, but that's no
excuse. When somebody is stronger, than what can you do? I'm
extremely disappointed. To have won here twice would have been
great.''
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Johan Museeuw, the series overall point leader,
finished third. He has 137 points to 88 for Stefano Zanini of
Italy and 73 for Italian Michele Bartoli. Zanini missed the race
with an injury.
</P>
<P>
The win moved Ferrigato into sixth place in the overall
standing with 62 points. Four more events remain in this year's
World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Leaders Hold Talks With IFOR Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb acting President
Biljana Plavsic and parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik held
talks with peace Implementation Force (IFOR) ground force
commander Lt.-Gen. Michael Walker today to defuse tension between
the Serbs and the IFOR.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held in the Serb administrative center, were
organized after the IFOR threatens to destroy a Serb munitions
dump in the village of Margetici near the eastern town of Sokolac,
allegedly for containing quantities of banned arms and ammunition,
the Tanjug news agency reported from Pale.
</P>
<P>
After the threat, the IFOR blocked the village with tanks and
armed vehicles Saturday, thus arousing tension between the Serb
army and the NATO-led IFOR.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Serb army general staff released a
statement warning that the IFOR's intention was a very dangerous
provocation that could lead to unnecessary incidents and
jeopardize the further implementation of the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
The dump was legally registered in agreement with the military
part of the Dayton accords on March 19, 1996, and contains only
defensive arms, whose quantities are not limited under the accords
and which do not pose any threat to the IFOR forces or other sides
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Nine May Be Killed in Crash of Clinton's Support Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- There was no sign of
survivors for the nine people aboard the crashed military plane
carrying gear for U.S. President Bill Clinton, according to a
spokeswoman for the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
The D-130 U.S. Air Force plane crashed late Saturday night in
Jackson, Wyoming, soon after it took off from the Jackson Hole
Airport. Eight people, including a Secret Service man, were on
board the plane when it crashed about 20 kilometers southeast of
the airport about 50 kilometers south of Yellowstone National
Park.
</P>
<P>
The four-engine plane, which was used to shuttle presidential
vehicles, was headed to New York City for Clinton's birthday
celebration, according to a White House spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, finishing a nine-day vacation in Wyoming, left Jackson
five hours before the crash and returned to Washington by
helicopter early today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he and his wife were "very sad and shocked" by the
crash. "This is especially painful to us because (the victims)
worked for me and did an invaluable service and I am very sad
about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
A Clinton administration official said the pilot reported
mechanical trouble and had started to return to the airport.
Officials said the Air Force would conduct the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Recovery teams had to hike and ride on horseback today to reach
the wreckage of the plane. There are no roads or trails to the
scene and it took recovery crews more than three hours to reach
the site this morning.
</P>
<P>
The only pieces of the plane left intact were a piece of the
tail section and several wheels, said Keith Benefiel of the Teton
County Search and Rescue Team.

<HEADLINE> US Prison Population Rises in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. prison population
increased by 6.8 percent to nearly 1.6 million inmates in 1995,
leaving many federal and state prisons overcrowded, the U.S.
Justice Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 figure, including 1 million state prisoners, 500,000
inmates in local jails and 100,000 federal prisoners, also doubled
the number a decade ago, the Justice Department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
The figure shows that by the end of 1995, one out of 167
Americans was in prison or jail, compared to one out of every 320
a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the sharp rise in inmates has forced prison
officials to find 1,618 more beds each week.
</P>
<P>
"In 1995, state prison systems reported operating between 14
percent and 25 percent above capacity. The Federal Bureau of
Prisons reported operating 26 percent over capacity," the bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
There were a number of factors to the rise of inmates. A
notable sign was that the rate of juvenile violent crime rose
steadily from 1987 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that 7,888 youths under 18 were held in local
jails last year, a 17 percent increase over the year earlier. More
than three-quarters of these juveniles had been tried or were
awaiting trial as adults.
</P>
<P>
Besides, many states and the federal government have increased
sentences for violent crimes and approved mandatory life terms for
anyone convicted of three major crimes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Chinese
National People's Congress, headed by Standing Committee
Vice-Chairman Wu Jieping, left Yugoslavia this afternoon after a
five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
This was the first official visit by a Chinese parliamentary
delegation to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since the
suspension of the U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
The delegation had talks with Yugoslav officials, during which
the two sides agreed that the two countries, peoples and
parliaments are traditionally close friends and should promote and
develop all-round cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During its stay, the Chinese delegation held separate talks
with Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic and Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic, the speakers of both houses of the Yugoslav parliament, a
Yugoslav parliamentary delegation and the speaker of the Serbian
parliament.
