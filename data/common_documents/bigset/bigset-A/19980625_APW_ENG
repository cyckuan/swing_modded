Optus signs management deal with Compaq company 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Optus Communications Pty. Ltd. of
Australia has signed a U.S. dlrs 150 million (Australia dollars 250
million) outsourcing contract with a unit of U.S.-based Compaq
Computer, Optus said Thursday.
	   Under the contract, information technology concern Digital
Equipment Corp. will manage Optus' two data centers, network
systems infrastructure, help desk, desktop and production support.
	   ``Digital will be responsible for the efficient management and
future upgrades of the administration applications run from the
data centers, as well as Optus' internal network systems
infrastructure and services,'' the company said in a statement.
	   Digital was chosen because it offered ``a unified management
structure, significant cost-savings and improved service levels,''
said Optus chief technical officer Bill Hope.
	   The contract is part of Optus reviewing all aspects of
information technology to align itself with the world's best
practice operation, the company said.
	   To meet Optus' service delivery needs, Digital will establish an
operations management center over the next six months, Optus said.
	   U.K.-based Cable and Wireless Communications PLC owns 49 percent
of Optus, while Australian health care and transport concern Mayne
Nickless holds 25 percent.
	   Analysts believe the shareholders in Optus are working toward an
initial public offering of shares, expected towards the end of
1998.

Nigerian Olowokandi chosen No. 1 by Clippers AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with draft over; additional trades; EDITS to conform
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Michael Olowokandi, a
7-foot-1 (2.16-meter) Nigerian who grew up in England and has been
playing competitive basketball for only three years, was selected
first in the NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers.
	   The Clippers decided to pick Olowokandi in Wednesday night's
draft instead of Arizona point guard Mike Bibby, the player they
had been expected to take until having a change of heart over the
last couple of days.
	   Olowokandi, who barely knew how to play the game when he arrived
at Pacific University, averaged 22.2 points and 11.2 rebounds last
season.
	   ``Seeing my name in the No. 1 spot is unbelievable, especially
when you consider where I came from three years ago _ not having
played basketball _ and then to this, not the No. 3 pick but the
No. 1 pick,'' Olowokandi said. ``That's something that'll take me a
week or so, or a little bit longer, to get over.''
	   Four trades were made during the draft:
	   _ The Toronto Raptors, after picking Antawn Jamison of North
Carolina fourth overall, sent him to Golden State for his college
teammate, Vince Carter, who was selected fifth.
	   _ The Phoenix Suns sent guard Steve Nash to the Dallas Mavericks
in a three-way trade also involving Milwaukee. The Bucks got the
sixth pick, Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor, from the Mavericks in
exchange for the ninth pick, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, and the 19th
pick, Pat Garrity of Notre Dame. Garrity was then sent to the Suns
along with Bubba Wells, Martin Muursepp and Dallas' 1999
first-round pick for Nash, whose parents came to the draft to
represent the Suns.
	   _ The Vancouver Grizzlies, after selecting Bibby, dealt guard
Antonio Daniels to San Antonio for Carl Herrera and the rights to
the 24th pick, Felipe Lopez.
	   _ The Utah Jazz sent the 29th pick, Nazr Mohammed of Kentucky,
to Philadelphia for future considerations.
	   The Raptors also were talking with the New York Knicks about a
Marcus Camby-Charles Oakley trade, according to sources who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The Grizzlies, the hosts of the draft, selected Bibby second to
roars of approval from a crowd of about 8,000. Bibby, who left
Arizona after his sophomore season, has drawn comparisons to Jason
Kidd for his playmaking skills. Many expected him to be drafted
first overall.
	   ``Me being No. 1 was just a lot of talk and rumor, so I didn't
expect anything,'' said Bibby, whose father, Henry, played several
years in the NBA and now coaches Southern Cal.
	   The Denver Nuggets, coming off a season in which they won only
11 games, picked Kansas forward Raef LaFrentz with the third pick.
	   It was the first surprise of the night, since Paul Pierce,
considered by many to be the best all-around player in the draft,
had been expected to be among the top three picks. He ended up
dropping all the way to the Boston Celtics at No. 10.
	   LaFrentz, a 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) forward, was a first-team
All-American after averaging 19.8 points and 11.1 rebounds for the
Jayhawks.
	   Traylor, who dropped 40 pounds (18 kilograms) after the season
ended, tipped the scales at about 320 pounds (144 kilograms) while
averaging 16.2 points and 10.0 rebounds for Michigan. By acquiring
him, the Bucks extended their streak of trading their first-round
pick to four straight years.
	   The agent for the 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) Nowitzki, who is
currently in the German army, told teams that his client may choose
to play professionally in Europe for the next season or two. Dallas
coach Don Nelson said he and his son, Donnie, who once coached the
20-year-old, will be leaving soon for Germany to convince Nowitzki
to play for the Mavericks.
	   The Sacramento Kings came up with another surprise by choosing
Florida guard Jason Williams with the seventh pick. Williams was
kicked off the team by Florida coach Billy Donovan, reportedly
after testing positive for marijuana. At the time, Williams was
leading the Southeastern Conference in steals, assists and free
throw percentage.
	   The 76ers took 19-year-old Larry Hughes of Saint Louis with the
eighth pick. The youngest player to be picked up to that point,
Hughes averaged 20.9 points for the Billikens and was considered by
many to be the player in the draft with the greatest potential.
	   Pierce was finally picked 10th by the Boston Celtics, who had to
be ecstatic that such a talented player had dropped so far.
	   ``It's a little disappointing,'' said Pierce, who left Kansas
after a junior season in which he averaged 20.4 points. ``That's
the way things go. I have to move on and use it for motivation.
Boston is a great situation for me.''
	   Bonzi Wells of Ball State went to the Pistons with the 11th
pick. Wells averaged 25.4, 22.0 and 22.8 points over his final
three seasons and broke Ron Harper's Mid-American conference
scoring record.
	   The Orlando Magic, who had been trying to move one of their
three first-round picks, took Michael Doleac of Utah with the 12th
pick to fill a gaping hole at center caused by last season's trade
of Rony Seikaly to New Jersey.
	   With the 13th pick, the Magic selected another center, Keon
Clark of UNLV.
	   The Houston Rockets, who also had three first-round picks, took
small forward Michael Dickerson of Arizona at No. 14 before Orlando
made its third selection, forward Matt Harpring of Georgia Tech.
	   The Rockets also took shooting guard Bryce Drew of Valparaiso
with the 16th pick and Turkish center Mirsad Turkcan with the 18th
pick.
	   Al Harrington of St. Patrick's in Elizabeth, New Jersey, was the
only high-schooler picked in the first round, going 25th to
Indiana, and the three-time defending champion Chicago Bulls chose
Oregon State guard Corey Benjamin.
	   Two Slovenian players were taken in the first round. Radoslav
Nesterovic, a 7-footer (2.13-meter) who helped lead Kinder Bologna
to the EuroLeague championship in April, went to Minnesota at No.
17, and Vladimir Stepania, a 6-11 1/2 (2.12-meter) center, went to
Seattle at No. 27.

Share prices of ailing Japanese bank plunge Bank Corp. in grafs 6-7 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with report LTCB considering possible deal with Swiss
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Share prices of the Long-Term Credit Bank plunged
to 50 yen in early trading Thursday, adding to fears that the
institution may be foundering.
	   Share prices dropped to that level from Wednesday's close of 70
yen within the first hour of trading. LTCB closed the morning
session at 57 yen per share.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, has become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   Bank officials have repeatedly denied rumors that the bank is on
the verge of failure, but they recently acknowledged it holds some
1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans.
	   At the bank's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, bank
officials detailed plans to shut down about half of its overseas
outlets and cut staff by 20 percent. That plan had been formulated
in February, before its current crisis began.
	   LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi was quoted as saying by Kyodo
News agency that the bank was considering a merger to save it from
collapse, including a possible deal with Swiss Bank Corp. or
another unidentified bank.
	   Bank spokesmen refused to immediately comment on the report.
	   Japan's government said Wednesday it is racing to set up an
emergency bank to provide loans to cash-strapped companies left out
in the cold by private banks struggling with bad loans.
	   Details remain vague, but the new bank likely would fill a
breech left by bad loan-burdened private banks that could go out of
business.
	   Investors are concerned, however, that the government may be
willing to let some weak institutions go under in order to
strengthen the overall financial system.
	   That concern began to focus on LTCB last week, after Moody's
Investors Services lowered its credit rating for the bank and sent
its share prices plunging.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank is one of three credit banks established
at the end of World War II to provide long-term business loans in
an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   But as deregulation has made it easier for companies to raise
money directly by issuing stocks or selling bonds, the banks' role
has been largely lost.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank has 3,600 employees and 28 trillion (dlrs
203 billion) in assets.

McGwire hits 34th homer, but Cardinals lose to Indians 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Mark McGwire's 34th homer wasn't enough to
overcome Cleveland's seven-run first inning as the Indians played
their own version of muscle-ball in a 14-3 rout of St. Louis on
Wednesday night.
	   McGwire ended a drought of 18 at-bats without a homer with a
solo shot in the fourth off Jaret Wright.
	   But the Indians stole all the drama from the Cardinals' first
visit to Jacobs Field with seven runs in the first off Mark
Petkovsek (5-4). Manny Ramirez hit his seventh career grand slam,
and Travis Fryman added to the onslaught with a three-run shot.
	   Wright (7-4) allowed three runs and nine hits in 6 1-3 innings,
improving to 6-1 in his last seven starts.
 &UR; Tigers 7, Cubs 6, 11 innings &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Chicago's Sammy Sosa tied the major league record
for home runs in a month, but the Tigers rallied for a 7-6 victory
on Gabe Alvarez's RBI single in the 11th inning.
	   The Cubs were one out away from snapping a three-game losing
streak when Bobby Higginson hit a game-tying, two-run homer off Rod
Beck in the ninth. The Cubs went on to lose their fourth straight
and 11th in 15 games.
	   Sosa hit his 31st homer of the season and 18th in June in the
first inning to match the one-month mark set by Detroit's Rudy York
in August 1937, and break the NL record of 17 set by San
Francisco's Willie Mays in August 1965.
	   Doug Brocail (3-0) struck out four in two innings for the win.
Marc Pisciotta (0-2) took the loss.
 &UR; Yankees 10, Braves 6 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, David Cone allowed five hits in seven innings and
Joe Girardi had three hits and two RBIs as New York gained the
upper hand in the Summer Classic.
	   The Yankees have won two of three interleague games between the
teams that entered the day with baseball's best records.
	   Cone (10-2) had the first regular-season RBI by a Yankees
pitcher in more than 25 years. Atlanta's Kevin Millwood (9-4) was
routed in his second straight attempt for win No. 10, and three
errors by a sloppy Atlanta defense led to four unearned runs.
	   Mariano Rivera got his 18th save.
 &UR; Mets 6, Orioles 3 &QC; 
	   In New York, Rick Reed pitched seven solid innings and Mike
Piazza had three hits and a home run for New York.
	   Reed (9-4) got his eighth win in 10 starts with some help from
the Orioles, who were playing their first game in Shea Stadium
against the Mets since losing Game 5 of the 1969 World Series.
	   The Mets broke a 1-1 tie by scoring four runs in the fifth,
helped by three wild pitches and a throwing error by Pete Smith
(0-2).
	   Reed allowed nine hits and also contributed at the plate with a
single and two sacrifices. John Franco got his 18th save.
 &UR; Phillies 11, Red Sox 8 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, Mike Lieberthal had three RBIs as Philadelphia
tied its season high for runs in winning its fourth straight game.
	   Rookie Carlton Loewer (2-0) gave up eight hits and seven runs in
six-plus innings in his third major league start. Mark Leiter got
his 15th save.
	   Lieberthal went 1-for-3 with three RBIs. Gregg Jefferies had two
RBIs and scored three runs. Kevin Jordan and Mark Lewis also had
two RBIs apiece as Philadelphia chased Red Sox starter Steve Avery
(4-2) with a seven-run, six-hit third.
 &UR; Blue Jays 7, Expos 6 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, Roger Clemens picked up his first win in five
interleague starts as Toronto won its fourth straight.
	   Ed Sprague hit a two-run homer to cap a five-run first against
Shawn Boskie (1-1) and Carlos Delgado led off the third with his
12th homer as Toronto jumped out to a 6-0 lead. Former Expos
catcher Darrin Fletcher went 3-for-4 with two RBIs.
	   Clemens (8-6) allowed five runs on 12 hits in seven-plus innings
as he won his third straight decision. Randy Myers pitched the
ninth for his 21st save.
 &UR; White Sox 4, Reds 2 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Frank Thomas and Magglio Ordonez each homered as
Chicago handed Cincinnati its 11th consecutive loss.
	   Thomas hit a two-run homer in the first inning off Scott
Winchester (3-5), his 13th, and Ordonez hit a solo homer with two
out in the fourth. Ray Durham matched his career high with four
hits as the White Sox won their third straight for the first time
this season.
	   Jaime Navarro (6-9) snapped a three-game losing streak with the
win, giving up two runs on five hits and three walks over 6 2-3
innings. Bill Simas got the last six outs for his third save.
 &UR; Marlins 8, Devil Rays 4 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Derrek Lee hit a three-run homer and drove in four
runs as Florida beat former teammate Tony Saunders and Tampa Bay.
	   Todd Zeile added a two-run shot and finished with three hits as
the Marlins won for the fifth time in seven games. Brian Meadows
(6-6) went five innings for the victory, giving up one run and six
hits.
	   Florida scored three runs in the first inning and added two in
the third against Saunders (1-8), taken from the Marlins as the
first pick of the expansion draft. Paul Sorrento homered for Tampa
Bay.
 &UR; Pirates 10, Royals 3 &QC; 
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Kevin Young had three of Pittsburgh's
season-high 19 hits and Mark Smith and Jose Guillen homered in the
Pirates first game at Kansas City.
	   Smith connected off Glendon Rusch (5-9) for a three-run shot in
the third inning and Guillen had a two-run homer in the eighth.
Young, released by the Royals following the 1996 season, had a
double, two singles and two RBIs.
	   Chris Peters (3-5) went five innings for the victory, giving up
nine hits and three runs.
 &UR; Brewers 3, Twins 1 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, Jeromy Burnitz hit his 17th home run and
Milwaukee starter Steve Woodard held Minnesota to one run in 5 1-3
innings.
	   Burnitz opened the scoring in the fourth inning with a solo
homer to center field, and added an RBI double in a two-run sixth
inning.
	   Woodard (5-5) gave up seven hits, allowing the only run on Matt
Lawton's sixth-inning homer. Bob Wickman pitched 1 2-3 innings for
his ninth save.
	   LaTroy Hawkins (4-7) took the loss.

Soldiers push back protesters in Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers pushed backed more than 100
protesters who rallied outside a government office Thursday to urge
Indonesia's military to withdraw from Irian Jaya on the western
half of New Guinea island.
	   The demonstration, in front of the office of a Defense
Department policy think tank, was noisy but peaceful.
	   Irian Jaya, about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) east of
Jakarta, was taken over by Indonesia in 1963. Most of its 1.5
million people are Melanesian and many still follow traditional
village lifestyles. Many are Christian in predominately Muslim
Indonesian.
	   Tens of thousands of settlers, known as transmigrants, from
other crowded parts of Indonesia have moved to the largely
underdeveloped province, triggering discontent.
	   A small rebel group named the Free West Papua Movement has been
fighting a guerrilla war there since the 1960s. The military said
that a rebel group ambushed and killed three settlers last week.
	   Thursday's protesters claimed that the Indonesian military has
been using unnecessary force in the province.
	   ``We are part of this country. So why are there so many
Indonesian troops in our hometowns?'' said a protest organizer, who
identified himself by the single name of Rambe.
	   ``Stop the genocide,'' read one banner held by demonstrators.
	   Meanwhile, several dozen protesters calling for the release of
political prisoners staged another peaceful rally outside the
private home of President B.J. Habibie, who replaced autocrat
President Suharto in May.
	   Since taking office, Habibie has released several dozen
dissidents jailed during Suharto's time in office. He has promised
to free more over time as part of a plan for political reform, to
include elections next year.
	   Human rights groups complain that about 200 still remain behind
bars.
	   Among those at Thursday's rally was former legislator Sri
Bintang Pamungkas, who was freed by Habibie last month after being
sent to prison for insulting Suharto.
	   Protests against the government, rare under Suharto's strict
rule, have now become a daily event in Jakarta.

Ghost rumor haunts Myanmar capital 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has
practice keeping the political opposition in check, but its
security forces recently have been forced to confront a more
elusive target _ rumors of a ghost.
	   Rumors have spread in the capital since last Friday that a ghost
has been terrorizing an apartment near a busy road junction,
reportedly smashing glasses, cups and light bulbs.
	   Every day, hundreds of curious observers have been assembling in
front of the so-called haunted house at Myeinigone ward in
Sanchaung township, about 4 kilometers (2 1/2 miles) from downtown
Yangon. On Saturday, about 1,000 people gathered there.
	   The area is also swarming with security officials, in numbers
which are usually reserved for keeping a close eye on the country's
pro-democracy activists, whose activities are tightly controlled.
	   In a coincidence that has fueled rumors about the apparition,
the intersection near the house was the scene of violence 10 years
ago this month during massive anti-government protests.
	   Student demonstrations in June 1988 were brutally crushed by the
riot police, with a curfew declared and schools and universities
shut down.
	   The crowds outside the house say only that they hope to get a
glimpse of the ``poltergeist'' _ a stone-throwing ghost _ which has
reportedly been wrecking the belongings inside. The apartment's
owner recently moved to another home downtown.
	   Many of the spectators believe in the existence of ghosts, some
are just curious, a few skeptical, yet people from as far away as
Hlaingtharyar _ a poor neighborhood 15 kilometers (9 miles)
northwest of Yangon _ have come to see the ``haunted apartment,''
travelling by car, bus, rickshaw, bicycle and on foot.
	   ``I will not go away until I see the ghost,'' a 50-year old
woman said Sunday to a policeman who told her to move along. ``I
came all the way from Hlaingtharyar just to see the ghost.''

Vietnam searching for solutions to problems 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam is searching for answers to its
financial problems as most economic indicators fall short of
government targets, the Investment newspaper reported Thursday.
	   It quoted Ministry of Planning and Investment officials as
listing six solutions that include improving industrial production,
dealing with bad loans and practicing thrift.
	   In the past year, the country has suffered from Typhoon Linda,
the worst drought in a century and the fallout from the Asian
financial crisis, all while trying to improve efficiency and
competitiveness, cut red tape and reform the banking system.
	   The government has been walking a tightrope by devaluing its
currency much less that its regional competitors, fearing the
increased costs of paying back dollar-denominated debt and
financing much-needed imports.
	   The result has been declines in imports and industrial
production that are leading to layoffs.
	   The General Statistical Office says gross domestic product is
estimated to grow at 6.6 percent, far lower than 8.8 percent last
year and the target of 9 percent.
	   Prime Minister Phan Van Khai has urged provincial leaders to
give special attention to agricultural production as they examine
their weaknesses and plan actions, the Nhan Dan newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   ``In any circumstances, a stable and developed agriculture will
ensure national stability and development,'' he said Wednesday
during a two-day conference with leaders of 31 northern provinces.
	   Nhan Dan said participants were optimistic with the achievements
so far, despite the lower economic indicators. A similar meeting
will be held with southern provincial leaders Friday and Saturday.
	   Industrial production is forecast to expand by 12.6 percent, 1
percent lower than the same period last year, while agriculture
production _ hit hard by the worst drought in a century _ is
growing by only 2 percent, compared with 4.9 percent last year.
	   Vietnam's export volume in the first half stood at dlrs 4.763
billion, up only 10.6 percent, compared with more than 20 percent
expansion last year and the target of 25 percent.
	   The trade deficit, which has emerged as the government principal
macroeconomic challenge this year, is growing.
	   Foreign direct investment also has declined by almost 50 percent
in the last year, and newly pledged investments were down by 15
percent in first six months of 1998.

	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Paul Pierce nearly ran out of
oxygen during the NBA draft.
	   ``You're sitting in there and holding your breath every time a
name is called and just waiting to get it over with. And then when
they call your name, you can finally breath,'' said Pierce.
	   Pierce, touted to go among the top three players in Wednesday's
NBA draft, was finally selected 10th by the Boston Celtics.
	   ``Yeah, I was holding it there for quite a while,'' Pierce joked
about his breath. ``I was about to pass out.''
	   The Kansas star said he will use the frustrations of the draft
to motivate him to prove the nine teams that passed him to be
wrong.
	   ``I just want to go out there next year to let them know that
they should have picked me,'' Pierce said. ``But I am happy that
(Celtics coach Rick) Pitino felt confident in my ability and gave
me a chance.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR: The 24 internationally-born eligible
prospects were the most in NBA draft history. Last year, 12 players
born outside the United States were among the 57 players drafted,
including No. 1 pick Tim Duncan, a native of the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
	   The number of international players drafted has quadrupled since
three were chosen in 1994.
	   This year, the first international player drafted was the No. 1
pick, Nigerian-born center Michael Olowokandi
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GRIZZLIES MAKE A POINT: The Vancouver Grizzlies appeared to be
cornering the market on point guards until announcing a trade of
Antonio Daniels, the No. 4 pick in last year's draft, to the San
Antonio Spurs.
	   The Grizzlies used the No. 2 overall pick on Wednesday to select
Arizona's Mike Bibby, temporarily adding a fourth point guard to
the team. The Grizzlies also have veterans Lee Mayberry and Bobby
Hurley.
	   On Tuesday, Grizzlies president and general manager Stu Jackson
said he would select Bibby if available because none of his other
point guards had proven they could be starters.
	   Daniels, who was benched toward the end of the season, was
traded for Felipe Lopez, the 24th pick in the draft, and Carl
Herrera.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SURPRISE TO EVERYONE: Top pick Michael Olowokandi said he
discovered from his agent Wednesday morning that he was going to be
selected by the Los Angeles Clippers.
	   Olowokandi didn't believe it then, nor did he believe it when
Arizona's Mike Bibby told him prior to the draft that the
Nigerian-born center was going to be taken first overall.
	   ``Here we are,'' Olowokandi said, standing before a group of
reporters, ``and I still can't believe it.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; FAMILY MATTERS: Virginia Bibby, mother of Mike Bibby, who was
selected second overall by the Vancouver Grizzlies, found solace in
the fact that her son was not taken with the first pick by the Los
Angeles Clippers.
	   Reminded that Mike's father, former NBA player Henry Bibby and
coach at the University of Southern California, works in the Los
Angeles area, Virginia Bibby said: ``I left it in the Lord's hands
and I would not be bothered and he wouldn't have been bothered. But
you're right, we don't have to deal with it, and he doesn't have to
deal with it.''
	   Mike Bibby hasn't spoken to his estranged father for years and
refuses to speak about him publicly.

Nigerian Olowokandi chosen No. 1 by Clippers AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Lakers-Nuggets trade
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Michael Olowokandi, a
7-foot-1 (2.16-meter) Nigerian who grew up in England and has been
playing competitive basketball for only three years, was selected
first in the NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers.
	   The Clippers decided to pick Olowokandi in Wednesday night's
draft instead of Arizona point guard Mike Bibby, the player they
had been expected to take until having a change of heart over the
last couple of days.
	   Olowokandi, who barely knew how to play the game when he arrived
at Pacific University, averaged 22.2 points and 11.2 rebounds last
season.
	   ``Seeing my name in the No. 1 spot is unbelievable, especially
when you consider where I came from three years ago _ not having
played basketball _ and then to this, not the No. 3 pick but the
No. 1 pick,'' Olowokandi said. ``That's something that'll take me a
week or so, or a little bit longer, to get over.''
	   Five trades were made during the draft:
	   _ The Toronto Raptors, after picking Antawn Jamison of North
Carolina fourth overall, sent him to Golden State for his college
teammate, Vince Carter, who was selected fifth.
	   _ The Phoenix Suns sent guard Steve Nash to the Dallas Mavericks
in a three-way trade also involving Milwaukee. The Bucks got the
sixth pick, Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor, from the Mavericks in
exchange for the ninth pick, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, and the 19th
pick, Pat Garrity of Notre Dame. Garrity was then sent to the Suns
along with Bubba Wells, Martin Muursepp and Dallas' 1999
first-round pick for Nash, whose parents came to the draft to
represent the Suns.
	   _ The Vancouver Grizzlies, after selecting Bibby, dealt guard
Antonio Daniels to San Antonio for Carl Herrera and the rights to
the 24th pick, Felipe Lopez.
	   _ The Utah Jazz sent the 29th pick, Nazr Mohammed of Kentucky,
to Philadelphia for future considerations.
	   _ The Los Angeles Lakers sent guard Nick Van Exel to Denver in
exchange for Tyronn Lue, the second of the Nuggets' two first-round
picks, and Tony Battie.

Independent gives Labor government, denies One Nation a role 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Labor Party will form
a minority government in Queensland state following the
announcement Thursday by an independent legislator that he will
give the party his crucial support.
	   Almost three weeks after Queensland voters went to the polls,
the knife-edge result was decided when independent Peter Wellington
said he will support Labor, which was one seat short of a majority
in the 89-seat state parliament after the June 13 poll.
	   The outcome denies the right-wing nationalist One Nation party
any role in government.
	   One Nation has sent shockwaves through Australian politics by
capturing 23 percent of the vote at its first electoral test,
severely eroding support for the conservative coalition which held
power in the state and which Prime Minister John Howard heads
nationally.
	   The state coalition had been trying to maintain power by
securing the support in parliament of the 11 One Nation
legislators, Wellington and one other independent, Liz Cunningham.
	   All Labor required was the vote of one of the independents. With
Wellington's vote, Labor will have a one vote majority and is now
able to form a government.
	   ``I am of the view that the Labor party is best able to provide
stable government for the next three years,'' he said.
	   Labor leader and premier-elect Peter Beattie, who previously
ruled out governing with One Nation support, held meetings with
both independents Wednesday.
	   Outgoing premier Rob Borbidge said he would officially resign
his commission following Wellington's announcement.

Guerrillas claim fatal attack on Israeli troops 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas claimed they bombed an
Israeli patrol in southern Lebanon Thursday, killing two and
wounding four Israeli soldiers.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the claim by Israel or
Lebanese security forces.
	   The attack came as preparations were underway for the exchange
of the remains of an Israeli soldier killed in South Lebanon last
year for the bodies of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas and
Lebanese prisoners held by Israel.
	   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said its fighters
detonated a large bomb early Thursday near an Israeli patrol near
Houla, 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the Israeli border and about 50
kilometers (31 miles) southeast of Sidon, provincial capital of
South Lebanon.
	   The statement said several members of the Israeli elite ``Egoz''
squad were either killed or wounded in the attack. But Hezbollah
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, later said two
soldiers were killed and four were wounded. They gave no details.
	   The statement said Hezbollah fighters detonated another bomb and
raked the area with ``appropriate weapons'' as extra Israeli units
arrived at the scene to assist the dead and wounded.
	   Israeli helicopters and several ambulances were seen rushing to
the targeted area to evacuate the casualties, the statement added.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to evict Israeli soldiers who
occupy a swath of southern Lebanon to protect Israel's northern
towns from cross-border attacks.

Asian Development Bank approves dlrs 1.5 billion loan to Indonesia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank's board
approved Thursday a dlrs 1.5 billion loan to be used to strengthen
and reform Indonesia's financial sector.
	   Political turmoil in Indonesia caused the loan to be delayed
over the past month, but the International Monetary Fund's recent
agreement to release the next portion of its rescue package for
Indonesia in early July put the ADB loan back on track.
	   The loan will be dispersed in three portions, an ADB official
said.
	   The ADB expects to pay dlrs 550 million shortly after the loan's
approval, although no specific timetable was disclosed. This will
be followed by another dlrs 500 million at the end of the year,
with the balance to be dispersed in 1999.

Three executed for killing U.S. engineer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Three men convicted of killing an American
engineer have been executed in southern China, according to a
report seen Thursday in Beijing.
	   Shi Zhaodong, Shi Shanfu, and Liu Huansen _ whose ages range
from 25 to 32 _ were executed after the Guangdong province Higher
Court rejected appeals of their convictions in the March 23 killing
of 42-year old Leonard Phillips of Athens, Tennessee, the Yangcheng
Evening News reported Wednesday.
	   Phillips, an engineer working at a Duracell battery
manufacturing plant in southern China, was stabbed repeatedly in
his hotel room in Dongguan _ a freewheeling, fast-growing city 100
kilometers (60 miles) northwest of Hong Kong.
	   Phillips, who worked for Chattanooga's TAD Technology Services,
was contracted by Duracell to install machinery and train workers
at the Duracell plant.

	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Roman Catholic leaders
expressed dismay at a judge's order to free three of five
Salvadoran National Guardsmen convicted of killing four U.S.
religious workers in 1980.
	   Judge Gloria Platero ruled Wednesday that Daniel Canales
Ramirez, Jose Roberto Moreno Canjura and Luis Colindres were
eligible for immediate parole from their 30-year sentences under a
new law to ease prison overcrowding.
	   Two other guardsmen, Carlos Joaquin Contreras Palacios and
Francisco Orlando Contreras Recinos, were refused release because
of misconduct in prison.
	   The men were convicted of raping and killing Roman Catholic nuns
Dorothy Kazel, Ita Ford, Maura Clark and lay worker Jean Donovan on
a rural road on Dec. 2, 1980, during El Salvador's civil war. The
military saw the nuns as sympathetic to leftist guerrillas.
	   ``It is regrettable that this has happened,'' said Monsignor
Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``It is a bad signal. It is a
bad sympton for those who want a cleaner and purified system of
justice.''
	   Rosa Chavez said the decision to free the men would close
opportunities to learn the full circumstances of the 1980 murders.
	   A nun who had lived alongside the victims, Teresa Alexander,
also expressed sadness at the decision. ``I would have felt better
if they had not received freedom,'' she said.
	   The judge ruled that under a law that took force in April, the
three were eligible for parole because when time for good behavior
is calculated, they have served two-thirds of their 30-year
sentences.
	   Prosecutor Karla Barquero said officials may seek to have the
judge's order overturned. If they do not, the guardsmen would go
free by Tuesday.
	   She argued that none of the men has met a condition that they
must pay reparations to relatives of the victims. Platero said the
judge who sentenced the men had not set any figure for reparations.
	   Salvadoran officials insist the soldiers acted on their own. But
in April, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, a New York group
representing the women's families, said the men now claim they were
following orders from superiors.
	   Church officials and relatives of the women asked for a renewed
investigation into the case.
	   But chief prosecutor Manuel Cordova said in June that it was
``not possible to reopen the case'' because the 10-year statute of
limitations has expired.
	   A U.N. Commission earlier determined that the director of the
National Guard at the time of the slayings, Col. Eugenio Vides
Casanova, and Defense Minister Jose Guillermo Garcia had tried to
cover up the killings.
	   The National Guard was disbanded after a peace agreement in 1992
ended the civil war, during which more than 75,000 people died.
	   If freed, the men must not move without notifying the court,
cannot leave the country, cannot carry arms and must present
themselves before the court each four months. They must also pay a
bond equivalent to dlrs 230.

Singapore economists predict worst recession ever for island 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Threatened by the Asian crisis, Singapore's
vulnerable economy will enter its worst recession ever this year,
economists said Thursday.
	   Singapore's gross domestic product will contract by 1.7 percent
in 1998, according to economist Chen Kang of the Nanyang Technology
University. He said the recession will be the worst in Singapore's
33-year history.
	   During the small city state's last recession in 1985, gross
domestic product shrank by 1.6 percent.
	   Presenting his forecast to a conference held by the Forex
Association of Singapore, Chen said he sees GDP shrinking by 2.7
percent in the second quarter this year, 4.3 percent in the third
and 4.8 percent in the final quarter.
	   The prediction runs counter to government expectations, which
foresee Singapore's economy slowing substantially but avoiding
outright recession.
	   The government revealed earlier this week that it would revise
its optimistic forecast for growth of between 2.5 and 4.5 percent,
which was made in February before the full extent of the Asian
crisis was realized.
	   It also said it would introduce off-budget measures to cushion
the economy when Parliament next meets on Monday.
	   At least five private investment houses have already concluded
that Singapore's economy will shrink this year, and there is a
growing number of other economists and analysts who now feel the
country cannot avoid a contraction.
	   In explaining how they arrived at their prediction, Chen and
another economist at the university, Tan Khee Giap, said their
model was based on an exchange rate of 1.78 Singapore dollars to
the U.S. dollar.
	   On Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 1.656 Singapore dollars,
but has fluctuated wildly between 1.8144 and 1.5799 during the
first half of this year.
	   The two economists said the key contributors to the economic
weakness will be the manufacturing and financial services sectors,
which are set to shrink this year by 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent
respectively.
	   A slump in the global electronics industry because of
overcapacity and a slowdown in corporate demand for computers is
triggering the manufacturing weakness, they said, while the
region's economic crisis is hurting financial services.
	   The economists also see Singapore's commerce sector shrinking 4
percent this year, though the construction sector is expected to
grow by 2.8 percent, while transportation and communications will
expand by 3.3 percent.
	   Tan added that the government should help the country weather
the recession by withholding public land from the property market
to help support prices, bringing forward infrastructure projects
and lowering such business costs as rents on commercial property.

Philippine stocks, peso fall on continuing Japanese woes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks closed lower
Thursday after uneasy investors took advantage of early gains to
take profits, analysts said.
	   The peso also weakened in morning trading in step with other
Asian currencies, which slumped as a result of the weak Japanese
yen, dealers said.
	   Preliminary figures showed the 30-share Philippine Stock
Exchange Index dropping 3.85 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,709.03
after gaining 17.02 points on Wednesday.
	   Losers trounced gainers 57 to 37, with 38 issues unchanged.
	   Lingering concerns over the volatile currency market and
prospects of higher inflation and interest rates prompted stock
investors to cash in on gains at the slightest opportunity,
analysts said.
	   ``Uncertainty still clouds the region, while political
controversies are hounding the local scene,'' said Nestor Aguila,
president of Market Capital and Securities Inc.
	   Hansley Lee, analyst for Abacus Securities Corp., said the
market is now seeking its correct valuation given current economic
realities.
	   It appears, he said, that an economic recovery won't come as
fast as initially expected because of the possible repercussions of
a further slowdown in the Japanese economy.
	   ``A lot of stocks, even those that are fundamentally sound, are
being dragged down by fears over the prospects of the economy,''
Lee said.
	   Securities 2000 Inc. analyst Erwin Balita said many investors
are camping on the sidelines, fearful that the market will retest
the lows hit early this year on the possibility of higher interest
rates.
	   In January, the main index hit a record low of 1,518.
	   ``Interest rates can't stay where they are now given a volatile
currency and the likelihood of inflation hitting around 12
percent,'' Balita said.
	   The central bank's overnight borrowing and lending rates are
currently 13.125 percent and 15.125 percent, respectively.
	   Higher interest rates tend to make fixed income investments more
attractive than stocks.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 41.501 pesos in morning
trading, up from Wednesday's 41.443 pesos.
	   Traders said the currency market continued to look to the
dollar-yen rate for direction.

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas attacked Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon early Thursday, killing two soldiers and
wounding four, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate Israeli comment on the attack, which came
as preparations were underway for the exchange of the remains of an
Israeli soldier killed in South Lebanon last year for bodies of
Lebanese guerrillas and prisoners held by Israel.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group said its fighters
detonated a large bomb early Thursday near an Israeli patrol near
Houla, 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the Israeli border and about 50
kilometers (31 miles) southeast of Sidon, provincial capital of
South Lebanon.
	   A Hezbollah statement said several members of the Israeli elite
``Egoz'' squad were either killed or wounded in the attack.
	   Hezbollah and Lebanese security officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, later said two soldiers were killed and four were
wounded. They gave no details.
	   The statement said Hezbollah fighters detonated another bomb 15
minutes later and raked the area with ``appropriate weapons'' as
reinforcements arrived at the scene.
	   Israeli helicopters and several ambulances were seen rushing to
the targeted area to evacuate the casualties, the statement added.
	   Timur Goksel, a spokesman for a United Nations peacekeeping
force in southern Lebanon, reported heavy firing involving mortars,
rifles and machine guns between Islamic guerrillas and Israeli
forces in the area overnight.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to evict Israeli soldiers who
occupy a swath of southern Lebanon to protect Israel's northern
towns from cross-border attacks.

Investigators: Arson behind hospital fire that killed 25 people 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A fire in a Philippine government
hospital in May that killed 25 people and destroyed much of the
facility was caused by arson, investigators said Thursday.
	   Acting Local Government Secretary Nelson Collantes said the May
16 fire that gutted much of the Lung Center of the Philippines was
``deliberately set.''
	   He said investigators took nearly 40 days to finish their probe
because they wanted to be absolutely sure of their findings.
	   Fire chief Rash Roque of the Inter-Agency Anti-Arson Task Force
said laboratory tests ruled out the possibility that the fire was
caused by an electrical short circuit.
	   ``If it was not an accident that caused the fire, then it must
be arson,'' Collantes said.
	   Collantes said hospital records and several workers are being
checked to determine why the hospital was set on fire.
	   ``We are trying to check on who will benefit as a result of the
fire,'' he said.
	   The fire, the worst ever in a hospital in the Philippines, began
near an intensive care unit and quickly spread throughout the
building. It destroyed eight of the hospital's 10 wards and
millions of pesos (hundreds of thousands of dollars) of hospital
equipment.
	   Most of the dead were found on their beds in two intensive care
units.
	   The fire also spread to the nearby National Kidney Institute,
burning X-ray equipment there.
	   The Lung Center, completed in 1982 under the direction of former
first lady Imelda Marcos, had no sprinkler system or fire hydrants.
	   It is in the same part of metropolitan Manila as a disco where a
fire killed 162 people in 1996. A lack of proper emergency exits
and other violations of fire regulations were blamed for that
tragedy.

Bank of Japan economist: Japan must avoid deflationary spiral 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As domestic demand continues to soften, Japan
must avoid deflationary trends if its struggling economy hopes to
recover, a senior economist with the nations's central bank said
Thursday.
	   At a Singapore conference on regional foreign exchange, the Bank
of Japan's Tsuyoshi Oyama said Japan must also pick up the pace of
solving the many problems that have emerged since the collapse of
its 1980's bubble economy, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
	   This involves restructuring the country's financial system and
upgrading the economy, he said, along with providing more efficient
private financial services for the corporate and household sectors.
	   Oyama said ``the improvement of the fundamental infrastructure,
including corporate accounting practices, information disclosure
and the taxation system must be advanced on an urgent basis.''
	   He added that Japan must promote economic reforms through
administrative deregulation and revision of the tax system.
	   There is a need to revise other areas of the economy too, such
as promoting greater mobility in the labor market, and reforming
the social security system to ease the ``deep-rooted concerns''
regarding the country's future social welfare burden, Oyama said.
	   He said there is also a need to reinforce the functions of
direct financing via the capital markets, which would promote a
better allocation of capital in the economy.
	   Despite the many required changes, he was optimistic that the
government's large-scale fiscal stimulus package, announced earlier
this year, would be implemented immediately. He said that ``its
effect will soon materialize.''

	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ President Bill Clinton flew to China on
Thursday to pursue at the summit, at village roundtables, with
communists and with stockbrokers the East-West relationship he
calls vital to peace and stability in the 21st century.
	   He said he will strive for the advancement of political and
human rights, an issue rankling a Congress divided over his China
policy and investigating his prior deals with Beijing.
	   Clinton said his nine-day mission to China, first by an American
president since George Bush in February 1989, was the right way to
increase America's impact on human rights, nuclear weapons spread
and for cooperation with Beijing to stabilize shaken Asian
economies.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' the president
said at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, where Air Force One
stopped to refuel.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' he told about 4,000 people
who turned out to see him on his way.
	   But even as Clinton flew to China, police arrested two
dissidents in a display of Beijing's hard line against
pro-democracy activists.
	   Clinton's first stop Thursday was Xi'an for an elaborate
welcoming in the ancient walled capital, pageantry dating from
dynasties that flourished a millennium before the first American
colonies. The gritty industrial city surrounding it now was
primped, painted and flag-decked for Clinton's arrival.
	   On Friday (local time), Clinton goes to the village of Xia He
for what is billed as a roundtable discussion with ordinary Chinese
citizens about their lives in a changing society. He'll speak in
the village square. Then Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter,
Chelsea, are tourists for an afternoon, visiting the unearthed
terra cotta warriors, pottery soldiers fashioned to guard an
emperor in the afterlife.
	   Then to Beijing on Saturday, opening with the event that has
stirred the greatest controversy at home: a formal welcoming in
Tiananmen Square, scene of the democracy demonstrations bloodily
repressed by Chinese troops in June 1989.
	   Clinton defends his decision to go to that symbolic site as
protocol, not substance, and said he will speak America's piece for
human rights and freedom. But not there; no speeches at Tiananmen.
	   The president said it would be wrong for him to demand that the
Chinese change the way they welcome world leaders to Beijing, but
``equally wrong for me to go there and take no notice of the
continuing difficulties with human and political rights.''
	   So he said he will do both, the latter, probably, in an address
at Beijing University on Monday.
	   Critics at home, however, kept up the pressure. The House voted
late Wednesday to include in a dlrs 250 billion defense spending
bill a provision that would bar the Pentagon from buying any
product manufactured by the Chinese government or its army.
	   Separately, a senior Pentagon adviser, Peter Leitner, said he
believed business interests had been allowed to override national
security concerns in deals with China.
	   The weekend is the actual summit with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, the joint meetings of U.S. and Chinese officials and the
state banquet at the Great Hall of the People. Clinton and Jiang
are to dine privately Sunday evening.
	   But ceremonies and state visits did not shroud the discordant
notes of U.S.-China relationships. That was dramatized when the
Chinese canceled visas for three reporters of Radio Free Asia, a
U.S.-financed operation that beams broadcasts here, jammed by the
Beijing government.
	   Clinton countered by granting the three a White House interview,
saying the Chinese government made a big mistake, and that ideas do
not need visas. He said he supported Radio Free Asia, not against
the Chinese government but for the advancement of freedom of speech
and debate.
	   Rebuking Beijing, Clinton also disputed his critics, saying they
complain that his journey is more symbolism than substance _ but
that they want him to make it even more symbolic by snubbing
protocol and by seeking out dissidents even though steps like those
could be counterproductive.
	   ``This is a difficult trip because of the differences between
us, but it's also an important trip because of our common interests
and because so much is at stake,'' Clinton said. ``The chances of
doing good for the American people and for the stability of the
world far outweigh dealing with the difficulties.''
	   He said that validates a policy of ``continued, disciplined
engagement.''

Wallaby rescued by police, returned to Australian owner 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A lonely wallaby got lost in a quiet residential
area of Tokyo early Thursday, but was rescued by local police and
returned to its Australian owner.
	   The wallaby, a miniature kangaroo native to Australia, was
initially found by Kokichi Suzuki in front of his house. Suzuki had
stepped outside after his dog began barking at a suspicious looking
creature around 1 a.m., according to police spokesman Norimasa
Sugitani.
	   Sugitani said police were able to catch the wallaby after
rushing to the site following a call from Suzuki.
	   The grayish brown-colored animal, about 1 meter (3.3 feet) long
and wearing a leash, was later returned safely to its keeper, an
Australian journalist living nearby.
	   Names of the wallaby and his owner were not available from
police.

Thai fishermen fight each other over territorial dispute 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 1,000 Thai fishermen have
battled each other with rocks, bottles and sticks in a dispute over
fishing territories, officials said Thursday.
	   Hundreds of deep-sea fishermen from commercial fishing firms
brawled with 1,000 inshore fishermen Wednesday over a government
proposal to demarcate their territory that pleased neither side.
Police separated the brawlers. No one was seriously hurt.
	   The fight erupted outside the town hall in Krabi when talks
mediated by the Fisheries Department broke down over how to divided
up the fishing zone in Phang-nga Bay, 690 kilometers (428 miles)
southwest of Bangkok on the Andaman Sea.
	   The inshore fishermen want the government to triple the size of
a conservation area from which deep-sea trawlers are banned but
small craft are not. The small fishermen say the trawlers are
already intruding into the current conservation territory.
	   The Fisheries Department has agreed in principle to expand the
zone to a little more than half of what the villagers want, but
said more study was needed on the impact on commercial fishing.
	   Both big and small fishermen are going through tough times in
Thailand's current economic crisis, worsened for them by a
dwindling stock of fish.
	   The Thai fishing industry is one of the world's largest and
generates billions of baht (dollars) for the local economy.
	   Local fishing folk have long accused commercial trawlers of
practicing destructive fishing, destroying coral and other marine
life with bottom-dragging nets, and say the government has ignored
their concerns in favor of big operators.

Share prices plunge as ailing bank spells out restructuring plan 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing price, quotes from shareholders; RECASTS
By TODD ZAUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Shares in one of Japan's largest banks plummeted
Thursday as executives spelled out a drastic restructuring plan and
hinted at a possible merger, adding to fears the institution may be
foundering.
	   Share prices in Long-Term Credit Bank dove to 50 yen _ equal to
face value _ within the first hour of trading Thursday, from 70 yen
on Wednesday.
	   LTCB's shares closed down 12 at 58 yen _ still a dangerously low
level that analysts believe, if continued, signals the bank may
have trouble getting further loans.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world
according to Forbes magazine, has become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   Bank officials have repeatedly denied rumors that the bank is on
the verge of failure, but they recently acknowledged it holds some
1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans.
	   At the bank's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, officials
detailed plans announced in February to shut down about half of its
overseas outlets and cut staff by 20 percent.
	   LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi told stockholders the bank was
considering a merger but refused to name any potential partners. He
denied reports the bank would merge with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
	   Onogi said plans announced last July for a partnership with
Swiss Bank Corp. were still on, saying the alliance was key to
recovering its financial health.
	   The two banks said then that they would tie up in investment
banking, asset management and private banking.
	   Stockholders complained Thursday that the bank offered no new
solutions to its slump.
	   ``The stock has fallen so far that there is nothing for me to do
but hold on and hope,'' said Yoshitsugi Takahashi, 61, who has seen
his 2,000 shares fall from about 1,400 yen each.
	   Japan's government, meanwhile, is racing to set up an emergency
bank to provide loans to cash-strapped companies left out in the
cold by private banks struggling with bad loans.
	   But investors are concerned the government may be willing to let
some weak institutions go under in order to strengthen the overall
financial system.
	   That concern began to focus on LTCB last week, after Moody's
Investors Services lowered its credit rating for the bank and sent
its share prices plunging.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, with 3,600 employees and 28 trillion
(dlrs 203 billion) in assets, is one of three credit banks
established at the end of World War II to provide long-term
business loans in an effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
	   But deregulation has made it easier for companies to raise money
directly by issuing stocks or selling bonds, and the banks' role
has been largely lost.

Australia welcomes Habibie-Belo talks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Talks between Indonesia's President
B.J. Habibie and East Timorese leader Bishop Carlos Belo were a
step towards ending conflict over the disputed territory,
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Thursday.
	   Welcoming the talks, held Wednesday in Jakarta, Downer said
Australia has consistently advocated a reduction in Indonesia's
military presence on East Timor, which Indonesia invaded in 1975
and annexed in 1976.
	   ``It is pleasing, therefore, that President Habibie has
indicated that he is prepared to reduce the number of troops in
East Timor and to explore the granting of a greater degree of
autonomy,'' Downer told Parliament.
	   ``These talks have been very helpful in terms of taking the
issue of East Timor forward.''
	   Downer said the Australian government has also urged that the
people of East Timor be given a greater say in their own affairs.
	   ``East Timor is a deeply divided and troubled place. A
satisfactory resolution of the problems facing East Timor will
require the development of a dialogue amongst the people of East
Timor and of course with the government in Jakarta,'' Downer said.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks finish slightly higher prices 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Thursday
despite fears of possible intervention by Japan's central bank.
Tokyo stocks finished the day's trading slightly lower.
	   The dollar bought 140.86 yen at mid-afternoon, up 0.50 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 141.25
yen overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
added 9.04 points, or 0.06 percent, closing at 15,132.22. On
Wednesday, the index closed up 68.58 points, or 0.46 percent.
	   Early in the session, the dollar-buying trend accelerated after
a Japanese newspaper reported Thursday that the Chinese government
was seriously considering devaluing its currency, the yuan, if the
dollar rises to 160 yen, dealers said.
	   The Tokyo Shimbun, quoting unidentified Chinese sources in
Beijing, said the issue of the yuan could be one of the topics to
be discussed at the Sino-U.S. summit on Saturday in Beijing.
	   ``If China won't devalue until 160 yen (to the dollar), traders
can continue buying dollars,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior
trader at Sanwa Bank.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, vice minister for international affairs at
Japan's Finance Ministry, said Thursday that Japan will intervene
in foreign exchange markets when necessary.
	   ``When it is appropriate, we will intervene, when it isn't
appropriate, we won't,'' Sakakibara told reporters.
	   Separately, Haruhiko Kuroda, the head of the international
bureau at the same ministry, told reporters that he was
``concerned'' about recent movements in foreign exchange markets.
	   Last week, Japan and the United States sold dollars and bought
yen to reverse growing weakness in the Japanese currency, which had
fallen to eight-year lows.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.60 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,185.53. The
TOPIX rose 5.51 points, or 0.47 percent, the previous day.
	   Trading on the stock market remained sparse as shares of the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan dropped, rekindling concerns about
Japan's banking industry.
	   LTCB shares fell to their par value of 50 yen during the morning
before recovering slightly to end the day's session at 58 yen, down
12 yen from Wednesday's close.
	   Many investors retreated to the sidelines as they watched the
government's progress in mapping out steps to revive the ailing
financial sector.
	   Among gainers were technology shares, which drew investors'
interest in line with overnight gains of similar issues on Wall
Street.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.210 percent from Tuesday's 1.260 percent,
driving its price up to 111.96 yen from 111.53 yen.

UNDATED: straight game Dodgers 6, Angels 5, 11 innings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Los Angeles, Trenidad Hubbard's RBI single in the 11th
boosted Los Angeles over Anaheim and gave new Dodger manager Glenn
Hoffman his first win in three tries.
	   After the Dodgers' Antonio Osuna (4-0) threw two shutout
innings, the Dodgers scored their game-winner on a single by Matt
Luke off Greg Cadaret (1-1), a stolen base, infield out and
Hubbard's base hit.
	   Cadaret started the 11th for the Angels, who had a four-game
winning streak snapped and saw their AL-West lead over Texas shrink
to 2 1/2 games. The Dodgers' bullpen, which had blown leads in
losses the two previous nights against the Angels, allowed Anaheim
to rally from a 5-2 deficit this time.
 &UR; Rockies 8, Astros 6 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Dante Bichette and Todd Helton each homered as the
Colorado Rockies overcame a six-run deficit and two homers by Jeff
Bagwell to beat the Houston Astros.
	   Bagwell's three-run homer in the first inning gave him 200 for
his career, and he added a two-run shot in the third for his 12th
career multi-homer game. He has 14 homers this season.
	   Despite giving up both blasts, Colorado's Pedro Astacio (5-8)
regrouped to win for the first time in seven starts. He allowed six
runs on five hits in eight innings. Dave Veres pitched the ninth
for his second save.
	   Bichette tied it at 6 with a solo homer, his 10th, against Sean
Bergman (6-4) leading off the Colorado fifth. Vinny Castilla
followed with a triple and scored on Ellis Burks' groundout to
shortstop.

Indonesia, IMF sign new agreement over economic bailout 
</HEADLINE>

By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia and the International
Monetary Fund said Thursday they had signed a new agreement to
restart a dlrs 43 billion economic bailout for the world's fourth
most populous nation.
	   The deal calls for tough reforms while balancing the social
needs of tens of millions hit hard by the worst financial crisis in
30 years.
	   Indonesia's top economic minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said
the accord was signed on Wednesday. He made the announcement at a
news conference at Indonesia's presidential palace accompanied by
the IMF's most senior official in Asia, Hubert Neiss.
	   Thursday's agreement, follows weeks of negotiations, and is the
fourth struck by Indonesia and the IMF since last October.
	   ``The new agreement has been signed with the IMF,'' said
Ginandjar, who is coordinating minister for the economy, finance
and industry.
	   Under the latest plan, Indonesia has recommitted itself to
making good on previous promises for sweeping reforms, such as a
tightening of the shaky banking system, debt reduction and greater
financial and government transparency.
	   At the same time the IMF has approved boosts to social welfare
and other spending to help cushion millions of poor from the
effects of tough changes needed to fix the battered economy.
	   Greater spending on health, education and job creation would be
made. Many fear that without this, social unrest, which rocked
Indonesia in May, might flare again.
	   Neiss hailed the deal and predicted further international aid
would be sought to help Indonesia.
	   ``It will clear the way for further international financial
assistance which, at this point, Indonesia urgently needs,'' Neiss
said of the agreement.
	   Under the deal a growing budget deficit, made necessary by
increased social welfare spending, would be largely covered by
international loans.
	   Asia's financial meltdown has hit Indonesia the hardest of all
the economies in the region.
	   The value of the rupiah has dropped more than 80 percent in the
past 11 months. Inflation is soaring and unemployment is climbing
as hundreds of companies find themselves unable to cope with
massive debt.
	   Poverty rates are expected to rise dramatically in coming
months.
	   The crisis climaxed last month when protests degenerated into
riots. More than 1,200 people died in the violence, which helped
force former authoritarian President Suharto to quit, ending 32
years in power.
	   Several attempts to implement previous bailout agreements were
stymied when Suharto failed to deliver on promises to the IMF to
reform the economy.
	   Critics accused him of wanting to protect the vast business
empires of his super-rich children and friends, who had profited
from a web of subsidies, tax breaks and other benefits under
Suharto's patronage.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised to make
sweeping political reforms and cooperate fully with the IMF.
	   The IMF suspended scheduled bailout payments to Indonesia after
last month's political turmoil.
	   Now that Habibie's administration has made a new commitment to
change, payments are expected to restart soon.
	   Neiss said the Washington-based fund's executive board would
meet by mid-July to decide whether payments should go ahead.
	   However, both Ginandjar and Neiss made it clear that tough times
still lay ahead.
	   They said Indonesia's gross domestic product this year would
contract by at least 10 percent, deepening a grinding recession.
	   They predicted the rupiah would trade at 10,000 rupiah to the
dollar or worse by the end of 1998, compared with about 14,000
rupiah now and 2,400 when the crisis started in July 1997.

Princess Diana's brother defends controversial eulogy at his sister's funeral garble in overline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS more details of interview on conspiracy theories; fixes
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's brother, says he
did not intend to attack anyone in the now-famous eulogy at her
funeral in which he swore that her ``blood family'' would help
ensure her sons were not simply immersed in duty and tradition, but
that their souls could sing.
	   Asked by a BBC-TV interviewer Wednesday night if he was
surprised that the eulogy was interpreted as a criticism of the
royal family, he said, ``I wasn't taking swipes at any one.''
	   ``Diana brought to their lives something quite different and
wonderful and I was just offering in any way that her surviving
family could help to perpetuate that,'' he said during a
documentary on the Spencer family home, where he is about to open a
museum exhibition on Diana.
	   ``I'm pleased that I said what I said for Diana. And judging
from the letters I get from the public _ I got 200,000 letters,
people were in agreement that it needed to be said,'' he said.
	   Although his sister had been married to Prince Charles for 15
years, Spencer also said he didn't know members of the royal family
``on a level of any significance'' except for his two nephews and
said he was ``certainly not going to sit here and criticize their
relatives.''
	   Spencer reiterated his family's flat rejection of claims by
Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed, whose son Dodi died in the Aug. 31
Paris car crash with Diana, that the deaths were not an accident.
	   ``I am not a conspiracy theorist and I think they are
particularly unfortunate in going over them again and again _ for
the boys more than anyone,'' he said. ``It is not much fun for my
family either.''
	   He also dismissed claims that his sister was set to marry Dodi
Fayed, saying their relationship had not gone past the ``heady
stage.''
	   The earl said claims made by Al Fayed that the couple were
engaged the night they were killed were ``ridiculous.''
	   He said he and his family were not aware of any plans for
marriage.
	   ``It is speculation as to what might have happened or what might
not have happened. It is completely ridiculous,'' he said.

Incoming Filipino government will not intervene to support peso 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The incoming Philippine government will not
intervene to prop up the weakening peso, Finance
Secretary-designate Edgardo Espiritu said Thursday.
	   Set to assume power in five days, the new administration's key
objective will be to reduce interest rates rather than prevent the
peso from declining, Espiritu said in a televised interview with
satellite broadcaster CNBC.
	   The new government has ``agreed we'll not support or intervene
in the matter of the Philippine currency'' even though ``our
objective is to protect the currency from speculative attack or
violent changes,'' he said.
	   The peso continued its fall Thursday, along with other Asian
currencies slumping as a result of the weak Japanese yen. It
averaged about 41.5 pesos against the U.S. dollar in morning
trading.
	   Espiritu said lowering the country's interest rates was a more
immediate concern than the falling peso.
	   ``The regime of high interest rates is a nightmare to all of us
in the country,'' he said. ``It's one of the first problems we have
to face because we don't want to see continuous fallout in the
business sector.''
	   Espiritu had said Wednesday during a gathering of international
political and business leaders in Singapore that he sees interest
rates falling to 14 percent from the current high of 15.5 percent.

Police detain dissident in Xi'an: Clinton's first stop in China 
</HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police detained a dissident at the first stop in
President Clinton's China itinerary and continued their tight
surveillance of other democracy activists, a human rights group
said Thursday.
	   Yan Jun, a dissident in Xi'an who joined in a letter signed by
70 people asking Clinton to meet dissidents while in China, was
taken away from his home Wednesday, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Yan's whereabouts were unknown Thursday, the Hong Kong-based
group added. Yan was sentenced to five years in prison in 1996 but
later acquitted for having written a letter to China's legislature
asking for strict punishment of a former Beijing mayor charged with
corruption, the group said.
	   Letters and petitions are among the few recourses for Chinese
who want to take issue with government policy. Even former
Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang, under house arrest since the
1989 crackdown on democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square,
has resorted to penning his grievances.
	   The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported Wednesday that
Zhao had written a letter to party leaders urging them to use the
occasion of Clinton's visit to reconsider their condemnation of the
Tiananmen protests as ``counterrevolutionary turmoil.''
	   One Chinese source with contacts to Zhao's family said he
believed the letter was penned with Zhao's knowledge, if not by
Zhao himself. Zhao is not allowed contact with the media, and
former associates of his reached by phone said that while they had
not seen any letter, its message was in keeping with Zhao's point
of view.
	   ``I certainly believe it represents Zhao's point of view,'' said
former aide Bao Tong, who spent seven years in prison for his
association with the liberal leader. ``The whole world can
understand his point of view.''
	   Clinton was due to arrive in Xi'an Thursday evening, kicking off
his nine-day visit, the first by a U.S. president since Chinese
troops crushed the Tiananmen protests in 1989.
	   In a radio interview before his departure Wednesday, Clinton
said he wanted his trip to be a springboard for the causes of
democracy and freedom in China's closed society.
	   Meanwhile, police informed the wife of another dissident taken
from his home Wednesday that he was being held in the southern city
of Guilin, one of the five cities on Clinton's itinerary.
	   Jiang Hangxia said police told her that her husband, Li
Xiaolong, would be freed and allowed to return home in three days
``if there were no problems.''
	   But police refused to say why he had been detained, she said. Li
had previously been on the run from police for fear of arrest for
pro-democracy activities but slipped home Tuesday night to see his
two children.
	   Meanwhile, veteran Beijing activist Xu Wenli said police on a
motorbike and in a car followed him Thursday when he took his wife
out for a homecoming dinner following her two-month trip to the
United States to visit their daughter.
	   Four of Xu's friends who tried to visit him Tuesday also were
detained, questioned and then released, he said.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center said that apart from
raising human rights in his summit Saturday with President Jiang
Zemin, Clinton also should pressure local leaders on his tour of
China for releases of political prisoners.
	   It cited two cases in Shaanxi, the first province on Clinton's
itinerary. One was a democracy activist detained in March after he
tried to run for local office. The other was a teacher serving a
five year prison sentence for co-writing an article with Wang Dan,
one of China's most famous dissidents now in exile in the United
States.

Two Israeli soldiers killed, four wounded in south Lebanon casualties and swap, details, ADDS byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Israeli retaliation, background on Israeli
By AHMED MANTASH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas attacked Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon early Thursday, killing two soldiers and
wounding four, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate Israeli comment on the guerrilla roadside
bombings and heavy gunfire.
	   In retaliation, Israeli helicopters strafed guerrilla
infiltration trails with machine guns, and ground guns fired 15
mortar bombs and about 40 shells of 155 mm caliber, the officials
said. There was no word on casualties.
	   The attack came as preparations were underway to return the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed in South Lebanon last year in
exchange for bodies of Lebanese guerrillas and prisoners held by
Israel.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah said in a statement that its
fighters detonated two bomb within a space of 15 minutes near an
Israeli patrol and raked the area with ``appropriate weapons'' as
reinforcements arrived at the scene.
	   Hezbollah and Lebanese security officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said two soldiers were killed and four were wounded.
They gave no details.
	   Israeli helicopters and several ambulances were seen rushing to
the area to evacuate the casualties, the statement added.
	   The attack occurred near Houla, 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the
Israeli border and about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of
Sidon, provincial capital of South Lebanon. Large parts of the area
are occupied by Israel and Hezbollah and other militias are
fighting to evict Israeli soldiers.
	   Timur Goksel, a spokesman for a United Nations peacekeeping
force in southern Lebanon, reported heavy firing from both sides
involving mortars, machine guns and big jeep-mounted rifles capable
of knocking out tanks.
	   The incident is unlikely to affect the prisoner and body
exchange, which was agreed upon after 10 months of tortuous
negotiations involving the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
	   Thursday's fatalities raised to eight killed and 62 wounded the
number of Israeli losses in southern Lebanon this year. The last
Israeli casualties in South Lebanon were on May 28 when two
soldiers were killed in an ambush.
	   In 1997, 39 Israeli soldiers were killed in guerrilla attacks, a
record annual figure since 1985 when Israel declared the occupied
area a security zone meant to protect its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.
	   Among last year's dead were 12 soldiers killed in a botched
commando raid on Sept. 5. The Israelis recovered all except one
body _ that of Sgt. Itamar Ilya whose remains are at the crux of
the imminent swap.
	   News reports in Lebanon and Israel have said that Ilya's remains
will be returned home later Thursday and Israel will hand over the
bodies of 40 guerrillas and release more than 60 prisoners.
	   Some of the prisoners are held in Israel but most are detained
in the occupied zone in the south.

MetroStars down Revolution 5-3 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Fire-Wizards game
<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Rookie defender Mike Petke
snapped a 3-3 tie with the first goal of his professional career in
the 69th minute Wednesday as the New York-New Jersey MetroStars
beat New England 5-3, the Revolution's seventh straight loss.
	   The victory was the sixth in eight games for the MetroStars
(9-7), who moved into second place in the MLS Eastern Conference
one point ahead of the idle Columbus Crew.
	   Petke, the MetroStars' first-round pick out of Southern
Connecticut, had just one assist in his first 12 appearances.
	   Although the MetroStars dominated the first half, it was the
Revolution (4-10) who tallied first when Raul Diaz Arce notched his
ninth goal of the season in the 31st minute.
	   Diaz Arce beat an offside trap and ran onto a through pass from
Oscar Pareja then beat MetroStars goalkeeper Tony Meola with his
shot into the far corner from a sharp right angle.
	   New York-New Jersey equalized in the 40th minute on a goal set
up by a brilliant individual effort by Paul Dougherty. The
diminutive midfielder dribbled past his defender and ripped a shot
off the bar. The shot rebounded to teammate Brian Kelly who headed
the rebound home.
	   The MetroStars made it 2-1 less than two minutes before the
interval after New England defender Ivan McKinley was called for a
handball in the penalty box. Revolution keeper Ian Feuer was able
to deflect Diego Senora's penalty kick off the post but Giovanni
Savarese pounced on the rebound and tucked in home for his eighth
goal of the year.
	   Kelly added his second goal of the match in the 53rd minute
heading in a cross from Senora.
	   But New England battled back to tie the game on Edwin Gorter's
goal in the 64th minute and Diaz-Arce's second score of the match
in the 68th minute.
	   That set the stage for Petke who drilled his game-winning goal
into the upper right corner of the net from the top of the box.
Dougherty added an insurance goal in the 87th minute giving the
MetroStars a team record for goals in a match.
 &UR; Fire 4, Wizards 1 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Roman Kosecki had two goals and an assist as the
Chicago Fire won for the ninth straight time, beating the Kansas
City Wizards 4-1.
	   Chicago tied the Los Angeles Galaxy with the league's longest
winning streak of the season. The Fire's streak is also the
third-longest in Major League Soccer history.
	   Kansas City (6-9) opened the scoring in the 15th minute with a
rocket by Mo Johnston from 28 yards out, but the rest of the game
belonged to Chicago (11-5).
	   Ante Razov put the Fire on the board in the 26th minute with an
assist by Kosecki. C.J. Brown gave Chicago a 2-1 halftime lead when
he netted a towering header off a corner kick by Peter Nowak.
	   Kosecki put the game out of reach in the second half with goals
in the 56th and 75th minutes. The Polish native shot high from
close range for his first goal and curled a shot into the upper
right corner from 20 yards out for his second.

Panel finds possible cancer link to electric fields 
</HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The controversial theory that electric fields
such as those around power lines can cause cancer is getting a
boost from a federal agency panel.
	   Though divided, the National Institutes of Health panel voted
Wednesday that such electromagnetic fields should be considered
``possible human carcinogens.''
	   ``This report does not suggest the risk is high,'' said Michael
Gallo, chairman of the group.
	   Indeed, the risk ``is probably quite small compared to many
other public health risks,'' said Gallo.
	   The new report comes from a National Institutes of Environmental
Health Sciences panel convened to review scientific research on
electromagnetic fields.
	   Completing 10 days of discussions, the group voted 19-9 on
Wednesday that electromagnetic fields should be regarded a
potential cause of cancer.
	   Eight members said that, because of conflicting studies, they
could not decide whether electrical fields were potential cancer
causers. One said they probably are not.
	   Linda Schoumacher of the Edison Electric Institute, which
represents the electrical industry, said it would be premature to
comment on the report, but that her organization will study it.
	   The new finding is at odds with a 1996 report by a National
Research Council panel of scientists who evaluated about 500
studies on the health effects of high voltage power lines and found
``no conclusive and consistent evidence'' that electric and
magnetic fields cause any human disease.
	   Studies of the incidence of disease analyzed by the new NIH
group found a slight increase in childhood leukemia risk for
youngsters whose homes are near power lines and an increase in
chronic leukemia in adults working in industries where they are
exposed to intensive electric fields.
	   The group said there wasn't enough evidence to link household
exposure to power lines to cancer in adults or to associate
electromagnetic fields to such diseases as Alzheimer's disease,
depression and birth defects.
	   Though the link between electricity and disease has long been
controversial, some consumer groups have sued power companies or
forced utility firms to move power lines or install shielding.

South Korea to auction off two bankrupt companies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will put two heavily
indebted car and steel companies up for international auction by
October, government officials said Thursday.
	   Officials at the Ministry of Finance and Economy said the
government plans to take bids for Kia Motors Co. in mid-July and
Hanbo Steel Co. in September.
	   Both Kia and Hanbo are under court receivership after going
bankrupt in 1997.
	   The move to sell both companies is the latest in the
government's efforts to restructure the nation's economy under the
terms of a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Kia Motors, the nation's third largest car-maker, went bankrupt
almost a year ago under the weight of dlrs 1 billion in bank loans.
	   The government is Kia's largest stockholder, with a 30 percent
stake. U.S. car giant Ford holds 16.9 percent, with remaining
shares owned by thousands of small investors, including Kia
employees.
	   Ford is one of Kia's major takeover candidates. The other
candidates include Hyundai Motors Co. and Daewoo Motors Co., the
nation's leading car producers.
	   Hanbo is South Korea's second largest steel-maker. It collapsed
in January last year with dlrs 3.6 billion in bank loans
outstanding. No domestic investors could be found to take it over.

Imelda Marcos postpones burial of Ferdinand Marcos in heroes' cemetery saying he will wait for court ruling before allowing burial, expressing surprise at extent of opposition; ADDS byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS throughout with President-elect Estrada

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former first lady Imelda Marcos
backed off Thursday from a plan to bury her husband, dictator
Ferdinand Marcos, in a heroes' cemetery because of widespread
opposition that threatened the popularity of the Philippines'
president-elect.
	   ``In the spirit of national interest, our family is prepared to
wait,'' Mrs. Marcos said in a statement. ``The burial of the late
President Marcos will be deferred to a more appropriate time.''
	   The emotion-charged dispute over whether Marcos should be buried
at Heroes' Cemetery in metropolitan Manila nearly nine years after
dying in exile in 1989 has reopened old wounds and divided
Filipinos.
	   The plan to bury Marcos on July 11 had been approved by
President-elect Joseph Estrada, a former Marcos supporter who takes
office June 30. Estrada told reporters Thursday he was surprised at
the extent of the opposition because he thought burying Marcos
would put the issue to rest.
	   Since Estrada announced his approval, widespread opposition had
eroded the massive popular support he received in last month's
elections.
	   Officials close to Estrada say they arranged for an intermediary
to visit Mrs. Marcos to ask her to delay the burial, although
Estrada claimed Thursday that he had not personally sent anyone to
talk to her.
	   Marcos' 20-year rule ended in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986.
After he died in Hawaii, his body was not allowed to return to the
Philippines until September 1993. Since then, it has been kept in a
glass coffin in an air-conditioned mausoleum in his northern
hometown.
	   Both President Fidel Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon Aquino,
refused to let Marcos' body be brought to Manila, fearing conflicts
between the former strongman's supporters and opponents.
	   Ramos ordered a halt Tuesday to construction of Marcos' grave at
the cemetery for the week remaining in his term.
	   In recent days, there have been almost daily demonstrations
against the planned burial. On Tuesday, opponents launched a
``Marcos is No Hero'' movement, saying that instead of
reconciliation, the burial at the cemetery, where many soldiers who
died in battle are buried, would cause new divisions.
	   Some relatives of soldiers buried in the cemetery said they
planned to transfer their dead elsewhere if Marcos' burial went
ahead. Other critics said they plan to seek a court injunction
against the burial, and Estrada said Thursday he will now wait for
a court ruling.
	   ``This time I will wait for the decision of the court,'' he
said.
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial at the cemetery is appropriate
because he was a veteran who fought during World War II.
	   The government accuses the late president and his associates of
illegally amassing billions of dollars during his 20-year rule.
Marcos' government also was accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents.

Iraq rejects prolonging of sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Saying it will ``not yield to oppression,''
Iraq on Thursday insisted it has no more illegal weapons to
declare, and that U.N. sanctions must be lifted immediately.
	   The latest row over the VX nerve gas ``is aimed at maintaining
the status quo ... This is not possible and no one is ready to
accept it,'' the ruling Baath Party newspaper al-Thawra said in a
commentary.
	   ``Regarding further documents (on weapons), Iraq cannot provide
what it does not have,'' it said. ``Iraq shall not yield to this
oppression.''
	   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday agreed to extend the
sanctions by another two months after chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler reported that a U.S. Army laboratory found traces of
VX on Iraqi missile warheads.
	   Also Wednesday, Iraq warned it will take action against the
United Nations inspectors if the sanctions, imposed for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, were not lifted immediately.
	   State-controlled newspapers re-published Thursday a statement
Iraqi leaders had issued on May 1, warning the Security Council of
unspecified ``grave consequences'' if the embargo is not removed.
	   Iraq says the U.S. tests are incorrect and a fabrication. The
government says that its scientists experimented with VX but were
never able to produce weapons grade material, and the gas was
certainly never mounted on weapons.
	   ``I am surprised. We know very well VX was never weaponized. We
know this. We have done this ourselves ... Now how did the VX
appear there (on missile warheads) we have no idea,'' Lt. Gen. Amer
al-Saadi, a presidential adviser and father of Iraq's chemical
warfare program, told reporters late Wednesday.
	   Al-Saadi said he could not believe the result of the test but
declined comment on whether Baghdad thought the outcome was
tampered with by U.S. scientists.
	   He welcomed a decision by Butler to ask laboratories in France
and Switzerland to confirm findings of U.S. Army scientists.
	   If the tests were taken ``in a proper and a secure way,''
al-Saadi said, he was confident they will prove Iraq's claim.
	   Asked what Iraq would do if the French and Swiss tests uphold
the outcome by U.S. Army scientists, al-Saadi said: ``We are going
to talk about it again.''
	   He said the U.N. Special Commission overseeing the elimination
of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction has become ``an adversary''
and the VX issue is bound to damage confidence between the two
sides.
	   The U.S. lab was testing missile warhead fragments recovered by
U.N. inspectors from a dump site where the Iraqis had disposed of
their illegal weapons under the terms of a cease-fire agreement
that ended the 1991 Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait.
	   Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of weapons of mass
destruction, the Security Council will not lift the sanctions.

Chirac launches new Africa policy with trip to southern Africa 
</HEADLINE>

By PAT REBER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac set
foot for the first time in southern Africa on Thursday,
establishing a new economic and political beachhead that is key to
France's new African policy.
	   President Sam Nujoma, 69, greeted Chirac who landed just as the
winter sun got high enough to burn off the morning chill.
	   ``You see those mountains, they are full of uranium, copper and
oil. We need the French geologist to help develop them,'' Nujoma
told journalists shortly before Chirac's plane touched down.
	   Chirac is making a one-day visit to this capital, 360 kilometers
(223 miles) inland from the continent's southwest Atlantic
coastline.
	   With his arrival amidst the wheat colored mountains and thorn
acacia plains surrounding the capital city, Chirac began a six-day
trip that will also take him to South Africa, Mozambique and
Angola.
	   The tour comes less than a year after France launched major
changes in its Africa policies away from involvement in her former
West African colonies.
	   Close relations with post-apartheid South Africa, the dominant
nation of the region, play a central role in the new orientation.
	   Commercial and economic interests appear to dominate the move,
but France also wants to hedge increasing U.S. influence in Africa.
	   France has been criticized for propping up dictators in
countries like the former Zaire and Rwanda, and the new policy
calls for reducing the number of French troops and helping instead
to train African peacekeeping forces.
	   Like U.S. President Bill Clinton when he visited Africa earlier
this year, Chirac is traveling with top business people to explore
investment and trade opportunities.
	   ``France wants to offer these countries an opportunity to extend
their horizon,'' said presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna at
a Paris briefing before the trip.
	   Chirac's stops in Namibia, Angola and Mozambique are the first
visits ever by a French president. The late President Francois
Mitterand visited South Africa soon after Nelson Mandela was
elected president in 1994.
	   Later Thursday Chirac is to confer with Nujoma, elected in
Namibia's first democratic elections in 1989. Before that, Nujoma
was in exile for 30 years when South Africa ruled the territory
that is larger than Texas and Louisiana combined (or two-thirds the
size of South Africa).
	   Also on the one-day Namibian itinerary is a visit to a school in
Katutura, a black township where 30,000 Namibians were forced to
live after being uprooted from their homes in 1958 under apartheid
rule.
	   Namibia was hailed as a model of democracy when it broke away
from South Africa. But now the semi-arid country of 1.6 million
people is edging toward one-party rule by the South West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO) that waged the bush war against South
Africa.
	   Economic growth has fallen from 7.6 percent in 1992 to 2.6
percent in 1996 in this diamond and mineral-rich country.

Singapore official proposes global boycott of Indonesian firms setting fires 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ To help combat Southeast Asia's haze troubles,
an influential Singapore official has urged a global boycott of
companies setting fires to clear Indonesian jungle, a news report
said Thursday.
	   ``Let us publish the names of the companies, their owners and
senior management,'' Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh was quoted as
saying in The Straits Times. ``If necessary, we can request that
our friends in the West boycott their products.''
	   Palm plantations and logging companies in Indonesia are blamed
for setting fires over the past year that sent a blanket of haze
spreading across Southeast Asia, choking millions of people and
emitting huge quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
	   Conservative estimates of the total global cost of the haze
reach dlrs 4.5 billion, including lost agriculture and timber,
health problems, declining tourism, and a host of other ill
effects.
	   Environmentalists say more than a million of hectares (2.5
million acres) of Indonesian forest were affected by the fires,
which were exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   Koh said he has called upon private organizations, which seem to
be assuming a greater profile in plans to combat the fires and
haze, to ``launch a campaign to expose the wrong-doers.''
	   Environment ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations have met repeatedly since the start of the year to discuss
the haze, but ASEAN's longstanding philosophy of non-interference
in its member's internal affairs is considered by many as an
obstacle to quickly resolving the problem.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   But since the haze has become a trans-boundary problem, outside
pressure for change in Indonesia has been mounting from within
ASEAN and other neighbors.
	   The fires and resulting haze have subsided with the easing of El
Nino. But with the dry season reaching its high point soon, there
are widespread fears that the conflagration could begin again.

Independent gives Labor government, denies One Nation a role leader 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comment from prime minister and One Nation
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Labor Party will form
a minority government in Queensland state following the
announcement Thursday by an independent legislator that he will
give the party his crucial support.
	   Almost two weeks after Queensland voters went to the polls, the
knife-edge result was decided when independent Peter Wellington
said he would support Labor, which was one seat short of a majority
in the 89-seat state parliament after the June 13 poll.
	   The outcome denies the right-wing nationalist One Nation party
any role in government.
	   One Nation has sent shockwaves through Australian politics by
capturing 23 percent of the vote in its first electoral test,
severely eroding support for the conservative coalition that held
power in the state and which Prime Minister John Howard heads
nationally.
	   Howard said Thursday One Nation voters were partly to blame for
Labor winning power in Queensland because they did not give their
vote to the coalition.
	   ``Those who voted One Nation in protest at the coalition parties
will no doubt contemplate the irony of having helped elect a Labor
government,'' he said.
	   One Nation spokesman David Oldfield said Hanson would remind
Labor leader Peter Beattie that he does not have the support of a
majority of voters.
	   ``She hopes that he will realize that he does not have a
mandate, he had 39 percent of the primary vote,'' Oldfield said.
	   The state coalition had been trying to maintain power by
securing the support in parliament of the 11 One Nation
legislators, Wellington and one other independent, Liz Cunningham.
	   All Labor required was the vote of one of the independents. With
Wellington's vote, Labor will have a one-vote majority and is now
able to form a government.
	   ``I am of the view that the Labor party is best able to provide
stable government for the next three years,'' he said.
	   Beattie, who previously ruled out governing with One Nation
support, held meetings with both independents Wednesday.
	   Outgoing Premier Rob Borbidge officially resigned his commission
following Wellington's announcement.
	   Beattie will be sworn in by state Governor Peter Arnison _ the
Queen's representative in the state _ on Friday and will be
caretaker premier until the appointment is confirmed by a vote of
confidence at the first sitting of the state parliament next week.

Two Israeli soldiers killed, four wounded in south Lebanon casualties and swap, details, ADDS byline 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Israeli retaliation, background on Israeli
By AHMED MANTASH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas attacked Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon early Thursday, killing two soldiers and
wounding four, Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate Israeli comment on the guerrilla roadside
bombings and ambush.
	   In retaliation, Israeli helicopters strafed guerrilla
infiltration trails with machine guns, and Israeli artillery and
mortars opened fire, the officials said. There was no word on
casualties.
	   The guerrilla attack came as preparations were under way to
return the remains of an Israeli soldier killed in South Lebanon
last year in exchange for bodies of Lebanese guerrillas and the
release of prisoners held by Israel.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group said its fighters
detonated a large bomb early Thursday near an Israeli patrol near
Houla, 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the Israeli border and about 50
kilometers (30 miles) southeast of Sidon, provincial capital of
South Lebanon.
	   The statement said Hezbollah fighters detonated another bomb 15
minutes later and raked the area with ``appropriate weapons'' as
Israeli reinforcements arrived at the scene.
	   Hezbollah and Lebanese security officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said two Israeli soldiers were killed and four
wounded. They gave no details.
	   Israeli helicopters and several ambulances were seen rushing to
the area to evacuate the casualties, the Hezbollah statement added.
	   Timur Goksel, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in
southern Lebanon, reported heavy firing from both sides involving
mortars, machine guns and big jeep-mounted rifles capable of
knocking out tanks.
	   The incident is unlikely to affect the prisoner and body
exchange, which was agreed upon after 10 months of tortuous
negotiations involving the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
	   Thursday's fatalities raised Israeli losses in southern Lebanon
to eight killed and 62 wounded so far this year. The last Israeli
casualties in south Lebanon were on May 28 when two soldiers were
killed in an ambush.
	   In 1997, 39 Israeli soldiers were killed in guerrilla attacks, a
record annual figure since 1985 when Israel declared the occupied
area a security zone meant to protect its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.
	   Among last year's dead were 12 soldiers killed in a botched
commando raid on Sept. 5. The Israelis recovered all except one
body _ that of Sgt. Itamar Ilya whose remains are at the crux of
the imminent swap.
	   News reports in Lebanon and Israel have said that Ilya's remains
will be returned home later Thursday. In return, Israel will hand
over the bodies of 40 guerrillas and release more than 60
prisoners.
	   Some of the prisoners are held in Israel but most are detained
in the occupied zone in the south. Large parts of southern Lebanon
are occupied by Israel and an allied Lebanese militia, Hezbollah
and other guerrilla groups are fighting to oust the Israelis.

World Cup gambling arrests in Thailand top 300 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police said Thursday they have arrested
351 people in Thailand for gambling on the World Cup soccer
tournament since it began two weeks ago.
	   If convicted, those arrested could be fined up to 5,000 baht
(dlrs 120) and imprisoned for up to to three years.
	   Most of the suspects were bookies, against whom police would
seek the maximum penalty, said police Col. Angkul Atornphatai, a
member of a special task force to suppress soccer gambling.
	   Of the arrests, 103 were in the capital, Bangkok.
	   Thais are expected to spend 30 billion baht (dlrs 714 million)
betting on the tournament, the Thai Farmers Research Center
estimated earlier this month.
	   In one of the cases where police made a arrest, the amount of
money being bet each night reached 7 million baht (dlrs 167,000).
	   On Wednesday, police arrested an insurance broker on charges of
serving as a bookie for betting on the games.
	   Khajornsak Pichaphan, 27, was arrested when police raided his
house in Bangkok.
	   Police said they found notebooks with accounts for 10 customers.
Khajornsak allegedly confessed that he had been a bookie for four
years, taking in more than 3 million baht (dlrs 71,000) a year.

Navy raises sunken North Korean sub conform

Eds: UPDATES with submarine raised, being towed to shore; trims to

By SANG-HUN CHOE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ A sunken North Korean submarine was
raised Thursday and towed to shore, where South Korean commandos
stood by to storm it with guns and tear gas.
	   The sub's crew was believed to be dead, but officials were
taking no chances.
	   Racing against an approaching storm, navy divers succeeded in
attaching four car-size air bags to the submarine as it lay 30
meters (110 feet) underwater. By pumping air into the yellow bags,
they raised the submarine, which was taken in tow by a tug boat.
	   ``We will tie the submarine to a barge and then soldiers will
first take a look inside and around the submarine,'' said Maj. Kim
Jong-woo, a Defense Ministry spokesman.
	   ``We believe that the North Korean crewmen have already died.
But we have to prepare against other possibilities. We have a
special team ready for that,'' said navy Capt. Park In-yong.
	   The North Korean submarine, already listing badly, sank Tuesday
while being towed to this major naval base on the east coast after
becoming entangled in South Korean fishing nets.
	   Rapid currents and high seas delayed the salvage operation.
	   Having detected no signs of life, military officials thought the
submarine's crew was either dead or had escaped before the ship was
captured Monday.
	   Used primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct surveillance, the
small, 70-ton Yugo-class submarine normally carries a crew of about
six.
	   In Seoul, President Kim Dae-jung reaffirmed that his policy of
engagement toward the communist North would not be swayed by the
discovery of the submarine.
	   ``As shown in the intrusion of our territorial waters by the
North Korean sub, military tensions persist even now on the Korean
Peninsula,'' Kim said in a speech marking the 45th anniversary
Thursday of the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950.
	   ``But the new government will continue to strive to safeguard
peace and expand South-North exchanges and cooperation on the basis
of a firm defense posture and a flexible policy toward the North,''
he said.
	   The sub's intrusion was a serious test of the so-called
``sunshine policy'' of the Kim's government, which was inaugurated
in February with a pledge to open up the reclusive North through
expanded civilian contacts and cooperation.
	   Opposition politicians and some newspaper editorials have
criticized Kim for not taking a harder line with North Korea
following the sub's discovery.
	   The sub was found in the general area where another, larger
North Korean sub ran aground two years ago. The 1996 incursion
triggered a 53-day manhunt that left 24 North Korean infiltrators
and 13 South Koreans dead and relations between the two Koreas at
their worst in years.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Court annuls 1994 Air France state aid decision 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) - A court on Thursday voided a 1994 decision by
the European Union executive commission to allow the French
government to pour 20 billion French francs (dlrs 3.3 billion
dollars) into the beleaguered state-owned company Air France.
	   The European Court of First Instance ruled in favor of rival
airlines who argued the aid violated EU competition rules. The
airlines were British Airways, British Midlands Airways, Dutch flag
carrier KLM and SAS, which is jointly owned by the governments of
Norway, Sweden and Denmark.
	   The court said the commission has two months to appeal the
decision. If it does, the case will go to the higher European Court
of Justice, also based in Luxembourg.
	   The commission said it had authorized the aid because it hoped
the money would help develop European air transport. The EU
executive body is due to issue a statement later Thursday on the
decision.
	   The commission is empowered to approve or block cases of state
aid in the 15-nation EU on the basis of whether they violate the
EU's competition rules.

French intelligence braces for nasty turn in World Cup violence 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Lens mayor's statement
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities on Thursday were stepping up
security around two high-risk World Cup matches involving Germany
and England that could spark new violence, possibly between
hooligans from the two countries.
	   Thursday's Germany-Iran match in the southern city of
Montpellier was under tightened security after German toughs beat a
policeman into a coma outside a match in the northern city of Lens
four days earlier.
	   Lens imposed a strict alcohol ban and was deploying hundreds
more police ahead of the England-Colombia match Friday, where some
authorities feared the violence could widen to German-English
clashes.
	   The newspaper Le Monde, in its Thursday edition, cited an
intelligence memo as saying that German extremists plan to travel
to Lens ``to combat the English enemy and try to gain the title of
`best hooligans of Europe.'''
	   The interior ministry had no immediate comment on the newspaper
report, and Lens Mayor Andre Delelis said in a statement released
Thursday that security ``should be more efficient than it was last
Sunday.''
	   A Lens spokeswoman, Isabelle Isaert, insisted ``the kids got the
message'' when officials jailed several Germans after Sunday's
rioting and quickly sentenced three of them to a year in prison.
	   But a ministry source privately confirmed the hundreds of police
to be deployed for the match were alerted about the possibility of
German-English clashes.
	   German police have also privately said they were taking the
development seriously. They stepped up checks of France-bound
motorists by boosting their border force from about 200 to more
than 1,000 ahead of the matches Thursday and Friday.
	   Violence has shaken and tainted the five-week soccer
championship, with clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100
injured, a policeman in a coma and an English fan in critical
condition.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have cracked down, arresting more than 250 people and deporting a
number of English and German rowdies.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
on Wednesday announced its first alcohol restrictions for Friday's
match. Officials banned its sale or possession on the streets from
8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As in other matches,
thousands of fans were coming without tickets _ at least 10,000
English on Friday _ raising concerns of more drunken unrest.
	   Most of the dozen German police working in France as
hooligan-spotters were being deployed in Lens, German police said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The police are among 180 officers from the 32 nations in the
World Cup, with the largest contingent of 25 from England helping
look for fans with a track record of violence, Le Monde said.
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths after clashes with English fans in Marseille
two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen local youths carrying
baseball bats.
	   An English fan was attacked, and remained in intensive care on
Wednesday. The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge,
West Midlands, was ``more reassuring'' Wednesday, a hospital
statement said.

Cambodian election campaign begins; stacked result feared 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Despite fears that the result is
stacked in favor of strongman Hun Sen, the campaign for Cambodia's
elections officially opened Thursday with thousands of people
welcoming the main candidates in separate rallies.
	   The polls July 26 will be Cambodia's first since 1993, when U.N.
peacekeeping troops were part of a dlrs 2 billion effort to usher
in a new era of peace and democracy after the Khmer Rouge genocide
of the late 1970s, followed by Vietnamese occupation.
	   This time, international assistance will be limited to technical
know-how and observers. Hun Sen _ who toppled the co-premier he had
ruled with since 1993, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup
last year _ holds most of the cards.
	   Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC party finished first five years
ago, but Hun Sen, who ruled with Vietnam's backing during the
1980s, forced his way into a coalition by threatening renewed civil
war.
	   Ranariddh, allowed to return to contest the current polls thanks
to diplomatic pressure on Hun Sen, told supporters that if he wins
this time, he will not share power _ which could set up another
showdown.
	   ``In 1993, FUNCINPEC won a big victory and I hope it will get an
even wider victory in 1998,'' Ranariddh said. ``If FUNCINPEC wins,
I will be the only prime minister.''
	   Ranariddh drew at least 10,000 supporters Thursday, with people
arriving by truck, car and boat in the eastern city of Kompong
Cham, where he launched his campaign. Motorcyclists held up party
banners and supporters cheered, ``Vote for FUNCINPEC and peace,
democracy and human rights will prevail!''
	   Hun Sen, seen as the front-runner because he controls the
security forces, the media and the bodies overseeing the polls,
drew some 6,000 people in Phnom Penh. He did not speak and Chea
Sim, president of their Cambodian People's Party, addressed the
crowd.
	   The CPP has accused the Khmer Rouge, which caused the deaths of
as many as 2 million Cambodians between 1975 and 1979, of trying to
use Ranariddh to return to power last year and maintains that the
coup stopped them.
	   The revolutionary group's last main base was overrun in March
and the notorious leader, Pol Pot, died of a purported heart attack
April 15. Other leaders and die-hard rebels are still on the run
near the border with Thailand.
	   ``The CPP will absolutely not allow the genocidal regime to
return to power and is committed to capturing and arresting the
hard-line leaders of the genocidal regime and to bring them to
trial,'' Chea Sim said.
	   Prominent dissident Sam Rainsy, meanwhile, told about 2,000 of
his supporters at Phnom Penh's main stadium that his party stood
for fighting corruption and improving the lives of the poor.
	   Sam Rainsy and Ranariddh have both threatened to pull out of the
election unless their concerns that it won't be free and fair are
addressed.
	   Hun Sen, who until now had denied the opposition access to the
all-important broadcast media, will begin allowing competing
parties five-minute slots per day on television and radio.
	   A total of 39 parties are competing for 120 seats in the
National Assembly. In registration concluded last week, 97 percent
of the 6.4 million eligible voters signed up, according to European
Union observers.
	   The opposition and human rights and election watchdog groups
have accused the CPP of carrying out killings and intimidation, but
the international community has said the process seems free and
fair enough to go forward.

French intelligence braces for nasty turn in World Cup violence 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Lens mayor's statement; also moved on news lines
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities on Thursday were stepping up
security around two high-risk World Cup matches involving Germany
and England that could spark new violence, possibly between
hooligans from the two countries.
	   Thursday's Germany-Iran match in the southern city of
Montpellier was under tightened security after German toughs beat a
policeman into a coma outside a match in the northern city of Lens
four days earlier.
	   Lens imposed a strict alcohol ban and was deploying hundreds
more police ahead of the England-Colombia match Friday, where some
authorities feared the violence could widen to German-English
clashes.
	   The newspaper Le Monde, in its Thursday edition, cited an
intelligence memo as saying that German extremists plan to travel
to Lens ``to combat the English enemy and try to gain the title of
`best hooligans of Europe.'''
	   The interior ministry had no immediate comment on the newspaper
report, and Lens Mayor Andre Delelis said in a statement released
Thursday that security ``should be more efficient than it was last
Sunday.''
	   A Lens spokeswoman, Isabelle Isaert, insisted ``the kids got the
message'' when officials jailed several Germans after Sunday's
rioting and quickly sentenced three of them to a year in prison.
	   But a ministry source privately confirmed the hundreds of police
to be deployed for the match were alerted about the possibility of
German-English clashes.
	   German police have also privately said they were taking the
development seriously. They stepped up checks of France-bound
motorists by boosting their border force from about 200 to more
than 1,000 ahead of the matches Thursday and Friday.
	   Violence has shaken and tainted the five-week soccer
championship, with clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100
injured, a policeman in a coma and an English fan in critical
condition.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have cracked down, arresting more than 250 people and deporting a
number of English and German rowdies.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
on Wednesday announced its first alcohol restrictions for Friday's
match. Officials banned its sale or possession on the streets from
8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As in other matches,
thousands of fans were coming without tickets _ at least 10,000
English on Friday _ raising concerns of more drunken unrest.
	   Most of the dozen German police working in France as
hooligan-spotters were being deployed in Lens, German police said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The police are among 180 officers from the 32 nations in the
World Cup, with the largest contingent of 25 from England helping
look for fans with a track record of violence, Le Monde said.
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths after clashes with English fans in Marseille
two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen local youths carrying
baseball bats.
	   An English fan was attacked, and remained in intensive care on
Wednesday. The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge,
West Midlands, was ``more reassuring'' Wednesday, a hospital
statement said.

Chirac launches new Africa policy with trip to southern Africa 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITTING Namibia-France to change slugline
AP Photos Planned
By PAT REBER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac set
foot for the first time in southern Africa on Thursday,
establishing a new economic and political beachhead that is key to
France's new African policy.
	   President Sam Nujoma, 69, greeted Chirac who landed just as the
winter sun got high enough to burn off the morning chill.
	   ``You see those mountains, they are full of uranium, copper and
oil. We need the French geologist to help develop them,'' Nujoma
told journalists shortly before Chirac's plane touched down.
	   Chirac is making a one-day visit to this capital, 360 kilometers
(223 miles) inland from the continent's southwest Atlantic
coastline.
	   With his arrival amidst the wheat colored mountains and thorn
acacia plains surrounding the capital city, Chirac began a six-day
trip that will also take him to South Africa, Mozambique and
Angola.
	   The tour comes less than a year after France launched major
changes in its Africa policies away from involvement in her former
West African colonies.
	   Close relations with post-apartheid South Africa, the dominant
nation of the region, play a central role in the new orientation.
	   Commercial and economic interests appear to dominate the move,
but France also wants to hedge increasing U.S. influence in Africa.
	   France has been criticized for propping up dictators in
countries like the former Zaire and Rwanda, and the new policy
calls for reducing the number of French troops and helping instead
to train African peacekeeping forces.
	   Like U.S. President Bill Clinton when he visited Africa earlier
this year, Chirac is traveling with top business people to explore
investment and trade opportunities.
	   ``France wants to offer these countries an opportunity to extend
their horizon,'' said presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna at
a Paris briefing before the trip.
	   Chirac's stops in Namibia, Angola and Mozambique are the first
visits ever by a French president. The late President Francois
Mitterand visited South Africa soon after Nelson Mandela was
elected president in 1994.
	   Later Thursday Chirac is to confer with Nujoma, elected in
Namibia's first democratic elections in 1989. Before that, Nujoma
was in exile for 30 years when South Africa ruled the territory
that is larger than Texas and Louisiana combined (or two-thirds the
size of South Africa).
	   Also on the one-day Namibian itinerary is a visit to a school in
Katutura, a black township where 30,000 Namibians were forced to
live after being uprooted from their homes in 1958 under apartheid
rule.
	   Namibia was hailed as a model of democracy when it broke away
from South Africa. But now the semi-arid country of 1.6 million
people is edging toward one-party rule by the South West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO) that waged the bush war against South
Africa.
	   Economic growth has fallen from 7.6 percent in 1992 to 2.6
percent in 1996 in this diamond and mineral-rich country.

Russian parliament delays consideration of emergency economic measures 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's opposition-dominated parliament decided
Thursday to delay consideration of a package of emergency economic
measures until next week despite Kremlin pressure for speedy
approval.
	   The measures are needed to put into action a new budget-cutting,
revenue-raising plan designed to win new lending from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Russia's financial markets have been falling for weeks, with
investors worried over the Asian crisis, plummeting oil prices and
the possibility of social unrest in Russia.
	   The fund is to decide later Thursday whether to release a
delayed dlrs 670 installment of an existing loan. A decision on
Russia's request for a new dlrs 10-15 billion loan is expected to
take several weeks.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko submitted the austerity plan to the IMF
on Wednesday, and sent a package of proposed legislation to
parliament's lower house, asking them to pass the bills as rapidly
as possible.
	   But the chamber, the State Duma, scheduled debate for July 1,
saying they need time to review the proposals. The date is just two
days before the Duma recesses for the summer.
	   The Duma is dominated by a coalition of Communists and
hard-liners who oppose President Boris Yeltsin and his economic
policies.
	   The Duma took up debate Thursday on a long-standing issue of
contention between parliament and the Kremlin: privatization of
state assets.
	   Communist leaders have frequently denounced the government's
previous privatization efforts, saying they sold off the state's
most valuable industries for fire-sale prices.

Italian unemployment rises to 12.5 percent in April 1998 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's unemployment stood at 12.5 percent in April,
up from 12.2 percent in January, according to quarterly figures
released Thursday by the state statistics institute.
	   ISTAT said the number of people looking for work was 2.882
million, a rise of 0.2 percent from April 1997.
	   The data also underlined the widening divide between the
country's more industrialized north and its less developed south.
	   In the north, unemployment fell to 6.6 percent in April 1998
from the 6.7 percent registered during the same period last year.
	   Central Italy's rate also dropped from 10.7 percent to 10
percent, whereas southern Italy registered an increase in the
jobless rate, going from 22.5 percent in April of last year to 23.1
percent this year.

Police detain dissident in Xi'an: Clinton's first stop in China Zhao letter, edits to trim, conform 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with another dissident arrested, more details from
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have detained two dissidents at the first
stop on President Clinton's China itinerary, a human rights group
said. Police surveillance of other democracy activists remained
tight Thursday.
	   Yan Jun, who joined in a letter signed by 70 people asking
Clinton to meet dissidents, was taken away from his home in Xi'an
Wednesday, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   Yan's whereabouts were unknown Thursday, the day of Clinton's
planned arrival in the north China city, the Hong Kong-based group
added.
	   Also detained Wednesday was Li Zhiying, a county official in
Chengcheng, about 125 kilometers (80 miles) northeast of Xi'an, who
was in frequent contact with other Xi'an dissidents and had
previously signed petitions to the government, the group said.
	   Letters and petitions are among the few recourses for Chinese
who take issue with government policy. Even former Communist Party
leader Zhao Ziyang, under house arrest since the June 3-4, 1989,
crackdown on democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square, has
resorted to penning his grievances.
	   The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported Wednesday that
Zhao wrote a letter to party leaders urging them to use the
occasion of Clinton's visit to reconsider their condemnation of the
Tiananmen protests as ``counterrevolutionary turmoil.''
	   ``The shadow of the June 4 Tiananmen incident should be cast
off. We should face the new century under the light of democracy,''
the newspaper quoted Zhao's letter as saying.
	   One Chinese source with contacts to Zhao's family said he
believed the letter was written with Zhao's knowledge, if not by
Zhao himself. Zhao is not allowed contact with the media, and
former associates of his reached by phone said that while they had
not seen any letter, its message was in keeping with Zhao's point
of view.
	   ``I certainly believe it represents Zhao's point of view,'' said
former aide Bao Tong, who spent seven years in prison for his
association with the liberal leader. ``The whole world can
understand his point of view.''
	   Clinton was due to arrive in Xi'an Thursday evening, kicking off
his nine-day visit, the first by a U.S. president since the
Tiananmen crackdown.
	   In a radio interview before his departure Wednesday, Clinton
said he wanted his trip to be a springboard for the causes of
democracy and freedom in China's closed society.
	   Meanwhile, police informed the wife of another dissident taken
from his home Wednesday that he was being held in the southern city
of Guilin, one of five cities on Clinton's itinerary.
	   Jiang Hangxia said police told her that her husband, Li
Xiaolong, would be freed and allowed to return home in three days
``if there were no problems.''
	   But police refused to say why he had been detained, she said. Li
had previously been on the run from police for fear of arrest for
pro-democracy activities but slipped home Tuesday night to see his
two children.
	   Meanwhile, veteran Beijing activist Xu Wenli said police on a
motorbike and in a car followed him Thursday when he took his wife
out for a homecoming dinner following her two-month trip to the
United States to visit their daughter.
	   Four of Xu's friends who tried to visit him Tuesday also were
detained, questioned and then released, he said.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center said that apart from
raising human rights in his summit Saturday with President Jiang
Zemin, Clinton also should pressure local leaders on his tour of
China for releases of political prisoners.
	   It cited two cases in Shaanxi, the first province on Clinton's
itinerary. One was a democracy activist detained in March after he
tried to run for local office. The other was a teacher serving a
five-year prison sentence for co-writing an article with Wang Dan,
one of China's most famous dissidents now in exile in the United
States.

Iraqi newspapers denounce U.N. decision to prolong sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations should lift sanctions
immediately because Iraq has no more illegal weapons to declare, an
official Iraqi newspaper said Thursday.
	   The latest row over VX nerve gas ``is aimed at maintaining the
status quo ... This is not possible and no one is ready to accept
it,'' the ruling Baath Party newspaper al-Thawra said in a
commentary.
	   ``Regarding further documents (on weapons), Iraq cannot provide
what it does not have,'' the newspaper said. ``Iraq shall not yield
to this oppression.''
	   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday agreed to extend the
sanctions for another two months after chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler reported that a U.S. Army laboratory had found
traces of deadly VX nerve gas in Iraqi missile warheads.
	   Also Wednesday, Iraq warned it will take action against the U.N.
inspectors if the sanctions, imposed for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, were not lifted immediately.
	   State-controlled newspapers on Thursday republished a statement
issued by Iraqi leaders on May 1, warning the Security Council of
unspecified ``grave consequences'' if the embargo is not lifted.
	   Iraq said the U.S. tests were incorrect and a fabrication. The
government said that its scientists experimented with VX but were
never able to produce weapons-grade material, and the gas was
certainly never mounted on weapons.
	   ``I am surprised. We know very well VX was never weaponized. We
know this. We have done this ourselves ... Now how did the VX
appear there (on missile warheads,) we have no idea,'' Lt. Gen.
Amer al-Saadi, a presidential adviser and father of Iraq's chemical
warfare program, told reporters late Wednesday.
	   Al-Saadi said he could not believe the test results, but
declined to comment on whether Baghdad thought the outcome was
tampered with by U.S. scientists.
	   He welcomed a decision by Butler to ask laboratories in France
and Switzerland to confirm the findings made by U.S. Army
scientists.
	   If the tests are conducted ``in a proper and a secure way,''
they will prove Iraq's claim, al-Saadi said.
	   Asked what Iraq would do if the French and Swiss tests uphold
the U.S. results, al-Saadi said: ``We are going to talk about it
again.''
	   He said the U.N. Special Commission overseeing the elimination
of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction has become ``an adversary''
and the VX issue is bound to damage confidence between the two
sides.
	   The U.S. lab was testing missile warhead fragments recovered by
U.N. inspectors from a dump site where the Iraqis had disposed of
their illegal weapons under the terms of a cease-fire agreement
that ended the 1991 Gulf War that ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
	   Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of its weapons of
mass destruction, the Security Council will not lift the sanctions.

Union and stevedore sign agreement ending waterfront dispute 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Ship loading company Patrick and the
dock workers' union signed a deal Thursday that the company said
will restore industrial peace at its ports around Australia.
	   The signing officially puts an end to a months-long battle for
control of the Australian waterfront that pitted the union against
Patrick and the federal government.
	   The Maritime Union of Australia said the deal would hold only if
legal action against the union by the government's fair-trade
watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, is
dropped.
	   ``We can sign the document theoretically at any time but nothing
will be implemented unless all the legal issues have been resolved.
That's a condition of the agreement,'' union spokesman Mick O'Leary
said.
	   A second condition is that the union drop a case alleging that
Patrick and the federal government conspired to end the union's
monopoly on waterfront hiring.
	   A majority of union members in state branches have now voted in
favor of the agreement.
	   Patrick Stevedores Holding Ltd. triggered the industrial battle
in April by firing all 1,400 in its unionized work force, locking
them out using guards and attack dogs and replacing them with
non-union labor.
	   Strikes, blockades and court challenges followed, finally ending
when the High Court ruled that the firings were illegal and ordered
that the workers be rehired, subject to commercial considerations.
	   Those considerations have meant the union has had to agree to
400 fewer unionized dock workers returning to Patrick docks.
	   Patrick chairman Chris Corrigan said Thursday's agreement will
deliver reforms sought by the company for years.

PARIS: Group G match. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   El-Selmi, who takes over for Kasperczak, declined to elaborate
on the shakeup.
	   Sources close to the team said that differences in opinion over
strategy during the England-Tunisia game, which England won 2-0,
could be a major reason behind the sacking of a coach who led
Tunisia to victory in five of its six World Cup qualifying matches.
	   Kasperczak instructed his team to use a defensive strategy.
Several players questioned his tactics, favoring an attacking game,
the sources said.
	   Kasperczak has coached Tunisia for the last 3 1-2 years. Before
that, he led Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) to third place in the 1994
African Nations Cup,
	   The Freiburg duo of Zoubeir Beya and Mehdi Ben Slimane, and Adel
Sellimi of Spain's Jaen _ three players who saw little action
against England because of Kasperczak's instructions _ are
understood to have objected to the cautious strategy against
England.
	   However, the three players denied that there was any such
difference of opinion, and officials at the Tunisian Football
Federation were not available to comment.
	   After the Tunisia-Colombia match Monday, team captain Sami
Trabelsi blasted the team's performance, signalling a potential
rift in the ranks of a team.
	   ``It's a shame that the whole team has to pay the price for the
difference in (the abilities) of the offense and defense,'' said
Trabelsi, referring to the offensive line's inability to complete
its frequent drives to the Colombian goal.
	   Kasperczak said the team would need to modify its style against
Romania. But his changed strategy came too late. Romania's
startling 2-1 win over England meant Tunisia could not qualify for
the second round.

Trial opens in southern Russian rail station attack 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two women went on trial Thursday on charges of
planting a bomb that destroyed a train station in southern Russia
last year, killing two people, a news agency reported.
	   The women, Fatima Taimaskhanova and Aiset Dadasheva, have
confessed to bombing the Pyatigorsk railway station in April 1997,
authorities have said. Two people were killed and more than 20
injured in the attack.
	   Prosecutors have charged Taimaskhanova and Dadasheva with
terrorism, premeditated murder and illegal possession and
transportation of explosives, the Interfax agency reported.
	   The two women are believed to be from Russia's separatist region
of Chechnya. Prosecutors are also preparing charges against a
renegade Chechen field commander, Salman Raduyev, who had
threatened attacks on Russian targets and is suspected of planning
the bombing, Interfax said.
	   Pyatigorsk, in Russia's troubled northern Caucasus region, is
about 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) south of Moscow and about 225
kilometers (140 miles) west of Chechnya's capital of Grozny.

Tokyo stocks edge higher, dollar rises 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond prices, other details
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices edged higher Thursday as
investors continued to await progress in the government's efforts
to revive the nation's economy. The U.S. dollar rose against the
yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 9.04 points, or 0.06
percent, closing at 15,132.22. On Wednesday, the index had climbed
68.58 points, or 0.46 percent.
	   Gains by high-technology issues, including Sony and TDK, and the
dollar's advance against the yen nudged the Nikkei index into
positive territory, traders said. An overnight rise on Wall Street
also encouraged buying in Tokyo.
	   But trading remained sparse as shares of the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan dropped, rekindling concerns about Japan's banking
industry.
	   LTCB shares fell to their par value of 50 yen during the morning
before recovering slightly and closing at 58 yen, down 12 yen from
Wednesday's close.
	   The LTCB, one of Japan's three credit banks, has become the
focus of concern recently among investors as Japan's banks struggle
to write off a mountain of soured loans, left from the collapse in
early 1990s of the highly speculative ``bubble economy.''
	   At the bank's annual shareholders' meeting Thursday, LTCB
President Katsunobu Onogi said the bank was considering a merger
but refused to name any potential partners.
	   Japanese banks are burdened with a total of 76 trillion yen
(dlrs 555 billion) in bad loans, making them wary of extending new
credit and hampering the economy's recovery.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto hopes a proposed ``bridge
bank'' will follow a U.S. formula under which collapsed financial
institutions are placed under government control, the Nihon Keizai
business daily said Thursday.
	   Hashimoto plans to have a final draft of concrete steps for
disposing of bad debts, centering on introduction of a bridge bank,
by July 2, the report said.
	   Among gainers were technology shares, which drew investors'
interest in line with overnight gains of similar issues on Wall
Street.
	   An estimated 422 million shares changed hands on the first
section, up from Wednesday's 373 million. Advances outnumbered
retreats 620 to 453, with 179 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.60 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,185.53. It
had gained 5.51 points, or 0.47 percent, the previous day.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 140.92 yen, up 0.56 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
141.25 yen overnight. It ranged between 140.61 yen and 141.70 yen
in Thursday's trading.
	   The dollar was lifted by a Japanese newspaper's reported that
the Chinese government was seriously considering devaluing its
currency, the yuan, if the dollar rises to 160 yen, dealers said.
	   The Tokyo Shimbun, quoting unidentified Chinese sources in
Beijing, said the yuan could be one of the topics discussed in U.S.
President Bill Clinton's summit in Beijing on Saturday.
	   ``If China won't devalue until 160 yen, traders can continue
buying dollars,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa
Bank.
	   Last week, Japan and the United States jointly sold dollars and
bought yen to bring the dollar down after it had reaching an
eight-year high of 146 against the Japanese currency.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.220 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.205 percent, driving its price down to 111.81 yen from 111.93
yen.

Rockets slam into airport while U.N. plane on tarmac 
</HEADLINE>
By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Three rockets slammed into the airport
in Afghanistan's war-shattered capital Thursday while passengers
were preparing to board a U.N. plane parked on the tarmac,
witnesses said.
	   There were no reports of injuries in the first attack on the
airport in two weeks.
	   One rocket landed 100 yards (meters) from the civilian terminal,
where people were gathered for the U.N. flight to neighboring
Pakistan, U.N. officials said on condition of anonymity.
	   The other two rockets landed on the western edge of the airport
compound where military aircraft are located, they said.
	   People on the road leading to the airport scurried for cover.
Shops quickly closed and dozens of people sought shelter.
	   The rockets reportedly came from north of the capital, where
opposition soldiers are fighting Taliban troops. Thursday's attack
followed heavy fighting in the Tagab area Wednesday, 35 miles (55
kilometers) northeast of Kabul.
	   The Taliban said it repulsed a powerful assault by opposition
forces in that area. They reported heavy casualties on the
opposition side, but that could not be confirmed.
	   The Taliban, which has imposed a strict form of Islamic rule in
the 85 percent of Afghanistan it controls, is battling an alliance
of several smaller groups on three separate battlefields, all north
of the city.
	   Opposition leaders contacted by satellite telephone also
reported heavy fighting in northern Kunduz province on the border
with Tajikistan, an area controlled by the Taliban.
	   Shortly before dawn Thursday, the opposition launched a
two-pronged attack at Bangi and Qala-e-Zal in Kunduz province, said
Samsulhaq Arinasfar, a spokesman for the anti-Taliban alliance.
	   Arinasfar did not have any casualty figures.
	   By controlling Kunduz and part of neighboring Baghlan province,
the Taliban can threaten opposition strongholds in nearby Takhar
province. Opposition forces also have a difficult time resupplying
their soldiers because they are cut off from the Panjshir Valley,
headquarters of former military chief Ahmed Shah Massood.

An overnight summary of Caribbean news PUERTO RICO: Governor finalizes sale of telephone company despite sabotage 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Gov. Pedro Rossello signed a law
privatizing the telephone company Wednesday, ignoring outraged
protesters who slashed telephone lines to a quarter of the island's
customers.
	   The dlrs 1.9 billion deal hands 50 percent plus one share of the
Puerto Rico Telephone Co.'s stock to a consortium led by U.S.
communications giant GTE Corp. and Popular Inc., a local bank.
	   The Federal Communications Commission must now approve the sale,
a process that could take months.
	   Rossello lost no time, signing the bill the day after it was
approved by the House of Representatives. The Senate approved the
sale last week, when the telephone company's 6,400 workers began an
indefinite strike.
	   Sabotage left 345,000 of the 1.3 million subscribers without
service, shut down a quarter of the company's cellular telephone
antennas and disabled 335 of the island's 750 automatic bank
machines.
 &UR; GUYANA: Protesters firebomb labor ministry
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Police braced for more violent
demonstrations against President Janet Jagan on Wednesday as they
continued to investigate the firebombing of Guyana's Labor
Ministry.
	   Police said security guards heard the bomb crash through a
first-story window Tuesday night, then spotted four men running
away as the flames spread. No one was hurt, and firefighters
quickly put out the fire.
	   The building is in the same block as Jagan's offices.
	   Protesters, mostly blacks of African descent who support the
opposition People's National Congress, claim that Jagan's party
rigged Dec. 15 elections. Jagan's People's Progressive Party is
backed mainly by Guyanese of East Indian descent.
	   An audit of the election results sponsored by the Caribbean
Community trade group said the vote was fair.
 &UR; SURINAME: Thousands march to demand president's resignation
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Thousands of people marched through
Paramaribo Wednesday to protest Suriname's stagnant economy and
demand the resignation of President Jules Wijdenbosch.
	   Chanting ``we're not going home yet because Bosje (Wijdenbosch)
must go first,'' members of opposition political parties and labor
unions marched past the presidential office and parliament, then
stopped and sang the national anthem.
	   Universities who had planned to give final exams on Wednesday
were forced to postpone the tests because most teachers were
marching, and business slowed as employees left offices to join the
passing crowd.
	   Organizers and news reports estimated the crowd at about 25,000
people. Police said the march was peaceful.
	   Workers have criticized Wijdenbosch's plans to privatize
government-owned corporations, including the State Oil Co. and
Surland, a banana company.
 &UR; TRINIDAD: Government will hang killers, ignore court order
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Firing the latest salvo in a
Caribbean rebellion against international efforts to halt
executions, Trinidad announced it will ignore an inter-American
court order and hang convicted killers this month.
	   ``The hanging is going to be carried out and it's going to be
carried out in the month of June,'' a defiant Ralph Maharaj, the
country's attorney general, told reporters Tuesday.
	   Last week, the Inter-American Court on Human Rights ordered
Trinidad and Tobago not to hang five convicted murderers and
scheduled an Aug. 28 hearing for the appeals of Wenceslaus James,
Anthony Briggs, Anderson Noel, Anthony Garcia and Christopher
Bethel.
	   Maharaj said the time given to the court to hear the petitions
had run out, as is the time given by a British Privy Council ruling
that it is inhumane to execute prisoners who have been on death row
for more than five years.
 &UR; CUBA: Clinton receives rare praise from Fidel Castro
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton is winning praise
from an unusual source _ Cuban President Fidel Castro.
	   The Cuban leader said Tuesday the ``balance is positive'' on
Clinton's performance in office despite Clinton's support for the
Helms-Burton law, which imposes sanctions on companies that invest
in Cuba.
	   ``I think Clinton has learned something, he's intelligent and he
defends U.S. interests and those of the multinationals, but from a
perspective different from that of the extreme right in the United
States,'' Castro told reporters, in remarks reported by Cuba's
official Prensa Latina news agency.
	   Castro said Clinton, whom he described as a peaceful, moral man,
approved Helms-Burton because he was ``looking for votes, above all
among those of Cuban origin.''
 &UR; UNITED STATES: 75 Cubans found in South Florida, Bahamas
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Five groups of Cubans, 75 in all, turned up from
south Florida to the Bahamas, having left their homeland on rafts
and in smugglers' boats.
	   They included a woman found on Key Biscayne, seven men found on
Plantation Key, 29 rafters spotted near the Bahamas and rescued by
the U.S. Coast Guard, and 33 who appeared late Tuesday off Key
Biscayne.
	   ``The smugglers are dropping them off and taking off again,''
said U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Keith Roberts.
	   Two groups of the Cuban rafters were spotted near the Bahamas by
Brothers to the Rescue search pilots. Twenty Cubans _ including six
children, the youngest a year-old boy _ were spotted at Dog Rocks.
Nine Cubans were found at Elbow Key.
	   Brothers pilots called the U.S. Coast Guard, which sent two
cutters and an aircraft.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: City dedicates long-forgotten monument to Puerto
Rican
	   HARTFORD, Connecticut (AP) _ A monument to Puerto Rican baseball
great Roberto Clemente was dedicated in a city park Wednesday,
nearly three decades after it was commissioned and then never
claimed.
	   The 6-foot-tall (1.8-meter-tall) granite monument was discovered
last fall in a debris-strewn lot in Bridgeport, Connecticut by
police officers.
	   When Hartford Councilman Luis Ayala heard about the fate of the
monument, a duplicate of one erected in Bridgeport, he decided it
must be brought to the Connecticut capital.
	   ``I felt it was important that the first Puerto Rican ever to be
inducted into the Hall of Fame be honored in our city,'' Ayala told
the largely Latino crowd at Colt Park.
	   Clemente, who played right field for the Pittsburgh Pirates,
died when his chartered plane crashed on Dec. 31, 1972, while
carrying humanitarian aid to Nicaraguan earthquake victims.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Shares in one of Japan's largest banks plummeted
Thursday as executives spelled out a drastic restructuring plan and
hinted at a possible merger, adding to fears the institution may be
foundering.
	   Share prices in Long-Term Credit Bank dived to 50 yen _ equal to
face value _ within the first hour of trading Thursday, from 70 yen
on Wednesday.
	   LTCB's shares closed down 12 at 58 yen _ still a dangerously low
level that analysts believe, if continued, signals the bank may
have trouble obtaining further loans.
	   The Long-Term Credit Bank, the 22nd largest bank in the world,
according to Forbes magazine, has become the focus of concern among
investors as Japan's banks struggle to get out from under a
mountain of bad debt.
	   Bank officials have repeatedly denied rumors that the bank is on
the verge of failure, but they recently acknowledged it holds some
1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem loans.
	   At the bank's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, officials
detailed plans announced in February to shut down about half of its
overseas outlets and cut staff by 20 percent.
	   LTCB President Katsunobu Onogi told stockholders the bank was
considering a merger but refused to name any potential partners. He
denied reports the bank would merge with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ The Asian financial crisis is adding to the
already heavy burdens of China's overstrained state coffers, the
state-run newspaper China Daily reported Thursday.
	   Between January and May, state tax revenues grew by 7.7 percent,
while expenditures rose 12.8 percent, it quoted Finance Minister
Xiang Huaicheng as saying.
	   A drop in tax collections, sluggish consumer demand and poor
performances by state-run companies had caused a ``serious
financial situation,'' Xiang told the standing committee of the
national legislature.
	   ``The financial situation is full of comparatively severe
problems,'' Xiang was quoted as saying.
	   The crunch comes as the government is stepping up investment in
infrastructure and other areas to fight slackening demand caused by
the regional downturn.
	   A need to spend more on grain purchases, export promotion and
unemployment insurance and other social welfare is adding to state
burdens, the report said.
	   China recorded a financial deficit of 55.8 billion yuan (dlrs
6.7 billion) in 1997, it said.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will put two heavily
indebted car and steel companies up for international auction by
October, government officials said Thursday.
	   Officials at the Ministry of Finance and Economy said the
government plans to take bids for Kia Motors Co. in mid-July and
Hanbo Steel Co. in September.
	   Both Kia and Hanbo are under court receivership after going
bankrupt in 1997.
	   The move to sell both companies is the latest in the
government's efforts to restructure the nation's economy under the
terms of a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International Monetary
Fund.
	   Kia Motors, the nation's third largest car-maker, went bankrupt
almost a year ago under the weight of dlrs 1 billion in bank loans.
	   The government is Kia's largest stockholder, with a 30 percent
stake. U.S. car giant Ford holds 16.9 percent, with remaining
shares owned by thousands of small investors, including Kia
employees.
	   Ford is one of Kia's major takeover candidates. The other
candidates include Hyundai Motors Co. and Daewoo Motors Co., the
nation's leading car producers.
	   Hanbo is South Korea's second largest steel-maker. It collapsed
in January last year with dlrs 3.6 billion in bank loans
outstanding. No domestic investors could be found to take it over.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Threatened by the Asian crisis, Singapore's
vulnerable economy will enter its worst recession ever this year,
economists said Thursday.
	   Singapore's gross domestic product will contract by 1.7 percent
in 1998, according to economist Chen Kang of the Nanyang Technology
University. He said the recession will be the worst in Singapore's
33-year history.
	   During the small city state's last recession in 1985, gross
domestic product shrank by 1.6 percent.
	   Presenting his forecast to a conference held by the Forex
Association of Singapore, Chen said he sees GDP shrinking by 2.7
percent in the second quarter this year, 4.3 percent in the third
and 4.8 percent in the final quarter.
	   The prediction runs counter to government expectations, which
foresee Singapore's economy slowing substantially but avoiding
outright recession.
	   The government revealed earlier this week that it would revise
its optimistic forecast for growth of between 2.5 and 4.5 percent,
which was made in February before the full extent of the Asian
crisis was realized.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Asian Development Bank's board
approved Thursday a dlrs 1.5 billion loan to be used to strengthen
and reform Indonesia's financial sector.
	   Political turmoil in Indonesia caused the loan to be delayed
over the past month, but the International Monetary Fund's recent
agreement to release the next portion of its rescue package for
Indonesia in early July put the ADB loan back on track.
	   The loan will be dispersed in three portions, an ADB official
said.
	   The ADB expects to pay dlrs 550 million shortly after the loan's
approval, although no specific timetable was disclosed. This will
be followed by another dlrs 500 million at the end of the year,
with the balance to be dispersed in 1999.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian telecommunications company
Optus Communications Pty. Ltd. said Thursday it has entered into a
U.S. dlrs 150 million (250 million Australia dollar) five-year
outsourcing contract with U.S.-based information technology concern
Digital Equipment Corp., a unit of Compaq Computer.
	   Under the contract, Digital will manage Optus' two data centers,
network systems infrastructure, help desk, desktop and production
support.
	   ``Digital will be responsible for the efficient management and
future upgrades of the administration applications run from the
data centers, as well as Optus' internal network systems
infrastructure and services,'' the company said in a statement.

Indonesia and IMF sign new agreement over economic bailout IMF official, rupiah value unchanged after announcement

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Worried that deepening economic pain
could fuel fresh riots, Indonesia and the International Monetary
Fund on Thursday announced a revised bailout deal loaded with fuel
and food subsidies for millions of poor people.
	   The agreement opens the way for the resumption of a dlrs 43
billion IMF-led rescue package, badly needed to heal an economy
expected to shrink by more than 10 percent this year.
	   Hubert Neiss, the IMF's senior official in Asia, said even more
international aid might be needed to supplement the bailout.
	   Directors of the 182-nation lending agency are expected to
approve the disbursement of new loans to Indonesia at a meeting
next month at their Washington headquarters.
	   Aid was halted in May because of protests and deadly riots over
price increases in the nation of 200 million that led to the
downfall of President Suharto. Since then, investors have stayed on
the sidelines and the Indonesian rupiah has slid steadily.
	   ``We face a situation of emergency,'' Neiss said at a news
conference at the presidential palace.
	   ``Production and exports have been disrupted, unemployment is
increasing, banks are partially paralyzed, food prices are rising:
because of all that, it's no wonder the rupiah rate has further
depreciated,'' he said.
	   News of the agreement failed to inspire skeptical traders, and
the rupiah didn't budge in value after the announcement.
	   Under the latest plan, Indonesia has recommitted itself to
making good on previous promises for sweeping reforms, such as a
tightening of the shaky banking system, debt reduction and greater
financial and government transparency.
	   At the same time, the IMF has approved boosts to social welfare
to help cushion millions of poor hit hard by Indonesia's worst
turmoil in three decades.
	   More money will be spent on health, education and job creation.
As many as 1,200 people died in riots in the capital in May, many
fear more violence without such social expenditures.
	   ``The most urgent priority is to repair the distribution system
and ensure adequate supplies of food and other necessities to all
parts of the country,'' said Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's
top economic minister. He joined Neiss to announce the bailout
deal, which was signed Wednesday.
	   The agreement follows weeks of negotiations and is the fourth
struck by Indonesia and the IMF since October. Previous bailout
agreements were stymied when the authoritarian Suharto failed to
deliver on promises to the IMF to reform the economy.
	   Critics accused him of wanting to protect the vast business
empires of his super-rich children and friends, who had profited
from a web of subsidies, tax breaks and other benefits under
Suharto's patronage.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised to make
sweeping democratic reforms and cooperate fully with the IMF.
	   Under the new deal, a growing budget deficit, made necessary by
increased social welfare spending, would be largely covered by
international loans.
	   However, Ginandjar and Neiss made it clear that tough times
still lay ahead. They said Indonesia's economy would contract by at
least 10 percent and inflation would run to 80 percent this year.
	   They predicted the rupiah would trade at 10,000 rupiahs to the
dollar by the end of 1998, compared with about 14,800 rupiahs now
and 2,400 when the crisis started in July 1997.

Court annuls 1994 Air France state aid decision 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS details, Air France reaction
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) - A court on Thursday voided a 1994 decision by
the European Union executive Commission to allow the French
government to pour 20 billion French francs (dlrs 3.3 billion
dollars) into the state-owned company Air France.
	   The European Court of First Instance ruled in favor of rival
airlines who argued the aid violated EU competition rules. The
airlines who filed the complaint were British Airways, British
Midlands Airways, Dutch flag carrier KLM, and SAS, which is jointly
owned by the governments of Norway, Sweden and Denmark.
	   The court said it is up to the Commission to ``reconsider the
matter in order to adopt the measures which compliance with this
judgment dictates.''
	   The Commission has two months to appeal the decision. If it
does, the case will go to the higher European Court of Justice,
also based in Luxembourg.
	   The Commission said it had authorized the aid because it hoped
the money would help develop European air transport. The EU
executive body was due to issue a statement later Thursday on the
decision.
	   Air France said Thursday in Paris that the court's decision
would not affect the money given to the airline.
	   ``The decision is more over the form of the Commission's
decision than on the substance and in itself, doesn't call into
question'' the 20-billion-French-franc package, a spokeswoman for
Air France said.
	   The court said it found in favor of the plaintiffs in two
matters.
	   The rival airlines had protested against the use of some of the
funds by Air France to buy 17 new aircraft, saying it was
unjustified to approve aid for this purpose.
	   The court also backed the rival airlines' claim that the
Commission had failed to investigate the impact the aid would have
on air routes outside the European Union, and on smaller airline
companies operating long-haul routes from France.
	   Conditions set by the Commission when it approved the aid
included assurances that Air France would neither acquire new
aircraft, merge with its Air Inter unit nor open any new routes
within Europe for three years.
	   Furthermore, the airline was to restructure and return to
profitability by 1996.
	   The Commission is empowered to approve or block cases of state
aid in the 15-nation EU on the basis of whether they violate the
EU's competition rules.

Malaysia PM: New Cabinet finance post not political 
</HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sudden installation of his top
economic adviser in a Cabinet-level post was not a political shove
to his finance minister, Malaysia's prime minister said Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Wednesday appointed his close
confidant, Daim Zainuddin, to the new, vaguely worded post of
Special Functions Minister.
	   Mahathir insisted it was not intended as a slight against his
deputy, Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``There's no precedence between Daim and Anwar,'' Mahathir told
reporters, indicating that the health of the country's economy was
the priority. Daim's Cabinet position, Mahathir said, ``doesn't
imply that Anwar isn't doing a good job.''
	   When asked, however, if Daim's appointment was a sign of Anwar
losing power, Mahathir smiled and said: ``You have to ask Daim and
Anwar. I cannot answer that.''
	   Mahathir said Daim's new position was designed to bolster the
National Economic Action Council, a government task force headed by
Daim to examine the slump that saw the economy shrink by 1.8
percent in the first quarter of the year.
	   Analysts widely interpreted the move as a way to shift power
away from Anwar, whose policies have conflicted with Mahathir's
prescriptions for the economic slump.
	   ``I see it as an attack on Anwar,'' economist Neil Saker, SG
Asian Research, said after the announcement Wednesday. ``He's going
to be economic czar when it should be Anwar.''
	   Mahathir said Daim, a business-friendly former finance minister
credited with lifting the country from its last economic recession
in the 1980s, would retain the position until the economic turmoil
ended.
	   He stressed that Anwar would neither report to Daim nor would
the duties of the two men overlap.
	   The comments, however, are unlikely to ease concerns of a
growing political friction between Mahathir and Anwar.
	   Anwar has backed the central bank's program of tight monetary
policy, which resembled the strict measures prescribed by the
International Monetary Fund. Malaysia, unlike its more hard-hit
neighbors Indonesia and Thailand, has not had to resort to an IMF
bailout.
	   Anwar's rescue program included drastic government spending
cuts, tightening of bank loans and raising interest rates.
	   Mahathir, supported by Daim, has favored lower interest rates.
The two have insisted Malaysian businesses needed loans and
high-growth policies to survive the Asian financial crisis.
	   Mahathir said Thursday that Anwar's IMF-like policies had
crippled Malaysia's economy and caused damage beyond Malaysia's
control that had to be rectified.
	   ``Domestically, I'm in full control but unfortunately domestic
affairs are being managed from outside,'' he said.
	   ``Initially, we thought that IMF strategies were very good, so
we adopted them only to find that they damaged our economy,''
Mahathir said. ``Now, we're trying to figure out how to manage our
economy after the damage has been done.''
	   The ringgit has depreciated nearly 40 percent against the dollar
since last year, forcing the cost of overseas loans to skyrocket.
The higher interest rates have caused money to be moved out of
Malaysia, making it more difficult for banks to issue loans.
	   Lim Kit Siang, the opposition leader in Parliament, said Daim's
new post implies the government is still divided on how to restore
confidence in the economy.
	   ``Daim's appointment ... raises the question whether we are
nearing a situation where there would be two finance ministers in
the Cabinet,'' said Lim. ``This will send out distressing signals
to the market.''

World Cup: Coach fired for team's poor performance reported earlier this week 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: REPHRASES at top to show that Tunisia is confirming dismissal
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ The Tunisian soccer team made it official
Thursday: Henri Kasperczak is out as the national coach following
losses to England and Colombia that left the team with no chance to
advance in the World Cup.
	   The confirmation from team officials came one day before
Tunisia's final World Cup match against Romania in Group G. French
organizers of the tournament had reported Kasperczak's dismissal on
Tuesday, following the 1-0 loss to Colombia a day earlier.
	   Ali el-Selmi, the former assistant, confirmed Thursday that he
had been appointed the new head coach. But he declined to elaborate
on the shakeup.
	   Kasperczak, a Pole who had been coaching Tunisia for 3 1-2
years, was the third coach to be dismissed following disappointing
performances at this World Cup. Carlos Alberto Parreira, a
Brazilian, was ousted last week as coach of Saudi Arabia. Over the
weekend, South Korea fired Cha Bum-kun after his team also failed
to reach the second round.
	   Kasperczak's downfall was the result of differences over
strategy that emerged during the England-Tunisia game June 15,
which England won 2-0.
	   Kasperczak instructed his team to emphasize defensive tactics.
Several players questioned his plan and urged an attacking game,
team sources said.
	   Kasperczak had led Tunisia to victory in five of six World Cup
qualification matches. Before taking the Tunisian job in 1995, he
coached led Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) to third place in the 1994
African Nations Cup,
	   The Freiburg duo of Zoubeir Beya and Mehdi Ben Slimane, and Adel
Sellimi of Spain's Jaen _ three players who saw little action
against England because of Kasperczak's instructions _ are
understood to have objected to the cautious strategy against
England.
	   However, the three players denied that there was any such
difference of opinion.
	   After the Tunisia-Colombia match Monday, team captain Sami
Trabelsi blasted the team's performance, signalling a potential
rift in the ranks of a team.
	   ``It's a shame that the whole team has to pay the price for the
difference in (the abilities) of the offense and defense,'' said
Trabelsi, referring to the offensive line's inability to complete
its frequent drives to the Colombian goal.
	   Kasperczak said the team would need to modify its style against
Romania. But his changed strategy came too late. Romania's
startling 2-1 win over England meant Tunisia could not qualify for
the second round.

Two nomadic tribes discovered in New Guinea: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian officials say they have
discovered two nomadic tribes in the remote interior of western New
Guinea, a news report said Thursday.
	   The official Antara news agency said the tribes people
communicate with sign language.
	   It quoted Onesimus Ramandey, head of the provincial social
welfare office, as saying the Vahudate tribe, made up of 20
families, and the Aukedate tribe, consisting of 33 families, roam
areas near the Mamberamo River, near the center of the province.
	   The report did not say whether there was any evidence to suggest
that the groups had had contact with outsiders before.
	   Irian Jaya, about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) east of
Jakarta, was taken over by Indonesia in 1963.
	   Most of its 1.5 million people are Melanesian and many still
follow traditional village lifestyles.
	   Much of the province is jungle or rugged terrain. Some parts of
Irian Jaya were first visited by outsiders in the 1930s.

Argentina's president signs cooperation agreements with Yeltsin 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Argentina's Carlos Menem and Russia's Boris
Yeltsin discussed joint action Thursday to reduce illegal weapons
trafficking between the two countries, a news agency reported.
	   They agreed to ``coordinate their efforts towards cutting arms,
putting them under control, and slashing military expenditures,''
the Interfax news agency reported, citing a document signed by the
two leaders.
	   Menem's trip marks the first state visit of an Argentine
president to Russia.
	   Yeltsin was ebullient about the meeting. ``I like the Argentine
president, and I have with pleasure and without any obstacles done
business with him in the past and am ready to do more,'' he said,
according to Interfax.
	   Yeltsin plans to visit Argentina in 1999, Interfax said, citing
presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   The two leaders also signed agreements on protecting investments
and created a joint commission on general cooperation. They plan to
begin yearly consultations between their foreign ministers,
Interfax said.

Japanese theater cuts short showing of `Nanjing 1937' film 
</HEADLINE>
By KOZO MIZOGUCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fear of right-wing extremists has forced a movie
theater in western Japan to stop showing a film about Japanese
wartime atrocities in China during the 1930s, the theater said
Thursday.
	   The Cinesalon Paveria in Fukuoka, 900 kilometers (560 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, had planned to show the film ``Nanking 1937''
from June 20 until July 10, but will end the run on July 3 instead.
	   The movie, produced jointly by Hong Kong and Chinese
film-makers, takes place during the ``Rape of Nanking,'' the
Japanese Imperial Army's 1937 rampage through the city now known as
Nanjing. Up to 300,000 people _ including many civilians _ were
killed.
	   The theater in Fukuoka was not directly threatened by rightists,
who oppose any criticism of Japan's wartime conduct. But an
extremist slashed a screen at a theater showing the movie near
Tokyo in June, and right-wing protesters have harassed other
theaters.
	   Mitsunori Taniguchi, president of the theater's operator, TNC
Project Co., said he had hired two security guards to protect
viewers at the 100-seat theater against possible sabotage.
	   ``We can't take the pressure any more,'' Taniguchi said.
	   Taniguchi said the film depicts the suffering of a married
couple _ a Chinese doctor and a Japanese woman _ who live through
the Japanese invasion.
	   A group of Japanese movie directors issued a statement last
Wednesday against the rightists, many of whom contend that the
Nanking massacre was a hoax aimed at humiliating Japan.
	   Earlier this month, a group of right-wing academics accused Iris
Chang, the author of ``The Rape of Nanking,'' of exaggerating the
atrocities and twisting facts. Chang denied the allegations.
	   Depictions of Japan's wartime role are still contentious in
Asia.
	   China issued a vehement protest on May 9 over the release in
Japan of ``Pride,'' a movie about the trial and execution of
Japanese wartime leader Gen. Hideki Tojo for war crimes. The film
depicts Tojo as a hero.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Rookie golfer Pak Se-ri was given a
dlrs 290,000 bonus by her corporate sponsor Thursday for winning
the LPGA championship in Rockland, Delaware, in May.
	   The victory was worth dlrs 195,000.
	   Pak, 20, who is sponsored by South Korea's giant Samsung group,
became the first rookie whose first victory on tour was a major
tournament since Liselotte Neumann won the U.S. Open 10 years ago.
	   Kim Dong-seok, a Samsung spokesman, said worldwide television
coverage of Pak wearing clothing bearing the Samsung logo was worth
an estimated dlrs 150 million in free advertising.
	   Pak signed a 10-year contract with Samsung in 1996. It provided
for an initial payment of dlrs 570,000, an additional dlrs 72,000
each year and unspecified performance bonuses.

Governing party ready to hold presidential elections ahead of schedule 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan government said
Thursday it was ready to hold presidential elections two years
ahead of schedule, as the opposition insists.
	   ``If this is what the opposition wants, we can go ahead and hold
the elections any time after November,'' Constitutional Affairs
Minister Lakshman Peiris told reporters at the weekly Cabinet
briefing.
	   The leader of the opposition United National Party, Ranil
Wickremasinghe, had said that because the government was proposing
postponing local elections by six months, it should move up the
presidential elections which have been planned for the year 2000.
The government needs the UNP's support in Parliament if it wants to
defer local elections.
	   The government wants to postpone local elections scheduled for
August, saying it will not be able to provide proper security at a
time it is preoccupied with fighting Tamil separatists.
	   Militants among Sri Lanka's Tamil minority are fighting for an
independent homeland in the north and east of the country. The
armed forces are often backed by police, depleting their strength
for normal law enforcement duties.
	   ``The war is in a very critical stage and it will not be
possible to take men out and deploy them on election duty,'' Peiris
said.
	   ``This is not our decision,'' Peiris said about moving up the
presidential polls. ``At the same time we would like to emphasize
that if this is what the opposition wants to give their support to
postpone the local elections, we are ready to accept the
challenge.''
	   Wickremasinghe did not contest the last presidential race in
1994. In that election, President Chandrika Kumaratunga romped home
with 62 percent of the vote after the UNP's candidate, Gamini
Dissanayake, was assassinated allegedly by Tamil guerrillas.
Dissanayake's widow, Srima, ran in his place.

at 13.6 million tons, up 300,000 tons from the same period last
year, a government official said Thursday.
	   Quach Ngoc An, deputy director of the Agriculture Ministry's
Extensive Farming Department, said southern provinces produced 8.38
million tons in October-April, up 500,000 tons from the same period
last year. The northern provinces' output dropped by 200,000 tons
to 5.22 million tons due to hot weather.
	   An said the figures were based on reports from all 61 cities and
provinces.
	   Some areas in the Mekong Delta, the major rice-growing region,
and the central highlands were affected by the recent drought, the
worst in a century. But damage to the summer-autumn crop for
April-August is not large.
	   An said Vietnam is sticking to its target of 31 million tons of
food production for the year, with 4 million tons of rice exports.
	   Last year, Vietnam produced 30.6 million tons of food and
exported more than 3.5 million tons of rice, he said.

Report: town councilor killed by Basque separatists 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
<TEXT>
	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A governing party town councilor was
killed Wednesday by a bomb in an attack believed to be carried out
by the armed Basque separatist group ETA, national Spanish radio
reported.
	   Manuel Zamarreno of the Popular Party in this northern Basque
town died after a bomb exploded when it hit his car, the radio
said. According to the report, two other people in the car were
also injured in the attack that took place shortly after 11 a.m.
(0900GMT).
	   If the reports prove correct, Samareno will be the sixth victim
of ETA so far this year.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its campaign for an
independent Basque state in 1968.

Russia cuts oil production by 100,000 barrels a day 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will cut crude oil production by 100,000
barrels a day in an effort to help halt the worldwide fall in oil
prices, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The report said Energy Minister Sergei Generalov has agreed to
the cuts with his counterparts from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries during their meeting in Vienna.
	   ITAR-Tass did not give a figure for total oil production, or say
when the cuts would take place.
	   In March, the then-First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov
said the Russian government can't impose cuts on Russian oil
companies because they are mostly privately-owned. However, the
government controls the export pipelines.

Imelda Marcos postpones burial of Ferdinand Marcos in heroes' cemetery new 6th-9th grafs 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with reactions from Ramos, groups opposed to burial in
AP Photos Available
By OLIVER TEVES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former first lady Imelda Marcos
backed off Thursday from a plan to bury her husband, dictator
Ferdinand Marcos, in a heroes' cemetery because of widespread
opposition that threatened the popularity of the Philippines'
president-elect.
	   ``In the spirit of national interest, our family is prepared to
wait,'' Mrs. Marcos said in a statement. ``The burial of the late
President Marcos will be deferred to a more appropriate time.''
	   The emotion-charged dispute over whether Marcos should be buried
at Heroes' Cemetery in metropolitan Manila nearly nine years after
dying in exile in 1989 has reopened old wounds and divided
Filipinos.
	   The plan to bury Marcos on July 11 had been approved by
President-elect Joseph Estrada, a former Marcos supporter who takes
office June 30. Estrada told reporters Thursday he was surprised at
the extent of the opposition because he thought burying Marcos
would put the issue to rest.
	   Since Estrada announced his approval, widespread opposition had
eroded the massive popular support he received in last month's
elections.
	   Outgoing President Fidel Ramos expressed satisfaction at Mrs.
Marcos' decision, but hinted that Estrada may have made a rash
decision in allowing the burial.
	   He said there should have been initial dialogue to keep
``problems of this nature, which are really small to begin with,
from breaking into national concerns and crisis even.''
	   Other groups that opposed the burial said a postponement was
unacceptable.
	   ``The threat to make a hero out of a notorious tyrant and thief
still looms before us. There is no room for complacency,'' said
Marie Hilao, spokeswoman for the ``Marcos is No Hero'' movement.
	   Officials close to Estrada say they arranged for an intermediary
to visit Mrs. Marcos to ask her to delay the burial, although
Estrada claimed Thursday that he had not personally sent anyone to
talk to her.
	   Marcos' 20-year rule ended in a ``people power'' revolt in 1986.
After he died in Hawaii, his body was not allowed to return to the
Philippines until September 1993. Since then it has been kept in a
glass coffin in an air-conditioned mausoleum in his northern
hometown.
	   Both Ramos and his predecessor, Corazon Aquino, refused to let
Marcos' body be brought to Manila, fearing conflicts between the
former strongman's supporters and opponents.
	   Ramos ordered a halt Tuesday to construction of Marcos' grave at
the cemetery for the week remaining in his term.
	   In recent days there have been almost daily demonstrations
against the planned burial. On Tuesday, the ``Marcos is No Hero''
movement said that instead of reconciliation, the burial at the
cemetery, where many soldiers who died in battle are buried, would
cause new divisions.
	   Some relatives of soldiers buried in the cemetery said they
planned to transfer their dead elsewhere if Marcos' burial went
ahead. Other critics said they plan to seek a court injunction
against the burial, and Estrada said Thursday he will now wait for
a court ruling.
	   ``This time I will wait for the decision of the court,'' he
said.
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial at the cemetery is appropriate
because he was a veteran who fought during World War II.
	   The government accuses the late president and his associates of
illegally amassing billions of dollars during his 20-year rule.
Marcos' government also was accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents.

Greek president in Cyprus in show of solidarity 
</HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek President Constantinos
Stephanopoulos arrived in Cyprus Thursday on the first visit by a
Greek head of state to this war-divided Mediterranean island.
	   The visit is widely seen as a show of Greek solidarity with
Greek Cypriots at a time of increased saber-rattling between Cyprus
and Turkey, which backs a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state on the
island.
	   ``This is one of the most important moments in my life, This is
not a typical diplomatic visit but a visit of love, honor and
affection,'' Stephanopoulos said in an emotional arrival statement.
	   The Greek leader, whose red carpet welcome at Larnaca airport
was carried live on television and radio, was received by Greek
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and his entire Cabinet.
	   Stephanopoulos is a figurehead and his office is largely
ceremonial but his four-day visit has prompted Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel to begin a visit to the Turkish-Cypriot part of
Cyprus next week.
	   ``The presence in Cyprus of the Greek president sends an
important message, a message that says Greece is here to defend
Cyprus' democracy and justice and our efforts to join the European
family,'' Clerides said.
	   Turkey, a fellow NATO member of Greece and its traditional
rival, invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974. A
Turkish Cypriot state declared in the north in 1983 is recognized
only by Ankara and Clerides' government remains the only
internationally recognized administration on the island.
	   Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been living apart since the
invasion, with a U.N.-patrolled line running across the island
separating them. Repeated international efforts to reunite the
island have so far failed.
	   ``I'll visit all the areas of free Cyprus and take the love of
the Greek people to them,'' Stephanopoulos said.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Cyprus rose last week following the
visits by Turkish and Greek warplanes to the island nation in a
show of force.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus while Greece
and the Cypriot government are bound by a 1993 defense pact.
	   Greece, which has a decades-old dispute with Turkey over rights
in the Aegean sea, has repeatedly stated its intention to fight
alongside its Greek Cypriot allies if hostilities break out on the
island.
	   Such a possibility increased after Turkey threatened military
action to stop the planned deployment in October of Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles that the Clerides government has
purchased from Russia.

Trade Ministry introducing five measures to boost exports 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's Ministry of Trade is introducing
five measures to boost exports in an effort to meet the target set
by the National Assembly, the newspaper Investment reported
Thursday.
	   The Ministry of Trade says export volume was dlrs 4.76 billion
in the first half of 1998. While that is up 10.6 percent from the
same period last year, it was the lowest growth figure in six
years.
	   Vietnam would have to export dlrs 6.2 billion worth of goods the
rest of the year to meet the National Assembly's target.
	   The ministry said it wants to:
	   _Strengthen trade relations with fellow members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, especially in barter.
	   _Promote trade with China, expand markets in Russia and former
Soviet republics. Maintain export volume to Japan, which totaled
dlrs 1.7 billion last year, along with Europe and the United
States.
	   _Provide tax incentives for exporters and set up export support
funds.
	   _Revise regulations to simplify export procedures for
foreign-invested companies.
	   _Tighten control of imported consumer goods to within 20 percent
of the value of exports.

Kosovo Albanian leader cites ``ethnic cleansing'' in his province 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN MADER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Kosovo-Albanian political leader Ibrahim
Rugova intensified his appeal Thursday for NATO intervention in his
secessionist home province, saying that Serb-led forces were
driving out tens of thousands of his ethnic brethren.
	   Rugova, who met with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, recalled the
``ethnic cleansing'' of the war in Bosnia in his accounts of
Kosovo, located in the Serb Republic that makes up most of
Yugoslavia.
	   About 80,000 ethnic Albanians, the group that makes up 90
percent of Kosovo's population, have been driven from their homes
by fighting between Serb forces and the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army. About 15,000 people have fled to neighboring Albania. More
than 300 people have been killed.
	   ``We see ethnic cleansing taking place already in Kosovo,'' said
Rugova, who was to meet later Thursday with Chancellor Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. He then returns to Kosovo for talks Thursday or Friday
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, who helped broker the Bosnian
peace accord.
	   After talks with Rugova, Kinkel urged Western powers to increase
pressure on Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw forces
from Kosovo, and to make clear that NATO is considering military
intervention.
	   The foreign minister also called on militant Albanians to follow
the pacifist Rugova in renouncing violence.
	   Kinkel said NATO should try to secure Russia's support for
intervention in Kosovo, as it did for its U.N.-mandated
intervention in Bosnia. So far, Russia has opposed Western military
pressure on Yugoslavia, its longtime ally.
	   ``Why can't NATO and Russia go together, as they did in
Bosnia?'' Kinkel asked. ``We don't want to attack anyone. We just
want to restore order on the ground.''
	   NATO officials have urged Rugova to resume peace talks with
Milosevic, without making independence for Kosovo a pre-condition.
But Rugova said Wednesday the ``climate'' was not right for talks,
and reiterated his demands for Kosovo's secession.
	   He suggested that Kosovo could be made an international
protectorate as an interim step, including safety guarantees for
the province's Serb minority.
	   Kinkel said he made clear to Rugova that Germany and most
Western powers oppose independence for Kosovo, but want to see its
autonomy restored. Milosevic stripped Kosovo of its broad autonomy
in 1989 and introduced virtual martial law.

Greek labor not buying into drive for fiscal turnaround 
</HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MURPHY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Silent train stations, idled airplanes and
even a few bomb blasts are the results of the government's efforts
to introduce economic reforms with labor groups that refuse to
budge.
	   A rail strike Wednesday was the latest addition to a rising wall
of protest against the government's attempts to trim Greece's
crushing debt by selling off state companies and restructuring
others.
	   Without the reforms, the government claims, Greece risks being
blackballed from the European Union's single currency club and
becoming an economic backwater.
	   But the backlash _ which has recently degenerated into raw
violence _ goes beyond just trying to protect jobs. Premier Costas
Simitis is tampering with a hallowed Socialist pact _ a vast public
sector with protected and lifetime employment.
	   Simitis' harshest critics have accused him of what amounts to
political heresy in his Socialist party. They say he is tearing
down the populist policies of his predecessor, Andreas Papandreou,
who led the powerful Socialist party until his death in 1996.
	   ``Andreas, rise and see what they've done,'' union activists
chanted Sunday at Papandreou's grave during a ceremony marking the
second anniversary of his death.
	   With the promise of state-sheltered employment under direct
assault for the first time, there are worries that strikes and
violence could escalate during the peak tourism season.
	   Simitis, however, has insisted he will not back off his reform
plan _ regardless of the outcry. He has made entry into the EU
single currency by 2001 the top agenda of his government.
	   ``Small groups armed with violence cannot block the growth of
our country,'' he vowed last week.
	   But it appears that the harder the government presses for
reforms, the harsher the response.
	   A firebomb damaged the private office of Greece's labor minister
in April. Port workers have staged repeated work stoppages,
stranding ferry passengers and cargo.
	   Strikes and protests against trimming debt-bloated Olympic
Airways became so disruptive this spring that Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos quipped that ``no logical person'' would fly the
state carrier.
	   Last week, workers from Ionian Bank stormed a shareholder's
meeting that was called to vote on a plan to sell 51.4 percent of
Greece's fourth-largest bank. Protesters flipped over tables and
even tore at the clothes of a bank official.
	   Shareholders reconvened later _ with riot police outside the
building _ to approve the sale plan.
	   Ionian workers returned to their jobs Monday after a six-week
strike. The same day, though, a pipe bomb damaged a branch of
private Alpha Credit Bank, whose owner has expressed interest in
acquiring Ionian.
	   And still to come are some of the toughest privatization
projects, including the bus and rail networks. The effort is
expected to raise 800 billion drachmas (dlrs 2.6 billion), of which
more than two-thirds should go into the state treasury.
	   The unwavering spirit of the Ionian strikers and the
government's back pedal on some Olympic cost-saving reforms could
embolden other labor groups, market watchers predicted.
	   ``If the government makes too many concessions to the workers,
this will be seen as a precedent for other privatizations,'' said
Vasilis Kletsas, an analyst at the Telesis Securities brokerage
firm in Athens.
	   Despite ramming ahead with the Ionian plan, some commentators
have depicted the government as ill-prepared to deal with the labor
unrest.
	   ``The government, clearly ineffective, cannot enforce its
decisions,'' said an editorial in the respected Kathimerini
newspaper. ``It neither controls events nor reacts to them ... it
looks on helplessly.''

Two Israelis killed, four wounded in south Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Israel confirming casualties, CORRECTS in 11th
graf number of Israeli soldiers wounded
By AHMED MANTASH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas attacked Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon early Thursday, killing two soldiers and
wounding four, officials said.
	   In retaliation, Israeli helicopters strafed guerrilla
infiltration trails with machine guns, and ground guns fired 15
mortar bombs and about 40 shells of 155 mm caliber, the officials
said. There was no word on casualties.
	   The attack came as preparations were underway to return the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed in South Lebanon last year in
exchange for bodies of Lebanese guerrillas and prisoners held by
Israel.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah said in a statement that its
fighters detonated two bomb within a space of 15 minutes near an
Israeli patrol and raked the area with ``appropriate weapons'' as
reinforcements arrived at the scene.
	   Israeli helicopters and several ambulances were seen rushing to
the area to evacuate the casualties, the statement added.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the attack happened
when the Israeli patrol was traveling to military exercises. He
identified the dead as Lt. Amit Asulin, 21, and Sgt. Or Cohen, 19.
	   Three of the four wounded soldiers were in serious condition, he
said.
	   The attack occurred near Houla, 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the
Israeli border and about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of
Sidon, provincial capital of South Lebanon. Large parts of the area
are occupied by Israel and Hezbollah and other militias are
fighting to evict Israeli soldiers.
	   Timur Goksel, a spokesman for a United Nations peacekeeping
force in southern Lebanon, reported heavy firing from both sides
involving mortars, machine guns and big jeep-mounted rifles capable
of knocking out tanks.
	   The incident is unlikely to affect the prisoner and body
exchange, which was agreed upon after 10 months of tortuous
negotiations involving the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
	   Thursday's fatalities raised to eight killed and 66 wounded the
number of Israeli losses in southern Lebanon this year. The last
Israeli casualties in South Lebanon were on May 28 when two
soldiers were killed in an ambush.
	   In 1997, 39 Israeli soldiers were killed in guerrilla attacks, a
record annual figure since 1985 when Israel declared the occupied
area a security zone meant to protect its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.
	   Among last year's dead were 12 soldiers killed in a botched
commando raid on Sept. 5. The Israelis recovered all except one
body _ that of Sgt. Itamar Ilya whose remains are at the crux of
the imminent swap.
	   News reports in Lebanon and Israel have said that Ilya's remains
will be returned home later Thursday and Israel will hand over the
bodies of 40 guerrillas and release more than 60 prisoners.
	   Some of the prisoners are held in Israel but most are detained
in the occupied zone in the south.

Malaysian PM: IMF-like policies have devastated economy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Economic policies endorsed by the
International Monetary Fund have devastated Malaysia's economy, the
prime minister said Thursday.
	   ``Initially, we thought that IMF strategies were very good. But
they have damaged our economy,'' Mahathir said.
	   ``We're trying to figure out how to manage our economy after the
damage has been done,'' Mahathir added.
	   Mahathir made the comments to reporters when asked why he had
appointed Daim Zainuddin, a close confidant, to a Cabinet-level
post aimed at rectifying the economic damage. The appointment
announced Wednesday seemed a political brush to Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Last December, Anwar introduced an austerity program to curb
inflation and protect the currency, the ringgit, which many
economists welcomed as an IMF-like program.
	   Among the measures were an 18 percent cut in government spending
and a commitment to maintain a tight monetary policy.
	   Anwar and Bank Negara, the central bank, have been arguing that
interest rates, currently at 12 to 16 percent, should stay firm to
prevent capital flight.
	   Mahathir, however, favors high-growth policies and looser
interest rates. He has blamed Anwar's tough economic measures for
causing the country's economy to shrink by 1.8 percent in the first
quarter of the year.
	   That shrinkage compares with 6.9 percent growth in the final
quarter last year. Economists are predicting a full-blown recession
for Malaysia this year as the full impact of Asia's financial
crisis kicks in.
	   Malaysia, unlike its economically battered neighbors, Indonesia
and Thailand, has resisted turning to the IMF for financial
support.
	   There already are signs that Malaysia is ready to abandon the
IMF-sanctioned policies favored by Anwar. A new formula is being
devised to calculate interest rates and government spending is
being increased by 13 percent, or 7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8
billion).

More than 100 hospitalized as heat wave sweeps Athens 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ More than 100 people were hospitalized
Thursday as a dangerous heat wave swept the city, with temperatures
soaring to 37 degrees Celsius (99 degrees F) for a second day in a
row.
	   Hospitals and ambulances went on alert as pollution exceeded
warning levels in the Greek capital, officials said. Most of the
people treated Thursday suffered from dehydration, fainting and
other heat-related symptoms.
	   If the heat wave continues as forecasters have predicted,
authorities plan to set up special air-conditioned rooms for
elderly people and those with respiratory problems.
	   A heat wave in 1987 was blamed for more than 900 deaths around
Greece.

Third player returns positive test 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby league player Rodney
Howe has become the third player this season to return a positive
test to a performance-enhancing drug.
	   National Rugby League chief executive Neil Whittaker confirmed
Thursday that Howe's Melbourne club had informed him of the State
of Origin players' positive test.
	   Whittaker said he had not received official notification from
the Australian Sports Drug Agency.
	   Howe, who played Super League last season and faces a possible
two-year suspension, follows other high-profile players Robbie
O'Davis and Wayne Richards in returning positive tests this season.
	   The NRL tested players from four teams after last weekend's
matches after O'Davis missed punishment on a technicality.

U.S. envoy meets with Milosevic in Kosovo shuttle talks reported killed, Rugova citing `ethnic cleansing' in talks in Germany, Kinkel remarks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke-Milosevic talks under way, Serb teacher
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After declaring again that Serb
forces must ``get out'' of Kosovo, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
began a hectic round of new talks Thursday aimed at stopping the
fighting in the embattled Yugoslav province.
	   Trying to head off the need for threatened NATO intervention in
Kosovo, Holbrooke sat down with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for the second time in three days, Yugoslav media said.
	   Later, he was to meet with a Russian envoy before heading back
to Kosovo to talk with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the
provincial capital Pristina Thursday night or Friday.
	   Holbrooke, who helped persuade Milosevic to sign a peace
settlement to end the war in Bosnia, gave no indication that the
Yugoslav leader was close to agreeing to a cease-fire and pullback
demanded by the West.
	   ``This is all part of a process,'' he told CNN in Kosovo before
heading back to Belgrade late Wednesday. ``I wouldn't want to get
your expectations up that we're going to have any breakthroughs,
because the situation is quite difficult.''
	   Holbrooke traveled into the heart of the Kosovo conflict zone
Wednesday and met with ethnic Albanian militants for the first
time, broadening efforts to end the fighting before all-out war
erupts.
	   His tour of heavy fighting areas in the secessionist province of
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, highlighted a shuttle
diplomacy mission that many see as a last-ditch bid to stop the
conflict before NATO intervenes.
	   ``The situation is explosive,'' he said on a stop in the
besieged town of Junik near the Albanian border. ``Serb security
forces are all over the place.''
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died since
fighting escalated in March between Serb-led army and police forces
and the Kosovo Liberation Army. NATO sent jets zooming over the
region earlier this month to persuade Milosevic to stop the
campaign against the rebels, but fighting continues unabated.
	   On a 300-kilometer (nearly 200-mile) tour of western Kosovo,
Holbrooke rode with three ethnic Albanian officials and had
protection for his 14-car convoy from a truckload of Serb security
forces carrying automatic rifles. He called it a ``traveling
negotiation.''
	   He dismissed any political significance to his talks with two
local Kosovo Liberation Army leaders in Junik, calling them only
unofficial meetings with ``armed men, some of whom were in (KLA)
uniforms.''
	   But observers saw the unprecedented meeting as tacit
acknowledgement that the fast-growing KLA, which has the support of
increasing numbers of Kosovo's majority Albanians, must be taken
into account in any political settlement.
	   Graphic evidence of the worsening situation in Kosovo was
plentiful on the trip.
	   On a tour through fire-blackened and damaged houses and
half-emptied villages, explosions and gunfire could be heard and
armored personnel carriers and military convoys rumbled down the
main road. Reporters following Holbrooke's convoy were caught in
the crossfire of a gunfight between Serbs and Albanian guerrillas.
	   On Thursday, the Serbs' Media Center said armed Albanians had
killed a Serb schoolteacher in an attack on the village of Kijevo
west of Pristina late Wednesday.
	   Rugova met with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn on
Thursday and intensified his appeal for NATO intervention, accusing
Serbs again of ``ethnic cleansing.'' He was to meet with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl later.
	   Kinkel said NATO should try to secure Russian support for
intervention in Kosovo, as it did in Bosnia.
	   ``We don't want to attack anyone,'' Kinkel said. ``We just want
to restore order on the ground.''

Town councilor killed in suspected Basque separatist attack 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A bomb attack on Thursday believed
carried out by the Basque separatist group ETA killed a governing
party councilor in this northern town, national Spanish radio
reported.
	   Manuel Zamarreno of the Popular Party died after a vehicle
carrying a bomb hit his car and exploded shortly after 11 a.m.
(0900 GMT), the radio reported. One other person in Zamarreno's car
was injured.
	   If the bombing is confirmed as an ETA attack, Zamarreno would be
the sixth victim of the militant Basque group so far this year.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed nearly 800 people since launching its campaign for an
independent Basque state in 1968.

Indonesian need for rice should lift Thai exports 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A rice shortfall in Indonesia should
lift Thailand's exports this year to at least 5.8 million tons, up
500,000 tons from earlier predictions, a top rice exporting
official said Thursday.
	   Thailand, the world's top rice exporter, shipped 3.3 million
tons of rice abroad between January and June, a 60 percent increase
over the same period last year, said Somboon Pathaichant, manager
of the Thai Rice Exports Association.
	   Somboon said Indonesia is likely to need 5 million tons from
Thailand and other countries this year.
	   The decline of the Thai currency since the Asian financial
crisis erupted last year has stimulated demand for Thai rice by
making it cheaper than its rivals.
	   But the currency fluctuation could mean that exports might not
increase in baht terms over 1997, despite expectations that imports
of Thai rice will double in Indonesia and the Philippines.

New Philippine carrier expands fleet amid strike at Philippine Airlines 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Air Philippines, a new domestic
carrier, is advancing its expansion plans to take advantage of a
strike that has disrupted flights at flag carrier Philippine
Airlines, officials said Thursday.
	   The carrier, owned by Chinese-Filipino businessman William
Gathalian, said it plans to lease three more airplanes to increase
its domestic flights and begin serving international routes.
	   Airline spokeswoman Cristina Mojica said one of the three
McDonnell-Douglas MD-88 planes began flying between Manila and
central Cebu on Thursday. The airline plans to begin flights to
Taiwan later this year using the other planes, which will be
delivered in a few weeks, she said.
	   The airline, which began operating in 1996, currently has six
Boeing 737-200s and two Japanese-made YS-11s.
	   Mojica said the airline also has applied for Philippine
government permission to fly to South Korea and Singapore.
	   She said its passengers have increased dramatically since the
start of the strike by pilots at PAL, the dominant domestic
carrier.
	   The strike, which began June 5, has forced PAL to reduce its
flights by about 80 percent and brought Asia's oldest airline to
the brink of closure.

Eds: CORRECTS day of attack to Thursday sted Wednesday; RECASTS
<TEXT>
	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A governing party politician was killed
Thursday in an attack believed to be carried out by the armed
Basque separatist group ETA, six months after an ETA gunman shot
dead his predecessor, national Spanish radio reported.
	   Manuel Zamarreno, a Popular Party councilor in this northern
Basque town, died after vehicle carrying bomb hit his car and
exploded at about 11 a.m. (0900GMT), national Spanish radio
reported.
	   The councilor's bodyguard was also injured in the attack, the
radio said.
	   Zamarreno replaced Jose Luis Caso in the Renteria town council
last month. Caso was shot dead by an ETA gunman in bar on December
11 last year.
	   If proved to be the work of ETA, Zamarreno will be the group's
sixth victim so far this year.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its campaign for an

Human rights group opposes forced conscription in Yugoslavia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A Hungarian human rights organization
demanded Thursday that European leaders do everything in their
power to end forced conscription in Yugoslavia.
	   ``Through conscription they (in Yugoslavia) force those ethnic
groups into the conflict, among them the Hungarians, who do not
want to wage war against anybody,'' the Alba Circle group said in
the appeal.
	   An estimated 400,000 Hungarians live in Serbia's northern
province of Vojvodina, which, like Kosovo, was stripped of its
autonomy in 1989.
	   ``We do not have exact figures, but we know that in a garrison
close to Pristina there are 300 ethnic Hungarian soldiers at this
moment, and we also know that the Hungarians are deployed in
strategically important places,'' said Lajos Balla of the
Federation of Hungarians in Vojvodina, who signed the appeal.
	   Alba Circle's appeal was also addressed to Hungary's prime
minister designate, Viktor Orban.
	   ``We request Europe's governments, churches, peoples and the
United Nations to accept the right to stay away from a war as a
basic human right,'' the appeal concluded.

World Cup: Romania and Tunisia meet in low-stakes game 
</HEADLINE>
By VIOREL URMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ It may look more like a warmup than a World
Cup game when Romania meets Tunisia on Friday. The North Africans
have already been eliminated and will be playing for pride. Romania
needs to play just well enough to protect its Group G lead.
	   After edging England 2-1 and and Colombia 1-0, Romania tops the
group standings with six points, earning a place in the knockout
second stage.
	   The underdog Tunisians, who lost to 2-0 to England and 1-0 to
Colombia, have no chance of advancing to the second round even if
they pull off an upset. Tunisian soccer officials were so upset by
the failure of defensive tactics that they fired coach Henry
Kasperczak and replaced him with Ali el-Selmi, his former
assistant.
	   The Romanians don't figure to face much trouble from Tunisia.
Still, they can't afford a letdown that could cost them top spot in
the group. England and Colombia, with three points each, meet in
the group's other game Friday to decide the second qualifying team.
	   ``We want to get first place at all costs. It proves that we
deserved to be picked as the seeded team,'' coach Anghel Iordanescu
said.
	   ``We didn't expect to make the second stage after only two
games, but we must win again,'' said defender Dan Petrescu, after
team practice at 80,000-seat Stade de France on Wednesday night.
	   Actually, a draw against Tunisia would be good enough. The
additional point would give Romania seven, an insurmountable margin
in Group G.
	   Romania's two victories cost a toll in injuries.
	   Ovidiu Stanga, an attacking midfielder who plays for PSV
Eindhoven, was sent to The Netherlands for treatment after he tore
ligaments in his left knee in the game against England. He'll be
out for several months.
	   Other players with physical complaints are Gabriel Popescu of
Salamanca, who has a nose injury, Valencia's striker Adrian Ilie,
who suffered a head injury, and sweeper Gheorghe Popescu of
Galatasaray, with a bruised leg.
	   ``We hope that all of them will be fit to play against
Tunisia,'' said Costica Stefanescu, a Romanian assistant coach.
	   Sitting out a one-game suspension after getting two yellow cards
is midfielder Iulian Filipescu.
	   Iordanescu is likely to try several second-string players and
rest some of his stars who bore the brunt of Romania's battles
against England and Colombia.
	   Among them are 25-year-old midfielder Lucian Marinescu, forward
Radu Niculescu, 23, and veteran striker Marius Lacatus, 34, who all
play in Romania's first division.
	   The Romanians probably want to save some of their standout
players like Petrescu and midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, who have
already been booked.
	   These players are badly needed in the round-of-16 game on June
30 in which Romania would meet either Croatia or Argentina,
depending on how these Group H teams place.
	   While Tunisia has been demoralized by two losses after coming to
France with higher expectations, Romania isn't taking the North
Africans lightly.
	   ``I don't think the Tunisians have a match-winning player, but
they are a well organized team,'' Ilie, who scored Romania's winner
against Colombia, told reporters.
	   Tunisia was the first African team to win a match in the World
Cup finals when it beat Mexico in the tournament in Argentina in
1978.
	   But Tunisia's hopes of reaping more benefits in France went by
the board in the tough group it was drawn into.

Three Thai Muslim women forced into prostitution in Saudi Arabia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Three Thai Muslim women who thought
they were making a religious pilgrimage but instead were forced
into prostitution in Saudi Arabia have been rescued and returned to
their homeland, a Thai legislator said Thursday.
	   Paveena Hongsakul, known for her concern about prostitutes, said
the three women _ aged between 20 and 27 _ were lured by their
neighbor to join a pilgrimage with the added promise of a good
paying job for them afterward.
	   ``I was informed that they were locked up in a room upon their
arrival and forced into prostitution in a tightly controlled
brothel,'' said Paveena.
	   She said an unidentified Thai businessman had paid the brothel
230,000 baht (dlrs 5,500) for the freedom of two of the women,
telling the owner they would be his housemaids. The third woman
escaped the brothel on her own.
	   All three returned to Bangkok Tuesday.
	   The three women did not know the name of the city where they
were forced to work, Paveena said. They are currently undergoing
medical checkups and have been placed under the care of the Public
Welfare Department.
	   Paveena said the international police agency Interpol and the
Thai Foreign Ministry have been informed of the incident, and have
been asked to strengthen cooperation with Saudi Arabian authorities
to look into the matter.
	   She said legal action will be taken against the neighbor.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A seating balcony holding dozens of people
collapsed Thursday during a wrestling competition in southern
Russia, killing four and injuring 19, officials said.
	   The accident occurred about 11:40 a.m. (0740 GMT) during the
Russian national wrestling competition, when a 50-meter-long
(160-foot-long) balcony collapsed onto the floor of the indoor
stadium, said Viktor Beltsov, a spokesman for Russia's Emergencies
Ministry.
	   It was not immediately clear how far the balcony fell, or
whether there were people on the floor underneath at the time,
Beltsov said. However, rescue workers were trying to locate
additional victims who may be trapped beneath the debris, he said.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in the southern city of Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers
(850 miles) south of Moscow.
	   The cause of the accident was not immediately known, he said.
	   Many of Russia's public buildings are in poor repair since
government funding for state facilities has all but disappeared
since the Soviet collapse.

Ugandan rebels abduct 19 school children, 14 later freed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels abducted 19 primary school
children and a teacher near a northern Uganda garrison town, but 14
of the children were later freed, and the teacher escaped, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army carried out the operation
Tuesday in Gulu, 360 kilometers (223 miles) north of Kampala, the
government-owned New Vision newspaper reported.
	   It did not say whether the children were boys or girls.
	   St. Joe Primary School in a Gulu suburb was one of three places
attacked by the rebels. A major military base 3 kilometers (2
miles) from the town center was not hit.
	   The rebels, who have been fighting to oust President Yoweri
Museveni for 11 years, routinely kidnap school boys and girls. The
youngsters are given military training and some of the girls forced
to become ``wives'' to rebel officers and favored soldiers.
	   On June 20, the LRA attacked another school in northern Uganda
and abducted 40 girls.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch estimates that the
Sudan-based LRA has abducted between 8,000 and 10,000 children from
northern Uganda.
	   The fighting has forced at least 300,000 people to flee their
homes, most of them to villages that are supposed to be protected
by the army but are often attacked by rebels.
	   Earlier this month, another rebel group, the Allied Democratic
Forces, attacked a training college near Kabarole, 200 miles west
of Kampala. When students refused to come out, they set fire to
three dormitories, killing at least 80 students. More than 100
students from the college are missing and presumed abducted.

World Cup: Striker duel, 1996 memories mark Argentina vs. Croatia

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Argentina and newcomer Croatia, both
already assured of a place in the second round, battle each other
in Bordeaux on Friday for the top qualifying spot in their World
Cup group.
	   Croatia's aging defense is forewarned after Argentine star
striker Gabriel Batistuta tallied three times in a 5-0 rout of
Jamaica last weekend and vaulted to the top of the scorers' list
with four goals.
	   On the other end, Croatian top scorer Davor Suker will need to
improve his marksmanship after wasting several chances against
Japan before knocking in the late 1-0 that lifted Croatia into the
next round.
	   No changes are expected in Argentina's front line, but coach
Daniel Passarella will be missing Roberto Sensini, his most
experienced defender, and is also tipped to rest one of his regular
midfielders.
	   Croatia is heartened by the return of team captain and playmaker
Zvonimir Boban, who sat out the Japan game with a pulled leg
muscle.
	   Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic has promised to field his
strongest team. He is intent on an upset win against Argentina, a
two-time world champion, to wipe out bad memories from a similar
situation in the 1996 European Championship in England.
	   There, Blazevic deliberately sent on a weak team that lost the
last group game against Portugal and gave Croatia his preferred
opponent, Germany, in the quarterfinals.
	   The Croatians then lost 2-1 to Germany, the eventual European
champion, and Blazevic nearly lost his job.
	   Blazevic pumped himself up on the eve of Friday's game. ``I
won't pull any such trick this time. We don't have any false
respect for Argentina,'' he said. ``My team is the best.''
	   Argentina last won the championship in 1986 with Diego Maradona
and are considered contenders this year.
	   After downing Jamaica and defeating Japan 1-0, the South
Americans need only a draw to finish atop the group and set up a
second-round game with the Group G runnerup _ most likely England
or Colombia. Croatia, which beat Jamaica only 3-1, can expect to
face Romania unless it wins on Friday.
	   Passarella is expected to replace AC Parma's Sensini, who has a
pulled leg muscle, with Nelson Vivas. Word from the Argentinian
camp is that the coach also may rest left back Jose Chamot because
he has already been cautioned once.
	   Croatia's only absentee is veteran defender Igor Stimac,
suffering from blistered feet. Silvio Maric will take his spot.
	   Croatia and Argentina are meeting for the first time, but one
Croatian player has already faced the South Americans in the World
Cup: Midfielder Robert Prosinecki played in the 1990 Yugoslav squad
that was eliminated by Argentina in the quarterfinals after a
penalty shootout.

Ukrainian border guard kills five comrades

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian border guard stationed in
Crimea shot and killed five of his comrades Thursday and
disappeared from his unit, officials said.
	   The shooting occurred early in the morning at a border guards'
base near the Crimean town of Alupka on the Black Sea, the Defense
Ministry said. Those killed included an officer, a sergeant and
three soldiers, it added.
	   The ministry could not immediately provide further details.
	   Units of border guards and interior troops backed by Security
Service agents were looking for the soldier, who was drafted last
fall in the capital Kiev, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Shooting attacks have become frequent in the often demoralized
and poorly funded armies of the former Soviet states, especially in
neighboring Russia.
	   Many shooting sprees are blamed on hazing, which is common in
the armed forces of the former Soviet Union and involves physical
and psychological abuse of recruits by older servicemen.
	   In 1997, five people were killed and 44 others were disabled in
some 143 hazing episodes in the Ukrainian military, which has about
400,000 servicemen, according to military prosecutors. In January
1998, a private at a missile base shot two other servicemen to
avenge hazing and then killed himself.

Strikes in Russian Far East threaten new energy cuts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Over 600 state workers in Russia's Far East
protested outside a local administration building on Thursday,
demanding 15 months of back pay, a news agency reported.
	   Employees of the Zvezda submarine-repair plant, located outside
the Pacific port city of Vladivostok, denounced the governor's
claim that the federal government, not local officials, are to
blame for the arrears, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Workers at a local heating plant are also on strike, and the
recent stoppage of an electric power station has prompted fears
that power cuts may hit Vladivostok, the news agency said.
	   The protest followed road blockages and rallies that took place
around the Far East on Tuesday.

On eve of summit, Taiwan's president reiterates desire to reunify 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Lee Teng-hui on Thursday
rededicated Taiwan to eventual unification with China, but said
Beijing shouldn't try to dictate terms.
	   Speaking hours before U.S. President Bill Clinton was to arrive
in China for talks expected to include Taiwan, Lee said the
island's determination to reunify with China was
``unquestionable.''
	   But he said reunification can only come after China is free and
democratic, and again rejected a Hong Kong-type one China-two
systems model that would permit Taiwan considerable autonomy under
a central government.
	   Lee's comments, delivered to a visiting Honduran delegation,
contained nothing new. But coming as Clinton flew to China, they
could be seen as an attempt to dampen the effect of Chinese demands
for concessions on U.S. support for Taiwan.
	   Taiwan says it will take measures that could increase regional
tensions if the United States caves in to such demands.
	   Clinton should uphold promises to maintain backing for Taiwan
when he meets Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing over the
weekend, said Wu An-chia, a vice chairman of the Cabinet's Mainland
Affairs Council.
	   If the summit ``harms our interests, our government will take
drastic measures ... and I believe the United States government is
clear on this point,'' Wu told reporters.
	   Wu would not say exactly what Taiwan might do, but said the
measures would ``not benefit'' relations between Taiwan and China,
which have one of the most intractable and dangerous relationships
in Asia. Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949, and
China considers the island a renegade province to be reunited with
the mainland by force if necessary.
	   Their ties hit a low in 1996, when China lobbed missiles into
waters close to Taiwan in hopes of intimidating supporters of the
island's independence. Washington responded by stationing a pair of
aircraft carrier battle groups near Taiwan.
	   Beijing wants Clinton to agree to curtail arms sales to Taiwan
and firmly restate or put in writing Washington's pledges not to
recognize an independent Taiwan or support its entry into the
United Nations.
	   The government says it has been assured by Washington that
Clinton will not alter U.S. policy toward Taiwan or concede to
Chinese demands to backtrack on pledges to the island.
	   Washington severed relations with Taipei in 1979 to recognize
Beijing, but it maintains strong unofficial ties with Taiwan and is
its main arms supplier.

<TEXT>
	   LI FAMILY VILLAGE, China (AP) _ In one rural hamlet, Chinese
farmers haul water from a pipe jutting through stones above the
muddy ground. In another, they drive motorcycles over paved roads
and end their day watching cable television.
	   Two villages, two views of rural China.
	   But Chinese pride, along with U.S. President Bill Clinton's
schedule and political needs, dictate that the U.S. visitor will
see only the prosperous half.
	   ``They chose Xiahe village because it's rich. We're poor,'' said
one member of nearby Li Family Village, who only gave his surname,
Li.
	   In wealthy Xiahe, an hour's drive east of provincial Xi'an city,
primary schoolers in crisp red and white band uniforms drummed a
march a day before Clinton's arrival as their schoolmates waved
bouquets of silk flowers in salute. Uniformed commercial bureau
inspectors chalked lines on the roadside to mark places where
villagers may display the trinkets they make during Friday's
welcome.
	   History's fate and those wares _ embroidered shirts, bags and
animals of the Chinese zodiac _ are the source of Xiahe's wealth.
The village abuts the excavated pits housing an army of life-sized
terra cotta warriors, protectors for the afterlife of China's first
emperor and perhaps the nation's greatest tourist draw after the
Great Wall.
	   Xiahe residents sell their goods at the entrance to the terra
cotta army, and family incomes, by official count, on average top
dlrs 1,500 a year _ more than twice the average for the province.
Two-story homes of brick and cement line the village's
cement-covered streets. The government says that the village has 42
telephone lines and televisions in all but 1 percent of the 323
households.
	   ``I need one to two months a year to do my farming,'' said Xiahe
resident Sun Baowa as he bricked up a hole in a wall near the
school latrine. The rest of the time Sun spends laboring in one of
the village's booming construction businesses.
	   A Chinese official working on preparations for Clinton's visit,
who refused to give his hame, said Xiahe was chosen because Clinton
would be viewing the terra cotta army and because of its standard
of living, even though most nearby villages are equally prosperous.
	   The Li Family Village, a short drive away on a pockmarked dirt
road up a dusty foothill from Xiahe, is not on the itinerary. Women
wash clothes on stone slabs above the muddy rivulets next to the
village water pipe. Their men sift and haul gravel from nearby
hillsides.
	   ``If we didn't do coolie labor, we would starve,'' said the
farmer surnamed Li.
	   Family plots on average are only about .2 acres (.1 hectares)
and the soil is sandier and water level lower than in Xiahe,
villagers said.
	   Villagers complained they would not be allowed to sell
vegetables in Xiahe on the day Clinton comes.
	   There was also confusion among Li Family villagers over whether
they would be allowed to line the roadside to see Clinton's
motorcade. One man said villagers were told not to go. Others said
they could but added they would likely be busy spraying pesticide
on their persimmon trees.
	   ``The leaders never told us why he wanted to come,'' said
Xiahe's Sun. ``We're just farmers.''

U.S. envoy meets with Milosevic in Kosovo shuttle talks reported killed, Rugova citing `ethnic cleansing' in talks in Germany, Kinkel remarks.

Eds: UPDATES with Holbrooke-Milosevic talks under way, Serb teacher
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After declaring again that Serb
forces must ``get out'' of Kosovo, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
began a hectic round of talks Thursday aimed at stopping the
fighting in the Yugoslav province.
	   Trying to head off the need for threatened NATO intervention in
Kosovo, Holbrooke sat down with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for the second time in three days, Yugoslav media said.
	   Later, he was to meet with a Russian envoy before heading back
to Kosovo to talk with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the
provincial capital Pristina on Thursday night or Friday.
	   Holbrooke, who helped persuade Milosevic to sign a peace
settlement to end the war in Bosnia, gave no indication that the
Yugoslav leader was close to agreeing to a cease-fire and pullback
demanded by the West.
	   ``This is all part of a process,'' he told CNN in Kosovo before
heading back to Belgrade late Wednesday. ``I wouldn't want to get
your expectations up that we're going to have any breakthroughs,
because the situation is quite difficult.''
	   Holbrooke traveled into the heart of the Kosovo conflict zone
Wednesday and met with ethnic Albanian militants for the first
time, broadening efforts to end the fighting before all-out war
erupts.
	   His tour of heavy fighting areas in the secessionist province
that is part of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia,
highlighted a shuttle diplomacy mission that many see as a
last-ditch bid to stop the conflict before NATO intervenes.
	   ``The situation is explosive,'' he said during a stop in the
besieged town of Junik near the Albanian border. ``Serb security
forces are all over the place.''
	   More than 300 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died since
fighting escalated in March between Serb-led army and police forces
and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence
from Yugoslavia. NATO sent jets zooming over the region earlier
this month to persuade Milosevic to stop the campaign against the
rebels, but fighting continues unabated.
	   On a 300-kilometer (nearly 200-mile) tour of western Kosovo,
Holbrooke rode with three ethnic Albanian officials and had
protection for his 14-car convoy from a truckload of Serb security
forces carrying automatic rifles. He called it a ``traveling
negotiation.''
	   He dismissed any political significance to his talks with two
local Kosovo Liberation Army leaders in Junik, calling them only
unofficial meetings with ``armed men, some of whom were in (KLA)
uniforms.''
	   But observers saw the unprecedented meeting as tacit
acknowledgement that the fast-growing KLA, which has the support of
increasing numbers of Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians, must be
taken into account in any political settlement.
	   Graphic evidence of the worsening situation in Kosovo was
plentiful on the trip.
	   On a tour through fire-blackened and damaged houses and
half-emptied villages, explosions and gunfire could be heard and
armored personnel carriers and military convoys rumbled down the
main road. Reporters following Holbrooke's convoy were caught in
the crossfire of a gunfight between Serbs and Albanian guerrillas.
	   On Thursday, the Serbs' Media Center said armed Albanians had
killed a Serb schoolteacher in an attack on the village of Kijevo
west of Pristina late Wednesday.
	   Rugova met with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in Bonn on
Thursday and intensified his appeal for NATO intervention, accusing
Serbs again of ``ethnic cleansing.'' He was to meet with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl later.
	   Kinkel said NATO should try to secure Russian support for
intervention in Kosovo, as it did in Bosnia.
	   ``We don't want to attack anyone,'' Kinkel said. ``We just want
to restore order on the ground.''

Hyundai to follow up on tourism agreement with North Korea 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Hyundai group said
Thursday its executives will visit North Korea in early July to
follow up on plans for tourism and other projects.
	   Chung Ju-yung, founder-owner of the nation's second largest
conglomerate, returned from an eight-day visit to his native North
Korea this week with agreements for several joint ventures.
	   The projects include Hyundai's plan to start sightseeing tours
this fall of Diamond Mountain, a major tourist site near Tongchun,
Chung's birthplace on the North's east coast.
	   Hyundai said it will send a 20-member delegation to North Korea
on July 5 to follow up on the tourism and other joint-venture
agreements signed during Chung's visit.
	   Other projects include the relocation of some of Hyundai Motors
Co.'s subcompact car assembly lines. North Korean labor costs are
cheap _ about one-eighth of those in South Korea, Hyundai said.
	   Hyundai also agreed to hire North Korean workers for its
overseas construction projects and invest in a project in North
Korea to dismantle old ships for scrap metal.
	   The Seoul government has promised to support Chung's tourism
project, seeing it as helping to promote peace on the divided
Korean Peninsula.
	   Under its ``sunshine policy,'' the new South Korean government
of President Kim Dae-jung is encouraging non-governmental exchanges
and cooperation with the North.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war, with
no peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Israel awaits return of soldier's remains 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In phase two of a swap with Lebanese
guerrillas, Israel on Thursday awaited the return of the body of an
Israeli soldier killed in an ambush last year.
	   Just hours before the planned exchange of the remains for scores
of Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas, two Israeli soldiers were
killed by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, but the violence was not
expected to scuttle the deal.
	   A successful swap might give new impetus to efforts by Israel to
engage the Beirut government in negotiations on security
arrangements following an Israeli troop withdrawal from southern
Lebanon. The Lebanese government has refused to do so, saying U.N.
resolutions require Israel to leave without conditions.
	   The exchange was set in motion Wednesday when Israel began
digging up the bodies of 40 guerrillas killed in clashes in Israel,
including that of a son of Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah.
	   On Thursday evening, the remains of the Israeli soldier, Sgt.
1st Class Itamar Iliya, were to arrive in Israel aboard a French
plane. Israel is to examine the body before returning the Hezbollah
guerrillas' remains to Beirut aboard the same plane.
	   On Friday, some 65 Hezbollah guerrillas were to be freed, about
15 from Israeli jails and 50 from the Khiam lockup in south Lebanon
run by an Israeli-allied militia, the South Lebanon Army.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A moderately strong earthquake rattled the town
of Aksu in northwestern Xinjiang on Thursday, but there were no
immediate reports of casualties or damage, China's official Xinhua
News Agency reported.
	   The report said the 5.2 magnitude quake struck at 2:39 p.m.
(0639 GMT) in the remote oasis, some 650 kilometers (400 miles)
southwest of the regional capital, Urumqi.
	   Xinjiang is one of earthquake-prone China's most seismically
active regions. A 6.2-magnitude quake that hit farther to the
south, in Pishan and Moyu counties on May 29, injured 28 people and
caused heavy damage.
	   In January 1997, two successive, powerful quakes shook Jiashi
County, southwest of Aksu, killing 12 people. In March 1996,
another quake killed 24 people.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A balcony holding dozens of people collapsed
Thursday during a wrestling competition in southern Russia, killing
at least 14 people, officials said. Forty more were injured.
	   The accident occurred about 11:40 a.m. (0740 GMT) during the
Russian national wrestling competition, when a 50-meter-long
(160-foot-long) balcony collapsed onto the floor of the indoor
stadium, said Viktor Beltsov, a spokesman for Russia's Emergencies
Ministry.
	   It was not immediately clear how far the balcony fell, or
whether there were people on the floor underneath at the time,
Beltsov said. However, rescue workers were trying to locate
additional victims who may be trapped beneath the debris, he said.
	   Three hours after the accident, the death toll stood at 14, and
40 had been hospitalized for injuries, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudoviye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in the southern city of Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers
(850 miles) south of Moscow.
	   The cause of the accident was not immediately known, Beltsov
said.
	   Many of Russia's public buildings are in poor repair since
government funding for state facilities all but disappeared after
the Soviet collapse.

Sri Lanka stops sponsoring foreign television promotions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka has stopped sponsoring
foreign television coverage of its tourism industry after a German
film depicted this island nation as a sex haven for single women,
officials said Thursday.
	   In the past six months, the Ceylon Tourism Board invited six TV
crews to promote tourism, paid from its dlrs 3.5 million budget.
The crews usually were escorted, but Sri Lankan officials did not
interfere with the shooting or scripting.
	   For the conservative Sri Lankans, the campaign appeared to
backfire when a film showing European women in suggestive
situations with Sri Lankan men was repeatedly shown on a German
cable channel.
	   The decision to end the promotion would not affect news coverage
by foreign television teams visiting Sri Lanka on their own, said
the officials on condition of anonymity. Sri Lanka has been wracked
by ethnic war since 1983.
	   Sri Lanka already is fighting an image as a playground for men
seeking sex with boys. Last year, the government raised the maximum
prison terms for pedophiles to 20 years, and private groups are
campaigning against child sex tourism.
	   Germans comprised the largest nationality among the 366,000
tourists to visit Sri Lanka last year, followed by the French and
British.

Chirac launches new Africa policy with trip to southern Africa

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac set
foot for the first time in southern Africa on Thursday,
establishing an economic and political beachhead that is key to
France's new African policy.
	   President Sam Nujoma, 69, greeted Chirac who landed just as the
winter sun got high enough to burn off the morning chill.
	   ``You see those mountains, they are full of uranium, copper and
oil. We need the French geologists to help develop them,'' Nujoma
told journalists shortly before Chirac's plane touched down.
	   Chirac is making a one-day visit to this capital, 360 kilometers
(223 miles) inland from the continent's southwest Atlantic
coastline.
	   With his arrival amidst the wheat colored mountains and thorn
acacia plains surrounding the capital city, Chirac began a six-day
trip that will also take him to South Africa, Mozambique and
Angola.
	   The tour comes less than a year after France launched major
changes in its Africa policies away from involvement in her former
West African colonies.
	   Chirac told reporters at Statehouse, where he conferred with
Nujoma, historically French involvement in Africa was centered on
its former colonies.
	   ``But now France wants to open itself and create new
partnerships with southern African countries,'' said Chirac.
	   Close relations with post-apartheid South Africa, the dominant
nation of the region, play a central role in the new orientation.
	   Commercial and economic interests appear to dominate the move,
but France also wants to hedge increasing U.S. influence in Africa.
	   France has been criticized for propping up dictators in
countries like the former Zaire and Rwanda, and the new policy
calls for reducing the number of French troops and helping instead
to train African peacekeeping forces.
	   Like U.S. President Bill Clinton when he visited Africa earlier
this year, Chirac is traveling with top business people to explore
investment and trade opportunities.
	   ``France wants to offer these countries an opportunity to extend
their horizon,'' said presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna at
a Paris briefing before the trip.
	   Chirac's stops in Namibia, Angola and Mozambique are the first
visits ever by a French president. The late President Francois
Mitterrand visited South Africa soon after Nelson Mandela was
elected president in 1994.
	   Nujoma was elected in Namibia's first democratic elections in
1989. Before that, Nujoma was in exile for 30 years when South
Africa ruled the territory that is larger than Texas and Louisiana
combined, or one and a half times the size of France.
	   Also on the Namibian itinerary is a visit to a school in
Katutura, a black township where 30,000 Namibians were forced to
live after being uprooted from their homes in 1958 under apartheid
rule.
	   Namibia was hailed as a model of democracy when it broke away
from South Africa. But now the semi-arid country of 1.6 million
people is edging toward one-party rule by the South West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO) that waged the bush war against South
Africa.
	   Economic growth has fallen from 7.6 percent in 1992 to 2.6
percent in 1996 in this diamond and mineral-rich country.

Police arrest two teens in connection with synagogue ransacking 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Two teen-agers have been detained in
the northwestern city of Oradea for allegedly ransacking a
synagogue and painting profane symbols on the walls, police said
Friday.
	   Last week, the two 17-year-olds allegedly daubed the walls of
the Zion synagogue with slogans such as ``Le Diablo'' and profaned
the star of David with the figure 666, said to be Satan's number in
the Bible.
	   They smashed synagogue windows and destroyed nine wooden
benches, two prayer desks and eight commemorative plaques in the
synagogue, some 450 kilometers (280 miles) northwest of Bucharest.
	   They also made off with candelabras and copper artifacts, said
police Col. Gheorghe Tudor.
	   Damage was estimated at millions of lei (thousands of dollars).
The two, who have a criminal record of break-ins, were drunk and
were not suspected of belonging to any Satanic sect.
	   Fascist leaders unleashed a reign of terror on Romania's 800,000
Jews during World War II. Half their number survived and most
emigrated to Israel during Romania's communist period, leaving a
population of some 14,000 mainly elderly Jews today.
	   In World War II, tens of thousands of Jews in northwest Romania
were deported to concentration camps in regions controlled by
Hungary. Most of them died.
	   Only two of 29 synagogues in Oradea are in use.

Two Israelis killed, four wounded in south Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Israel confirming casualties; TRIMS
By AHMED MANTASH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas attacked Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon early Thursday, killing two soldiers and
wounding four, officials said.
	   In retaliation, Israeli helicopters strafed guerrilla
infiltration trails with machine guns, and ground guns fired 15
mortar bombs and about 40 shells of 155 mm caliber, the officials
said. There was no word on casualties.
	   The attack came as preparations were underway to return the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed in South Lebanon last year in
exchange for bodies of Lebanese guerrillas and prisoners held by
Israel.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah said in a statement that its
fighters detonated two bomb within a space of 15 minutes near an
Israeli patrol and raked the area with ``appropriate weapons'' as
reinforcements arrived at the scene.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the two slain
soldiers were on a patrol traveling to military exercises. Three of
four wounded soldiers were in serious condition, he said.
	   The attack occurred near Houla, 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) from the
Israeli border and about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southeast of
Sidon, provincial capital of South Lebanon. Large parts of the area
are occupied by Israel and Hezbollah and other militias are
fighting to evict Israeli soldiers.
	   Timur Goksel, a spokesman for a United Nations peacekeeping
force in southern Lebanon, reported heavy firing from both sides
involving mortars, machine guns and big jeep-mounted rifles capable
of knocking out tanks.
	   The incident is unlikely to affect the prisoner and body
exchange, which was agreed upon after 10 months of tortuous
negotiations involving the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
	   Thursday's fatalities raised to eight killed and 66 wounded the
number of Israeli losses in southern Lebanon this year.
	   In 1997, 39 Israeli soldiers were killed in guerrilla attacks, a
record annual figure since 1985 when Israel declared the occupied
area a security zone meant to protect its northern towns from
guerrilla attacks.
	   Among last year's dead were 12 soldiers killed in a botched
commando raid on Sept. 5. The Israelis recovered all except one
body _ that of Sgt. Itamar Ilya whose remains are at the crux of
the imminent swap.
	   News reports in Lebanon and Israel have said that Ilya's remains
will be returned home later Thursday and Israel will hand over the
bodies of 40 guerrillas and release more than 60 prisoners.
	   Some of the prisoners are held in Israel but most are detained
in the occupied zone in the south.

Three convicted murderers hanged in Japan 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three convicted murderers were hanged Thursday in
Japan's first executions in nearly a year, news media reported.
	   Although executions require an order from the justice minister,
officials at the ministry always refuse to confirm or comment on
them.
	   Japan has now executed 28 criminals since 1993, when the death
penalty was resumed after more than three years of suspension, said
the media reports, citing informed sources that they did not name.
	   In the last previous executions, four people were hanged last
August, the reports said.
	   They said Shinji Shimazu, 66, was hanged at a Tokyo prison. He
had been sentenced to death for a murder and robbery in 1983 while
on parole from a life sentence in another murder-robbery case, the
reports added.
	   Two others were executed at a prison in Fukuoka, southwestern
Japan, they said.
	   Masahiro Muratake, 54, was convicted of killing his wife and two
other people in 1978, and Yukihisa Takeyasu, 66, murdered a woman
in 1980 while he was on parole from a sentence for another murder
committed in 1956, the reports said.
	   Though executions are never publicly announced, relatives and
lawyers can confirm a convict's fate later by checking whether the
person's name has been crossed off registration lists at government
offices.

	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A bomb attack on Thursday believed
carried out by the Basque separatist group ETA killed a governing
party councilor in this northern town, national Spanish radio
reported.
	   Manuel Zamarreno of the Popular Party died after a vehicle
carrying a bomb hit his car and exploded shortly after 11 a.m.
(0900 GMT), the radio reported. Zamarreno's bodyguard was injured,
the radio said.
	   If the bombing is confirmed as an ETA attack, Zamarreno would be
the sixth victim of the militant Basque group so far this year.
	   Zamarreno replaced Jose Luis Caso in the Renteria town council
last month. Caso was shot dead by an ETA gunman in a bar on Dec.
11.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed nearly 800 people since launching its campaign for an
independent Basque state in 1968.

Philippine stocks, peso fall on continuing Japanese woes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with peso lower at close of trading
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks closed lower
Thursday after uneasy investors took advantage of early gains to
take profits.
	   The peso continued to weaken along with other Asian currencies,
which slumped as a result of the weak Japanese yen, dealers said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index dropped 3.85
points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,709.03 after gaining 17.02 points
Wednesday.
	   Losers outnumbered gainers 57 to 37, with 38 issues unchanged.
	   Lingering concerns over the volatile currency market and
prospects of higher inflation and interest rates prompted stock
investors to cash in on gains at the slightest opportunity,
analysts said.
	   ``Uncertainty still clouds the region, while political
controversies are hounding the local scene,'' said Nestor Aguila,
president of Market Capital and Securities Inc.
	   Hansley Lee, analyst for Abacus Securities Corp., said the
market is seeking its correct valuation given current economic
realities.
	   It appears, he said, that an economic recovery won't come as
fast as initially expected because of the possible repercussions of
a further slowdown in the Japanese economy.
	   ``A lot of stocks, even those that are fundamentally sound, are
being dragged down by fears over the prospects of the economy,''
Lee said.
	   Securities 2000 Inc. analyst Erwin Balita said many investors
are holding back, fearful that the market will retest the lows hit
early this year on the possibility of higher interest rates.
	   In January, the main index hit a record low of 1,518.
	   ``Interest rates can't stay where they are now given a volatile
currency and the likelihood of inflation hitting around 12
percent,'' Balita said.
	   The central bank's overnight borrowing and lending rates are
currently 13.125 percent and 15.125 percent, respectively.
	   Higher interest rates tend to make fixed income investments more
attractive than stocks.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 41.503 pesos at the end
of Thursday's trading, up from Wednesday's average of 41.443 pesos.
The dollar was last traded at 41.515 pesos.
	   Volume declined to dlrs 78.1 million from dlrs 127 million
Wednesday.
	   ``The peso continues to move in tandem with the other regional
currencies, which are getting direction from the yen,'' one trader
said.
	   Traders noted that concerns over Japan's weakening economy are
expected to continue to affect the peso for weeks.
	   Mild demand for dollars, coupled with sufficient supply of the
U.S. currency, prevented the peso from depreciating further,
however, traders said.

Town councilor killed by bomb believed placed by Basque separatists of victim in car, ADDS details attack, background on ETA targets 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
Eds: UPDATES with confirmation of attack, CORRECTS initial reports
<TEXT>
	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A governing party politician was killed
Thursday in an attack believed to have been carried out by the
armed Basque separatist group ETA, six months after his predecessor
was shot dead by a masked ETA gunman, authorities said.
	   Manuel Zamarreno, a Popular Party councilor in this northern
Basque town, died from injuries caused by a bomb apparently planted
in a motorcycle parked on a street corner, an interior ministry
spokesman said.
	   The bomb exploded when the councilor and his bodyguard walked by
shortly after 11 a.m. (0900GMT), the spokesman said. The bodyguard
was also injured, but his life was not in danger.
	   Zamarreno replaced Jose Luis Caso in the Renteria town council
last month. Caso was shot dead in a bar by an ETA gunman on Dec.
11. Both men's lives had been threatened in graffiti.
	   A third Popular Party councilor from the same town, Concepcion
Gironza, resigned in April when the pressure of being a potential
ETA target became too much.
	   If proved to be the work of ETA, Zamarreno will be the group's
sixth victim in 1998 and the sixth town councilor linked to the
Popular Party killed over the last year.
	   Governing party councilors have become ETA's preferred victims
in apparent retaliation for the hard anti-ETA line taken by the
conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   Most of the 800 people killed by ETA during its 30-year campaign
for an independent Basque state have belonged to the security
forces. The groups name is a Basque language acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Landslides and floods caused by heavy summer
rains have killed at least 160 people and injured more than 119
others in three southern Chinese provinces, state media reported.
	   More than 60 other people were still missing following the
landslides Monday in Jiangxi and Zhejiang and the severe flooding
in Fujian, the reports said.
	   The scenic southern city of Guilin, where U.S. President Bill
Clinton is due to visit next Thursday, also is suffering its worst
floods in nearly 50 years, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said in
a report late Wednesday.
	   In the past two days, rains have stopped and the waters have
been receding, leaving some damage in the city but ``no big
problems,'' Doji Cering, the minister of civil affairs, said at a
briefing.
	   The Li River, which flows through the city and the haystack-like
peaks of the region, is ``not so pretty as usual'' because its
waters are so high, he said.
	   At least 43 villagers were buried alive in massive landslides in
a hilly region in Jiangxi's Lichuan County, Xinhua said. More than
100 people were injured and more than 20 others were missing, it
said. The landslides also destroyed 500 houses.
	   Floods in neighboring Zhejiang province have devastated 25
cities and towns and killed 48 people, Xinhua said. More than
11,000 houses have been damaged and 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres)
of rice paddies flooded, it said.
	   A landslide in the Zhejiang village of Xinjian followed heavy
rainstorms that destroyed 14 houses and left 151 people homeless.
The landslide killed 17 people, injured 19, and left 6 missing,
Xinhua said.
	   The village in the southern part of Zhejiang, on China's eastern
seaboard, has been hit by rains since June 12, the heaviest
downpour of its kind in five decades, Xinhua said.
	   Severe floods have killed 44 people and left another 34 missing
in Fuzhou, capital of southeastern Fujian province, the China Daily
said Thursday. The floods have damaged more than 60,000 buildings,
leaving 20,000 people homeless, the official newspaper said.
	   An additional eight people have been killed by flooding in
Jiangxi as major rivers reached or surpassed flood warning levels,
the newspaper said. Roads and electricity and telephone lines were
damaged, and more than 150,000 houses destroyed, it said.
	   The floods, caused by torrential rains since mid-June, are the
heaviest to hit the two provinces this century, the newspaper said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A balcony holding more than 100 spectators
collapsed Thursday onto the crowded floor of a sports stadium in
southern Russia, killing at least 16 people, officials said.
Twenty-three others were injured.
	   The accident occurred about 11:40 a.m. (0740 GMT) during the
Russian national wrestling competition, when a 50-meter-long
(160-foot-long) balcony fell onto the spectators underneath, said
Col. Alik Betrozov of the local branch of Russia's Emergencies
Ministry.
	   Rescue workers were trying to locate additional victims who may
be trapped beneath the debris. An estimated 500 people were sitting
underneath the balcony at the time of the accident, he said.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in the southern city of Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers
(850 miles) south of Moscow.
	   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
	   Many of Russia's public buildings are in poor repair since
government funding for state facilities all but disappeared after
the Soviet collapse.

	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ President Clinton came to China on Thursday
to pursue at the summit, at village roundtables, with communists
and with stockbrokers the East-West relationship he calls vital to
peace and stability in the 21st Century.
	   Air Force One touched down in sweltering Xi'an, where crowds of
evening onlookers lined the streets along his route. Security was
stringent; Chinese authorities stationed water cannons in side
streets nearby.
	   The extravagant ceremonial welcome at the South Gate of the Old
City began a presidential mission disputed at home, a sendoff
marred by formal diplomatic protest after China barred three radio
reporters for Radio Free Asia, a U.S. government broadcaster
nettling to Beijing.
	   During the long journey to China, Clinton said he will be
striving for the advancement of political and human rights, an
issue rankling a Congress divided over his policy of cordial
engagement and investigating his prior deals with Beijing.

Insurgency leaves 18 militants and five civilians dead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Security forces killed 18 Muslim
militants and five civilians were slain in some of the latest
violence in a 6-year-old insurgency, according to reports Thursday.
	   Meanwhile, a bomb exploded in an Algiers cafe Thursday morning,
causing one slight injury, French television station LCI reported.
	   The 18 militants were killed Wednesday by security forces near
the village of Sidi Lantri, 250 kms (150 miles) southwest of the
capital, said an official statement.
	   Authorities seized a large amount of arms and ammunition after
the clash, the statement said. As is customary in the insurgency,
officials gave no casualty figure among their own forces.
	   The slain militants were believed to have massacred 14 people
from two families that refused to give money, said villagers
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Four villagers were killed overnight Tuesday in Sidi Salerm,
near the mountain town of Medea about 100 kms (60 miles) south of
Algiers, the independent daily Liberte reported.
	   A member of a local government-backed ``self-defense'' militia
was shot and killed Wednesday in Sebdou, near the western town of
Tlemcen on the Moroccan border, the newspaper said.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government
scrapped second-round parliamentary elections in January 1992. The
Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win the balloting on voter
discontent with corruption and high unemployment in this
petroleum-rich North African nation.

U.S.-led panel: progress on 2,360 WWII accounts in Swiss banks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ More than 2,360 claims to dormant
Holocaust-era accounts in Swiss banks are ready to be judged by a
tribunal, according to a U.S.-led panel.
	   They are among some 15,000 claims filed so far on the millions
of dollars in dormant accounts published last year by Swiss banks,
said a statement issued Wednesday in New York by the Independent
Committee of Eminent Persons.
	   The panel, headed by former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, didn't say how many claims had been rejected or still
awaited initial review.
	   The panel, which met in New York to check progress on the
claims, said the tribunal hopes experience gained since the
beginning of the year will help it speed up decisions.
	   Once claimants have cleared the first hurdle of receiving
approval for a tribunal review, they learn account details and
advance to a final ruling.
	   The arbitrators are using ``relaxed standards of proof'' to give
the benefit of the doubt to claimants who lack details about their
relatives' accounts.
	   But, the statement said, the tribunal ``reaches decisions only
after a careful assessment of all available facts.''
	   The investigation benefits from ``the extensive record of
accounts ... that is still available after more than 50 years,'' it
said.
	   The statement didn't say how much money was in the accounts, but
Swiss banks say they have found about 67 million Swiss francs (dlrs
46 million) in accounts unclaimed since World War II.
	   In April the panel said the tribunal had approved payouts
totaling some 2 million francs (dlrs 1.38 million) in 13 cases.
	   The committee, whose members were appointed by Swiss banks and
Jewish organizations, is supervising a complete examination of all
banks which were operating during World War II.
	   The deadline for submitting claims on the dormant accounts
published last year is the end of this month.
	   The committee said that so far, the most claims have been
submitted from the United States, 1,918. Israel has submitted
1,138, Germany 1,095 and France 1,011.
	   A major ``investigative challenge'' in the search for Holocaust
accounts is the lack of information on refugee accounts that may
have been closed and therefore were not included among dormant
accounts.
	   To help in the search, the committee is compiling all the
information it can from the banks and comparing it with data on
non-Swiss who may have opened accounts in Switzerland before being
killed by the Nazis.
	   Some 5,570 of the names on the published accounts were
non-Swiss.

Sara Lee donates Pissarro painting to Lyon museum 
</HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - A provincial museum that snapped up Impressionist
art long before it was famous and pricey is being given Camille
Pissarro's ``Le Pont Neuf'' by the U.S.-based multinational Sara
Lee Corp.
	   The gift to Lyon's Museum of Fine Arts from one of America's
finest corporate collections is part of the company's program to
donate dozens of paintings to U.S. and foreign museums.
	   ``Le Pont Neuf,'' depicting a busy winter traffic scene on
Paris' oldest bridge over the Seine, is one of a series of the
bridge dating from 1902-1903, the year Pissarro died.
	   ``We are overjoyed and completely stunned to receive this
donation,'' head curator Philippe Durey said.
	   Known as ``the little Louvre,'' the provincial museum in
France's second largest city houses a vast collection ranging from
Egyptian mummies to contemporary sculpture.
	   ``Lyon was the first French museum to buy Impressionist
paintings -- back in 1901,'' Durey said in a telephone interview.
``No one was interested in Paul Gauguin and we bought our first one
in 1912.''
	   Set in a former 17th century Benedictine abbey, the museum was
recently overhauled at a cost of 400 million francs (dlrs 66.6
million).
	   Sarah Lee's so-called ``Millenium Program'' was designed to give
works to museums that couldn't afford to purchase them, said
Laurence Duffort-Fouqueil, a spokeswoman for the conglomerate that
includes food, clothing textiles and cleaning products.
	   Earlier this month Sara Lee announced it was donating 35
Impressionist masterpieces worth dlrs 100 million to 28 American
museums.
	   The art also could translate into a big tax break for Sara Lee
when it is officially donated in the year 2000. The company is
expected to take a tax writeoff for the fair market value of the
paintings that it would not have received had the items been sold.
	   Lyon is one of only five foreign museums slated to receive
works. The company said it chose museums where it has major
commercial interests.
	   Most of the works come from the personal collection of the late
Nathan Cummings, a philanthropist and chairman of Consolidated
Foods Corp., which eventually became Sara Lee.
	   The collection, including works by Henri Matisse, Edgar Degas,
Paul Gauguin and Pissarro, long graced the corporation's Chicago
offices.

	   Regarding the controversy over technology exports, Beijing's
foreign ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said Thursday that
cooperation on satellite launches ``benefits both sides. Those who
are in the mainstream of bilateral relations should have a correct
view.''
	   Tang dismissed U.S. investigations as ``a wave of noise in the
United States that is intended to obstruct the development of
bilateral relations with the United States. We believe it by no
means represents the attitude of most American people.''
	   Clinton views his nine-day mission to China, first by an
American president since George Bush in February 1989, as the right
way to increase America's impact on human rights, nuclear weapons
spread and for cooperation with Beijing to stabilize shaken Asian
economies.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' the president
said at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, where Air Force One
stopped to refuel.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' he told about 4,000 people
who turned out to see him on his way.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ President Clinton came to China Thursday to
pursue at the summit, at village roundtables, with communists and
with stockbrokers the East-West relationship he calls vital to
peace and stability in the 21st Century. The extravagant ceremonial
welcome at the South Gate of the Old City began a presidential
mission disputed at home, a sendoff marred by formal diplomatic
protest after China barred three radio reporters for Radio Free
Asia, a U.S. government broadcaster nettling to Beijing.During the
long journey to China, Clinton said he will be striving for the
advancement of political and human rights, an issue rankling a
Congress divided over his policy of cordial engagement and
investigating his prior deals with Beijing.
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Despite fears that the result is
stacked in favor of strongman Hun Sen, the campaign for Cambodia's
elections officially opened Thursday with thousands of people
welcoming the main candidates in separate rallies. The polls July
26 will be Cambodia's first since 1993, when U.N. peacekeeping
troops were part of a dlrs 2 billion effort to usher in a new era
of peace and democracy after the Khmer Rouge genocide of the late
1970s, followed by Vietnamese occupation. Hun Sen _ who toppled the
co-premier he had ruled with since 1993, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
in a bloody coup last year _ holds most of the cards.
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After declaring again that Serb
forces must ``get out'' of Kosovo, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
began a hectic round of talks Thursday aimed at stopping the
fighting in the Yugoslav province. Trying to head off the need for
threatened NATO intervention in Kosovo, Holbrooke sat down with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for the second time in three
days, Yugoslav media said. Later, he was to meet with a Russian
envoy before heading back to Kosovo to talk with ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova in the provincial capital Pristina on
Thursday night or Friday.
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former first lady Imelda Marcos
backed off Thursday from a plan to bury her husband, dictator
Ferdinand Marcos, in a heroes' cemetery because of widespread
opposition that threatened the popularity of the Philippines'
president-elect. The emotion-charged dispute over whether Marcos
should be buried at Heroes' Cemetery in metropolitan Manila nearly
nine years after dying in exile in 1989 has reopened old wounds and
divided Filipinos. President-elect Joseph Estrada, a former Marcos
supporter who takes office June 30, told reporters Thursday he was
surprised at the extent of the opposition, which had eroded the
massive popular support he received in last month's elections.
	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A governing party politician was killed
Thursday in an attack believed to have been carried out by the
armed Basque separatist group ETA, six months after his predecessor
was shot dead by a masked ETA gunman, authorities said. Manuel
Zamarreno, a Popular Party councilor in this northern Basque town,
died from injuries caused by a bomb apparently planted in a
motorcycle parked on a street corner, an interior ministry
spokesman said. Zamarreno replaced Jose Luis Caso in the Renteria
town council last month. Caso was shot dead in a bar by an ETA
gunman on Dec. 11. Both men's lives had been threatened in
graffiti.

XI'AN: his way. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   But even as Clinton flew to China, police arrested two
dissidents in a display of Beijing's hard line against
pro-democracy activists.
	   Clinton's first stop Thursday was Xi'an for an elaborate
welcoming in the ancient walled capital, pageantry dating from
dynasties that flourished a millennium before the first American
colonies. The gritty industrial city surrounding it now was
primped, painted and flag-decked for Clinton's arrival.
	   On Friday, Clinton goes to the village of Xia He for what is
billed as a roundtable discussion with ordinary Chinese citizens
about their lives in a changing society. He'll speak in the village
square. Then Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, are
tourists for an afternoon, visiting the unearthed terra cotta
warriors, pottery soldiers fashioned to guard an emperor in the
afterlife.
	   Then to Beijing on Saturday, opening with the event that has
stirred the greatest controversy at home: a formal welcoming in
Tiananmen Square, scene of the democracy demonstrations bloodily
repressed by Chinese troops in June 1989.
	   Clinton defends his decision to go to that symbolic site as
protocol, not substance, and said he will speak America's piece for
human rights and freedom. But not there; no speeches at Tiananmen.
	   The president said it would be wrong for him to demand that the
Chinese change the way they welcome world leaders to Beijing, but
``equally wrong for me to go there and take no notice of the
continuing difficulties with human and political rights.''
	   So he said he will do both, the latter, probably, in an address
at Beijing University on Monday.
	   Critics at home, however, kept up the pressure. The House voted
late Wednesday to include in a dlrs 250 billion defense spending
bill a provision that would bar the Pentagon from buying any
product manufactured by the Chinese government or its army.
	   Separately, a senior Pentagon adviser, Peter Leitner, said he
believed business interests had been allowed to override national
security concerns in deals with China.
	   The weekend is the actual summit with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, the joint meetings of U.S. and Chinese officials and the
state banquet at the Great Hall of the People. Clinton and Jiang
are to dine privately Sunday evening.
	   But ceremonies and state visits did not shroud the discordant
notes of U.S.-China relationships. That was dramatized when the
Chinese canceled visas for three reporters of Radio Free Asia, a
U.S.-financed operation that beams broadcasts here, jammed by the
Beijing government.
	   Clinton countered by granting the three a White House interview,
saying the Chinese government made a big mistake, and that ideas do
not need visas. He said he supported Radio Free Asia, not against
the Chinese government but for the advancement of freedom of speech
and debate.
	   Rebuking Beijing, Clinton also disputed his critics, saying they
complain that his journey is more symbolism than substance _ but
that they want him to make it even more symbolic by snubbing
protocol and by seeking out dissidents even though steps like those
could be counterproductive.
	   ``This is a difficult trip because of the differences between
us, but it's also an important trip because of our common interests
and because so much is at stake,'' Clinton said. ``The chances of
doing good for the American people and for the stability of the
world far outweigh dealing with the difficulties.''
	   He said that validates a policy of ``continued, disciplined
engagement.''

German border guards stop 14 suspected hooligans en route to World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Beefed-up patrols of German border guards
had stopped more than 10,000 travelers by noon Thursday and
detained 14 suspected hooligans in their push to prevent violence
at World Cup matches in France.
	   The suspected hooligans had their passports taken away.
	   The Interior Ministry, which announced the arrests, posted 1,000
extra border guards on Wednesday as a precaution against violence
during Thursday night's game between Germany and Iran in
Montpellier, France.
	   Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel will attend the match.
	   The border checks come after 180 German thugs clashed with
French police on Sunday during the Germany-Yugoslavia game. A
police officer was beaten comatose.
	   French authorities placed Markus Warnecke, 27, of Hanover, and
Steffen Karl Elschner, 26, of Braunschweig, under formal
investigation Tuesday night in connection with the beating. Formal
investigation is one step short of being charged.

Magomedov re-elected leader of Russia's Dagestan

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The parliament in Russia's southern republic of
Dagestan re-elected Magomedali Magomedov on Thursday as leader of
this restive Caucasus region, a news report said.
	   Magomedov received 162 votes in the 242-seat legislature to be
re-elected chairman of Dagestan's State Council. Challenger
Sharafutdin Musayev, head of Dagestan's Pension Fund, got 78 votes,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Interfax said the re-election was held in a tense atmosphere,
with many fearing conflict between Dagestan's many ethnic groups.
	   Unrest has increased recently in Dagestan, a poverty-stricken
and crime-ridden republic near the breakaway region of Chechnya.
Ethnic rivalry and unemployment affecting 90 percent of adult males
were both factors.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed slightly higher
Wednesday as investors waited for details of government measures to
boost Japan's financial sector. Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average gained 68.58 points, or 0.46 percent, closing at 15,123.18.
On Tuesday, the average had plunged 254.49 points, or 1.66 percent.
The Nikkei average was up some 150 points at one point, but shed
some of its gains as investors were discouraged by the yen's
weakening in the afternoon and were still waiting for government
initiatives to revive the financial sector. The U.S. dollar climbed
to a midday high of 141.18 yen, its highest level since last
Wednesday, when the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve
joined forces to prop up the yen. The dollar later retreated to
140.36 yen in late Tokyo trading, up 2.61 yen from late Tuesday.
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC said Thursday it will drastically
slash oil output, hoping to undo the damage it did to prices by an
ill-judged decision to start pumping more crude last winter. World
oil supplies are now so glutted that OPEC acknowledged its plan to
withdraw some 1.355 million barrels a day from the market is not
likely to have an immediate impact. Brent crude oil to be delivered
in August fell 15 cents to dlrs 13.46 per barrel by late Thursday
morning on London's International Petroleum. E xchange.Traders were
skeptical about whether OPEC will deliver on its latest promises,
and it likely will be about six weeks before they get initial
indications about whether all the promised production cuts are
real.
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Worried that deepening economic pain
could fuel fresh riots, Indonesia and the International Monetary
Fund on Thursday announced a revised bailout deal loaded with fuel
and food subsidies for millions of poor people. The agreement opens
the way for the resumption of a dlrs 43 billion IMF-led rescue
package, badly needed to heal an economy expected to shrink by more
than 10 percent this year. Hubert Neiss, the IMF's senior official
in Asia, said even more international aid might be needed to
supplement the bailout. Directors of the 182-nation lending agency
are expected to approve the disbursement of new loans to Indonesia
at a meeting next month at their Washington headquarters.
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The sudden installation of his top
economic adviser in a Cabinet-level post was not a political shove
to his finance minister, Malaysia's prime minister said Thursday.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Wednesday appointed his close
confidant, Daim Zainuddin, to the new, vaguely worded post of
Special Functions Minister. Mahathir said Daim's new position was
designed to bolster the National Economic Action Council, a
government task force headed by Daim to examine the slump that saw
the economy shrink by 1.8 percent in the first quarter of the year.
Analysts widely interpreted the move as a way to shift power away
from Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim, whose policies have conflicted
with Mahathir's prescriptions for the economic slump.
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's opposition-dominated parliament decided
Thursday to delay consideration of a package of emergency economic
measures until next week despite Kremlin pressure for speedy
approval. The measures are needed to put into action a new
budget-cutting, revenue-raising plan designed to win new lending
from the International Monetary Fund. Russia's financial markets
have been falling for weeks, with investors worried over the Asian
crisis, plummeting oil prices and the possibility of social unrest
in Russia. The fund is to decide later Thursday whether to release
a delayed dlrs 670 installment of an existing loan. A decision on
Russia's request for a new dlrs 10-15 billion loan is expected to
take several weeks.

Town councilor killed by bomb believed placed by Basque separatists CORRECTS initial reports of victim in car 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with confirmation, details of attack, background;
<TEXT>
	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A governing party politician was killed
Thursday in an attack believed to have been carried out by the
armed Basque separatist group ETA, six months after his predecessor
was shot dead by a masked ETA gunman, authorities said.
	   Manuel Zamarreno, a Popular Party councilor in this northern
Basque town, died from injuries caused by a bomb apparently planted
in a motorcycle parked on a street corner, an interior ministry
spokesman said.
	   The bomb exploded when the councilor and his bodyguard walked by
shortly after 11 a.m. (0900GMT), the spokesman said. The bodyguard
was also injured, but his life was not in danger.
	   Zamarreno replaced Jose Luis Caso in the Renteria town council
last month. Caso was shot dead in a bar by an ETA gunman on Dec.
11. Both men's lives had been threatened in graffiti.
	   A third Popular Party councilor from the same town, Concepcion
Gironza, resigned in April when the pressure of being a potential
ETA target became too much.
	   Zamarreno would be the group's sixth victim in 1998 and the
sixth town councilor linked to the Popular Party killed over the
last year.
	   Governing party councilors have become ETA's preferred victims
in apparent retaliation for the hard anti-ETA line taken by the
conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   Most of the 800 people killed by ETA during its 30-year campaign
for an independent Basque state have belonged to the security
forces. The groups name is a Basque language acronym for Basque
Homeland and Freedom.

Northern Ireland voters go to polls with bomb attack fresh in mind

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's people voted
Thursday to elect a new government that, if it works, will bring
both sides of this long-divided society together as never before.
	   And even as 1.17 million eligible voters were being given the
chance to implement this key plank of the Belfast peace agreement,
the Irish Catholics and British Protestants of one shattered
village were already working together _ picking their way through a
familiar sea of rubble and glass shards following a bombing.
	   Wednesday's car bomb in Newtownhamilton wounded a 13-year-old
boy, wrecked shops and roofs, tore iron walls off of a fortified
police barracks _ the supposed target _ and forced authorities to
move polling booths away from the devastation.
	   ``This might make people more determined to vote, but the people
I've been talking to feel very down, very depressed that this
should happen again,'' said Conor Murphy, watching a trickle of
voters come and go at the relocated polling station in
Newtownhamilton High School.
	   Murphy is the local candidate for the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, which would traditionally defend such bombings as necessary
to expel British forces from Northern Ireland. But Wednesday's
attack was claimed by the Irish National Liberation Army, an
anti-British gang opposed to the larger Irish Republican Army's
11-month-old truce.
	   Ballots will be counted all day Friday and possibly into
Saturday to determine how many seats each party will hold in the
new 108-member Assembly. More than a dozen parties and independents
are fielding 296 candidates.
	   Police in flak jackets stood guard at the more than 1,200
polling stations across Northern Ireland.
	   Activists from several parties also kept watch _ in hopes of
identifying supporters of rival parties using fake identification
or false addresses to cast several votes, a chronic problem in
elections here.
	   The outcome will do much to determine whether the peace
agreement, struck in April among eight parties after 22 months of
negotiations, will succeed or unravel.
	   One of the Assembly's basic tasks will be to select a 12-member
administration of Protestants and Catholics that oversees
government departments and cooperates formally with the Irish
Republic. Like other controversial decisions, majorities of both
Protestant and Catholic members will be required to approve these
appointments.
	   Leaders of the largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists,
back the agreement and are predicting they'll win the most seats.
But two other Protestant parties that boycotted the talks because
of Sinn Fein's involvement are hoping to win enough seats to stymie
the necessary voting consensus.
	   While the agreement was easily ratified in referendums in both
parts of Ireland on May 22, the 29 percent ``no'' vote registered
in Northern Ireland came almost entirely from Protestants, who
constitute some 55 percent of the population.
	   Protestant hard-liners take inspiration from the fate of
Northern Ireland's only previous attempt to share power between
moderate Protestants and Catholics. That cross-community
administration in 1974 soon crumbled in the face of a Protestant
general strike and unrelenting IRA violence.
	   But one important difference this time is that Northern
Ireland's two major pro-British gangs, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, support the agreement and
are working hard to get their political spokesmen elected to the
Assembly.
	   In Belfast the UDA-linked Ulster Democratic Party assembled a
fleet of five vans and scores of cars to transport potential
supporters to the voting booths in working-class Protestant areas.
	   ``They all say they're voting for our man,'' said Matt Kinkaid,
a campaigner for Ulster Democrats candidate John White, who 25
years ago to the day stabbed a Catholic politician and his
girlfriend to death. ``But you never know what they actually do in
the privacy of the voting booth.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A balcony holding more than 100 spectators
collapsed Thursday onto the crowded floor of a sports stadium in
southern Russia, killing at least 16 people, officials said.
Twenty-three others were injured.
	   The accident occurred about 11:40 a.m. (0740 GMT) during the
Russian national wrestling competition, when a 50-meter-long
(160-foot-long) balcony fell about 5 meters (16 feet) onto the
spectators underneath, said Col. Alik Betrozov of the local branch
of Russia's Emergencies Ministry.
	   Rescue workers were trying to locate additional victims who may
be trapped beneath the debris.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in the southern city of Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers
(850 miles) south of Moscow.
	   A stadium official who declined to give his name said faulty
construction was suspected to have caused the accident. He said
about 3,000 spectators were in the stadium at the time of the
collapse.
	   Shoddy construction is endemic in Russia, where funds for
construction and maintenance of public buildings have all but
disappeared since the Soviet collapse.

China accuses Japan of sinking protest boat near disputed islands 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China said Thursday that Japan ``should be held
responsible'' for damaging a ship that was carrying Hong Kong
residents protesting Tokyo's control over disputed islands.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said China had warned
Japan not to intensify the conflict over the Diaoyu Islands, which
are claimed by both countries.
	   ``It is regrettable that Japanese authorities sent many ships
and that one hit and sank a ship. China is very concerned. Japan
should be held responsible,'' Tang said in a regular news briefing.
	   Japan's coast guard said, however, the ship still was drifting
in the area of the islands, watched by a Japanese patrol boat. It
was in no immediate danger of sinking, and had not been damaged
along its waterline when hit by a patrol boat escorting it out of
Japanese waters, the agency said.
	   It had reported earlier that the 100-ton trawler, one of six
vessels from Taiwan and Hong Kong, was abandoned Wednesday after
its occupants reported a leak.
	   On Thursday, it said in a statement that Japanese officials
searched the ship and found the leak was in rubber tubing in the
engine's cooling system.
	   It was impossible to believe this damage had been caused by a
bump from a Japanese ship, the agency said.
	   It said, however, that in the escort action, the Hong Kong ship
suffered holes, each smaller than two square meters (20 square
feet), in structures above the deck.
	   All but one of the 25 activists and crew members from the
trawler Diaoyutai went aboard other ships from Taiwan. A Japanese
patrol boat picked up the remaining one.
	   The activists flew back to Hong Kong Thursday. Albert Ho, the
expedition's leader, said Japan attacked them ``in the most
reckless and unscrupulous manner.'' He called on Taiwan and China
to negotiate with Japan.
	   The protesters were making the latest in a series of efforts to
land on the uninhabited, Japanese-controlled islands _ known as
Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese _ to dramatize claims to
them by China and Taiwan.
	   Japanese authorities declined to say how many Japanese patrol
boats were keeping watch around the islands, about 220 kilometers
(136 miles) northeast of Taipei in the East China Sea.
	   Kyodo News agency said about 50 were in the area.
	   Two years ago, a Hong Kong activist jumped overboard and drowned
on a similar expedition when Japanese coast guard vessels kept him
from landing on the islands.
	   On a later protest expedition, several activists from Taiwan and
Hong Kong succeeded in planting a flag briefly on one of the
islands.

Overstretched army outwitted by rebels; Ugandans urge talks 
</HEADLINE>
By HENRY WASSWA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Growing numbers of Ugandans are
questioning the ability of their national army to contain, let
alone defeat, rebels who are terrorizing a third of the country and
abducting school children to serve in their ranks.
	   And even though President Yoweri Museveni refuses to negotiate,
lawmakers, church leaders and human rights groups plan to meet
Friday in the northern town of Gulu to discuss how to approach the
rebels for talks.
	   The call for negotiations grew stronger after the Alliance of
Democratic Forces attacked the Kichwamba Technical Institute in
western Uganda on June 8. At least 80 perished when rebels set fire
to dormitories after the students refused to join them. Another 100
were abducted.
	   Four days later, the Lord's Resistance Army, which has
terrorized most of northern Uganda over the past 11 years, attacked
a trading center near Apac, 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of
Kampala and looted stores.
	   On June 20, the LRA abducted 40 girls from a northern Uganda
boarding school. They hit another school June 23, making off with
19 students, 14 of whom were later freed.
	   The army recently boasted it had LRA leader Joseph Kony and 600
rebels surrounded. But he got away _ again.
	   Charges of corruption and outright incompetence in the army are
now commonplace. The detachment guarding the technical institute
fled. Its commander is under arrest.
	   ``We in uniform have not discharged our duty,'' said Army chief
Maj. Gen. Jeje Odongo. ``We recognize this fault and have no
excuses.''
	   Other reports say senior officers routinely siphon off wages
intended for the troops.
	   During a recent meeting with relatives of the victims of the
Kichwamba attack, Museveni acknowledged a weakness on the part of
the government and said the army had betrayed the country.
	   ``There used to be two problems with the national army ...
indiscipline, raping women and killing,'' Museveni said. ``I fought
and defeated that problem ... But now I still have to effectively
deal with the problem of laziness.''
	   But opposition politician Paul Semogerere said the problem has
gone beyond the government's ability to control it.
	   ``There is a need to change the course adopted by the
government, which has failed.''
	   A former rebel chief himself, Museveni says other Ugandans are
welcome to talk to the rebels, but his government will pursue a
military option.
	   ``My view is to use the means that helped us in the past to get
rid of Amin and Obote,'' said Museveni, referring to rebel wars _
including his own _ that devastated Uganda for 15 years and ousted
the governments of dictator Idi Amin Dada and authoritarian
president Milton Obote.
	   To the dismay of donor nations who underwrite most of Uganda's
health and education programs, Museveni asked parliament to swallow
a 24 percent increase in military spending in the 1998-99 budget.
	   The Ugandan People's Defense Force _ Museveni's former rebel
army _ has been whittled down from 100,000 in 1990 to its current
40,000 strength in compliance with demands from the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
	   The London-based International Instutite of Strategic Studies
estimates that together, both well-armed rebel groups do not number
more than 2,000. Uganda claims they are both funded by Sudan, and
international analysts tend to agree. But Sudan denies the claim.

Nigerian Olowokandi chosen No. 1 by Clippers AP Basketball Writer

6th grafs, INSERTS new 21st graf with quote about Nowitzki.
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Michael Olowokandi, a
7-foot-1 (2.16-meter) Nigerian who grew up in England and has been
playing competitive basketball for only three years, was selected
first in the NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers.
	   The Clippers decided to pick Olowokandi in Wednesday night's
draft instead of Arizona point guard Mike Bibby, the player they
had been expected to take until having a change of heart over the
last couple of days.
	   Olowokandi, who barely knew how to play the game when he arrived
at Pacific University, averaged 22.2 points and 11.2 rebounds last
season.
	   ``Seeing my name in the No. 1 spot is unbelievable, especially
when you consider where I came from three years ago _ not having
played basketball _ and then to this, not the No. 3 pick but the
No. 1 pick,'' Olowokandi said. ``That's something that'll take me a
week or so, or a little bit longer, to get over.''
	   His father, a Nigerian diplomat, and mother traveled across an
ocean and a continent to see him picked _ the first time they had
seen him do anything associated with basketball.
	   ``I'm sure they don't fully appreciate or have a good feel for
the significance of being the No. 1 pick,'' Olowokandi said of his
parents, who have never seen him play. ``I kind of feel sorry for
them. They came to this whole thing still struggling with
basketball ideals.''
	   Five trades were made during the draft:
	   _ The Toronto Raptors, after picking Antawn Jamison of North
Carolina fourth overall, sent him to Golden State for his college
teammate, Vince Carter, who was selected fifth.
	   _ The Phoenix Suns sent guard Steve Nash to the Dallas Mavericks
in a three-way trade also involving Milwaukee. The Bucks got the
sixth pick, Robert ``Tractor'' Traylor, from the Mavericks in
exchange for the ninth pick, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, and the 19th
pick, Pat Garrity of Notre Dame. Garrity was then sent to the Suns
along with Bubba Wells, Martin Muursepp and Dallas' 1999
first-round pick for Nash, whose parents came to the draft to
represent the Suns.
	   _ The Vancouver Grizzlies, after selecting Bibby, dealt guard
Antonio Daniels to San Antonio for Carl Herrera and the rights to
the 24th pick, Felipe Lopez.
	   _ The Utah Jazz sent the 29th pick, Nazr Mohammed of Kentucky,
to Philadelphia for future considerations.
	   _ The Los Angeles Lakers sent guard Nick Van Exel to Denver in
exchange for Tyronn Lue, the second of the Nuggets' two first-round
picks, and Tony Battie.
	   The Raptors also were talking with the New York Knicks about a
Marcus Camby-Charles Oakley trade, according to sources who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The Grizzlies, the hosts of the draft, selected Bibby second to
roars of approval from a crowd of about 8,000. Bibby, who left
Arizona after his sophomore season, has drawn comparisons to Jason
Kidd for his playmaking skills. Many expected him to be drafted
first overall.
	   ``Me being No. 1 was just a lot of talk and rumor, so I didn't
expect anything,'' said Bibby, whose father, Henry, played several
years in the NBA and now coaches Southern Cal.
	   The Denver Nuggets, coming off a season in which they won only
11 games, picked Kansas forward Raef LaFrentz with the third pick.
	   It was the first surprise of the night, since Paul Pierce,
considered by many to be the best all-around player in the draft,
had been expected to be among the top three picks. He ended up
dropping all the way to the Boston Celtics at No. 10.
	   LaFrentz, a 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) forward, was a first-team
All-American after averaging 19.8 points and 11.1 rebounds for the
Jayhawks.
	   Traylor, who dropped 40 pounds (18 kilograms) after the season
ended, tipped the scales at about 320 pounds (144 kilograms) while
averaging 16.2 points and 10.0 rebounds for Michigan. By acquiring
him, the Bucks extended their streak of trading their first-round
pick to four straight years.
	   The agent for the 6-foot-11 (2.11-meter) Nowitzki, who is
currently in the German army, told teams that his client may choose
to play professionally in Europe for the next season or two. Dallas
coach Don Nelson said he and his son, Donnie, who once coached the
20-year-old, will be leaving soon for Germany to convince Nowitzki
to play for the Mavericks.
	   ``I want him here right away if it's possible,'' Nelson said.
``If it doesn't happen ... we'll have to wait. I think he's worth
the wait. Hopefully we won't have to wait.''

Iraqi newspapers denounce U.N. decision to prolong sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with comments about Butler
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's most influential newspaper on
Thursday accused the chief U.N. weapons inspector of being an
American lackey after he told the Security Council that Iraq had
loaded a deadly nerve gas on missiles.
	   ``The mad dog is barking louder and louder,'' the Babil
newspaper said, referring to Richard Butler who is often described
in that derogatory way in Iraq.
	   ``This dog is implementing to the letter American instructions
regarding Iraq,'' a front-page editorial in Babil said. The
newspaper is owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai.
	   Butler reported to the Security Council on Wednesday that a U.S.
Army laboratory found traces of the VX gas during tests on Iraqi
missile heads.
	   If corroborated, the finding would indicate that the Iraqi
government lied to U.N. inspectors in claiming that it never
produced weapons grade VX let alone mount it on weapons, a position
that top officials continued to take.
	   ``I am surprised. We know very well VX was never weaponized. We
know this. We have done this ourselves ... Now, how did the VX
appear there (on missile warheads), we have no idea,'' Lt. Gen.
Amer al-Saadi, a presidential adviser and father of Iraq's chemical
warfare program, told reporters late Wednesday.
	   Iraq has said the U.S. tests were a fabrication and Butler on
Wednesday ordered an independent verification in laboratories in
France and Switzerland.
	   Many Iraqis believe that the United States works behind the
scenes to prevent the lifting of the U.N. sanctions, which were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Security Council
extended the sanctions by another two months on Wednesday.
	   The embargo cannot be lifted until Butler's inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction. With
the VX disclosure, that is unlikely to happen soon.
	   But the ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra insisted Thursday
that Iraq has no more illegal weapons to disclose and the sanctions
must go.
	   ``Regarding further documents (on weapons), Iraq cannot provide
what it does not have,'' the newspaper said in a commentary.
	   It said the VX report ``is aimed at maintaining the status quo
... This is not possible and no one is ready to accept it.''
	   ``Iraq shall not yield to this oppression,'' it said.
	   Other state-controlled newspapers on Thursday republished a
statement issued by Iraqi leaders on May 1, warning the Security
Council of unspecified ``grave consequences'' if the embargo is not
lifted.
	   Despite the tensions, international weapons inspectors
overseeing Iraq's weapons elimination are coming to Baghdad in
large numbers under a Iraq-U.N. deal last week to speed up
disarmament activities, a U.N. official said.
	   ``In addition to normal monitoring we are now focusing hard on
planning, bringing in more and more inspection teams,'' Nils
Carlstrom, the top U.N. arms official in Iraq, told The Associated
Press.

Court annuls 1994 Air France state aid decision comments; TRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS Commission reaction, British Airways, British Midlands
<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) - A court voided Thursday a 1994 decision by the
European Union executive Commission to allow the French government
to pour 20 billion French francs (dlrs 3.3 billion dollars) into
the beleaguered state-owned company Air France.
	   The European Court of First Instance ruled in favor of rival
airlines who argued the aid violated EU competition rules. The
airlines were British Airways, British Midlands Airways, Dutch flag
carrier KLM and SAS, which is jointly owned by Norway, Sweden and
Denmark.
	   The European Commission said it is studying the court's ruling.
	   ``The court has spent the last 14 months drafting a 100-page
decision. You'll understand if it takes us at least 14 days to
study our options,'' said EU spokeswoman Sarah Lambert.
	   She said the Commission will take its decision at the latest by
the end of July.
	   The Commission has two months to appeal the ruling. If it does,
the case will go to the European Court of Justice. The Court of
First Instance is the arm of the Court of Justice that deals with
competition cases.
	   In a statement, the court said it is up to the Commission to
``reconsider the matter in order to adopt the measures which
compliance with this judgement dictates.''
	   The other airlines applauded the court's decision. ``We welcome
the fact that we shall now have much clearer rules on the use of
state aid in the aviation sector,'' a spokesman for British
Midlands said.
	   A British Airways spokesman said the decision ``sends a clear
message to other state airlines in Europe that the future lies in
private hands, not in the pockets of taxpayers.''
	   The plaintiffs argued that the use of some of the funds by Air
France to buy 17 new aircrafts was unjustified, and that the
Commission failed to investigate the negative impact the aid would
have on transatlantic airlines, as well as those using local routes
into Paris.
	   The Commission authorized the aid because it hoped the money
would help develop European air transport. Its conditions included
assurances that Air France would neither acquire new aircraft,
merge with its Air Inter unit nor open any new routes within Europe
for three years.
	   Furthermore, the airline was to restructure and return to
profitability by 1996.
	   Air France in Paris claimed the court's decision would not
affect the money given to the airline.
	   ``Today is not the end of the story,'' EU spokeswoman Lambert
said. ``Right now there is no question of Air France having to pay
back the money.''
	   The Commission is empowered to approve or block cases of state
aid in the 15-nation EU on the basis of whether they violate the
EU's competition rules.

By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton came to China on
Thursday to pursue at a summit, at village roundtables, with
communists and with stockbrokers, the East-West relationship he
calls vital to peace and stability in the 21st Century.
	   Air Force One touched down in sweltering Xi'an, where crowds of
evening onlookers lined the streets along his route to the old
walled city amid the modern one. Security was tight; Chinese
authorities stationed water cannons in side streets nearby.
	   The extravagant ceremonial welcome at the South Gate of the Old
City began a presidential mission disputed at home, a sendoff
marred by formal diplomatic protest after China barred three radio
reporters for Radio Free Asia, a U.S. government broadcaster
nettling to Beijing.
	   During the long journey to China, Clinton said he will be
striving for the advancement of political and human rights, an
issue rankling a Congress divided over his policy of cordial
engagement and investigating his prior deals with Beijing.
	   Of the growing controversy over technology exports, Beijing's
foreign ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said Thursday that
cooperation on satellite launches ``benefits both sides. Those who
are in the mainstream of bilateral relations should have a correct
view.''
	   Tang dismissed U.S. investigations as ``a wave of noise in the
United States that is intended to obstruct the development of
bilateral relations with the United States. We believe it by no
means represents the attitude of most American people.''
	   Clinton views his nine-day mission to China, the first by an
American president since George Bush's in February 1989, as the
right way to increase America's impact on human rights, nuclear
weapons spread and efforts to stabilize shaken Asian economies.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' Clinton said
at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, where his plane stopped to
refuel.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' he told about 4,000 people
who turned out to see him on his way.
	   But even as Clinton flew to China, Chinese police arrested two
dissidents in a display of Beijing's hard line against
pro-democracy activists.
	   Clinton's first stop Thursday was Xi'an, the ancient walled
capital. The gritty industrial city surrounding it now was primped,
painted and flag-decked for Clinton's arrival.
	   On Friday, Clinton goes to the village of Xia He for what is
billed as a roundtable discussion with ordinary Chinese citizens
about their lives in a changing society. He'll speak in the village
square. Then Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, are
tourists for an afternoon, visiting the unearthed terra cotta
warriors, pottery soldiers fashioned to guard an emperor in the
afterlife.
	   Then to Beijing on Saturday, opening with the event that has
stirred the greatest controversy at home: a formal welcoming in
Tiananmen Square, scene of the democracy demonstrations bloodily
repressed by Chinese troops in June 1989.
	   Clinton defends his decision to go to that symbolic site as
protocol, not substance, and said he will speak America's piece for
human rights and freedom. But not there; no speeches at Tiananmen.
	   The president said it would be wrong for him to demand that the
Chinese change the way they welcome world leaders to Beijing, but
``equally wrong for me to go there and take no notice of the
continuing difficulties with human and political rights.''
	   So he said he will do both, the latter, probably, in an address
at Beijing University on Monday.
	   Critics at home, however, kept up the pressure. The House voted
late Wednesday to include in a dlrs 250 billion defense spending
bill a provision that would bar the Pentagon from buying any
product manufactured by the Chinese government or its army.
	   Separately, a senior Pentagon adviser, Peter Leitner, said he
believed business interests had been allowed to override national
security concerns in deals with China.
	   The weekend is the actual summit with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, the joint meetings of U.S. and Chinese officials and the
state banquet at the Great Hall of the People. Clinton and Jiang
are to dine privately Sunday evening.
	   But ceremonies and state visits did not shroud the discordant
notes of U.S.-China relationships. That was dramatized when the
Chinese canceled visas for three reporters of Radio Free Asia, a
U.S.-financed operation that beams broadcasts here, jammed by the
Beijing government.
	   Clinton countered by granting the three a White House interview,
saying the Chinese government made a big mistake, and that ideas do
not need visas. He said he supported Radio Free Asia, not against
the Chinese government but for the advancement of freedom of speech
and debate.

Trader Don turns salesman to court German draft pick 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE DRAGO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ For the past week, he was Trader Don. Now he's Don
Nelson, traveling salesman and chairman of the Dallas Mavericks'
recruiting committee.
	   Nelson, predictably unpredictable at NBA draft time, landed
6-foot-11 German forward Dirk Nowitzki in a three-way trade with
Milwaukee and Phoenix during the first round Wednesday night.
	   The trick now is getting Nowitzki, who Nelson said is ``loaded
with talent,'' to bypass European basketball and earn less money
with the perennially rebuilding Mavericks.
	   On that sales job, the Mavericks are pulling no punches.
	   Nelson said he would leave for Germany Thursday with his son,
assistant coach Donnie Nelson. Team owner Ross Perot Jr., already
in Europe on business, will meet them.
	   New Dallas point guard Steve Nash, obtained from Phoenix as part
of the trade and vacationing in England, will also be asked to join
the lobbying effort.
	   It's a full-court press for the 20-year-old German. Nelson said
he'll tout his own enthusiasm, the Dallas lifestyle and the premise
that the Mavericks are turning things around.
	   ``I believe that I'll do a good job at trying to convince him,''
Nelson said. ``You don't have control over other people's wishes,
but I think we have a lot to offer.''
	   ``We're going to sit down and give it our best shot, that's
all.''
	   Asked for a guess as to the odds he faces, Nelson was blunt.
	   ``I don't have a clue,'' he said. ``I'm just hoping, that's all.
I wish I could give you percentages and all that. I don't know.''
	   If he's successful, the gamble could pay off big. Nowitzki
averaged 17.5 points and 10 rebounds for DJK Wurzburg last season.
	   He dazzled scouts at the Nike Hoop Summit in San Antonio in
March, finishing with 33 points and 14 rebounds before going back
to Germany and enlisting in the army to fulfill his military
obligation.
	   ``He's 20 years old and loaded with talent, and we have to let
him develop,'' said Nelson, who projects Nowitzki as a small
forward. ``So I don't want you to think we're going to get Larry
Bird here in his first year, but he's a very exciting player.''
	   Nowitzki's agent told teams before the draft that his client
might choose to play professionally in Europe for one or two years.
In addition to staying closer to home, Nowitzki can earn more money
in Europe because he won't pay taxes. As an NBA rookie, his salary
is set for three years, plus he faces taxes.
	   Should Nowitzki decide to stay in Europe, Nelson said he's
content to wait. The Mavericks will continue to hold his rights.
	   ``I want him here right away if it's possible,'' Nelson said.
``If it doesn't happen ... we'll have to wait. I think he's worth
the wait. Hopefully we won't have to wait.''
	   One element of Wednesday's trade could come back to bite Nelson.
The Mavericks sent their No. 1 pick next year to Phoenix, along
with forwards Bubba Wells and Martin Muursepp, in exchange for
Nash. Phoenix also got the rights to Pat Garrity of Notre Dame in
the deal with Milwaukee, which got the rights to Robert Traylor.
	   It's the second time in three years that Dallas has traded its
top pick _ last year's went to Boston in the Eric Montross trade.
Another dismal season for Dallas, and the Suns will get a lottery
pick.
	   ``I don't like to do it for sure, so we have to make sure that
we're as good as I think we can be,'' Nelson said.

Asian stocks close mixed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian markets closed mixed Thursday as
investors remained cautious over a persistently volatile yen.
	   Tokyo stocks edged higher as investors showed optimism that U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to China may help stabilize the yen
and boost the ailing Japanese economy. But they also were waiting
for further progress in the Japanese government's efforts to revive
the financial sector.
	   Buoyed by gains in export-oriented technology shares on the U.S.
dollar's renewed strength, the 225-issue Nikkei average rose 9.04
points, or 0.06 percent, closing at 15,132.22. It had gained 68.58
points Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the Japanese yen hit a midday low of 141.65 yen
against the U.S. dollar, the lowest level since joint intervention
by Washington and Tokyo to prop up the yen last week. In late
trading, the yen climbed to 140.92 yen.
	   Despite the yen's weakness, Hong Kong shares closed sharply
higher as Clinton's visit helped improve market sentiment.
Futures-related buying ahead of the June expiration next Monday
also triggered the rally, traders said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index opened higher and continued to
rise, surging 369.06 points, or 4.4 percent, and closing at
8,665.83.
	   ``People are buying a lot of big-cap stocks on the eve of the
index expiry'' to push up the underlying index, said Antony Mak,
director of sales at Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd.
	   In South Korea, share prices on the Korea Stock Exchange closed
slightly lower on worries over a possible early listing of Korea
Telecom, which analysts say would flood the already oversupplied
market with more stocks.
	   The weaker yen, which would undercut the competitiveness of
South Korea's exports, also discouraged investors, analysts said.
	   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down 1.15 points,
closing at 300.57.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended higher as fresh Wall Street gains spurred
investors back into the stock market for the second consecutive
day. The Weighted Stock Price Index rose 51.93 points, closing at
7,722.64.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand stocks closed lower, with brokers saying
the market slipped following the release of key economic data. The
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index was down 10.18 points to 1,960.00.
	   MANILA: Shares closed lower, giving up earlier gains in a mild
rally to profit-takers. The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
Index fell 3.85 points to 1,709.03.
	   SYDNEY: Share prices closed marginally lower as lingering fears
about the direction of the Australian dollar failed to attract
offshore buying. The All Ordinaries Index fell .80 points to 2,592.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed slightly lower, taking their cue from
weak regional currencies in the absence of any fresh factors. The
Straits Times Industrials Index fell 5.02 points, closing at
1,069.83.
	   BANGKOK: Thai shares ended lower on concerns about the
implications of weakness in the Japanese yen for prospects in
Thailand. The benchmark Stock Exchange of Thailand index lost 3.65
points, or 1.4 percent, to 264.09.
	   JAKARTA: Shares closed lower as bearish economic indicators
confirmed fears about the state of the country's economy, despite a
new International Monetary Fund bail-out agreement. The Jakarta
Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.18 points to 428.810.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares finished lower as investors continued to
eye the currency market, particularly the Japanese yen. The
Composite Index fell 6.95 points to 448.42.

Norwegian unemployment rises to 2.4 percent as jobs programs cut 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's official unemployment rate rose to
2.4 percent at the end of June from 2.2 percent a month earlier,
but remained well below the 3.4 percent rate reported for June
1997, the state Labor Directorate announced Thursday.
	   The agency said 55,800 people were registered as being
completely unemployed as of Thursday, compared with 51,300 one
month ago and 75,000 a year ago.
	   The main reason for the increased joblessness rate was that
fewer people were employed in government work and training
programs. Those programs employed 11,561 people in June, down
sharply from the 18,700 people reported for May.

Hamas founder opposes Palestinian statehood 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) - Raising a new point of dispute, the
leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas said Thursday he opposed
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's plans to declare a state in May
1999.
	   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who returned to Gaza late Wednesday after a
four-month fundraising tour in the Middle East, said a state
covering only small parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would
have little value.
	   ``I will support a state when occupation is gone. I am against
establishing a state while occupation continues, because it would
be a worthless state,'' the white-bearded Yassin told an news
conference convened on a soccer field near his Gaza City home.
	   Israel and the Palestinians are to have negotiated a permanent
peace agreement by May 1999, but there is little chance the talks
will begin anytime soon. Arafat has said he would unilaterally
declare statehood in the parts of the West Bank and Gaza under his
control if there was no agreement by the deadline.
	   The quadriplegic 62-year-old Yassin sat in his wheelchair on a
makeshift dais, ringed by supporters and guards, including three
armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and pistols. Relying on a
hearing aid, Yassin spoke in a strained, high-pitched voice.
	   Yassin is Arafat's most formidable political rival, and Hamas'
power has grown considerably since Yassin was released from an
Israeli jail in October.
	   During his tour of nearly a dozen capitals in the Muslim world,
Yassin was often treated like a head of state and raised millions
of dollars for Hamas. The group has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994 to scuttle the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.
	   Yassin was evasive Thursday when asked how much money he had
raised. ``They say I brought 50, 30, 200 (million dollars). Let
them say what they want and imagine what they want,'' he said.
	   Yassin said his movement would continue the attacks on Israel.
``As long as there is occupation, there will be resistance,'' he
said.
	   Yassin described himself as the head of Hamas' political wing,
and said he did not know about ``the circumstances and resources''
of the group's military arm, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   Despite his criticism of Arafat, Yassin said he would
``cooperate with the Palestinian Authority until we get rid of the
occupation.''
	   However, Yassin spurned Arafat's offers to Hamas to join a new
Palestinian Cabinet he is trying to put together within two weeks.
``We cannot reject the peace accords and implement them at the same
time,'' he said.

Borderline calls in key spots put refs in spotlight matches graded as unacceptable, U.S. referee defended for Brazil-Norway call AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments by referee chairman, 3
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The chief of World Cup referees defended his
embattled brigade Thursday, saying the quality of officiating was
higher than four years ago and that new evidence supported a
questionable call by a U.S. referee in a key match.
	   David Will, a Scottish lawyer who has run FIFA's referee office
for eight years, said overall officiating in the first 40 games
averaged 8.3 points out of 10, and marks were getting better as the
tournament progressed. Most games were graded between 8 and 9 by
the officiating supervisors, he said.
	   Refereeing in three of the first 40 games was judged
unsatisfactory, Will said. He refused to identify the matches but
said none of the sub-par grades involved red or yellow cards and
that all were judged ``on overall performance throughout a match,
not one decision that might have been off target.''
	   Will said the last World Cup in 1994 in the United States
produced four unsatisfactorily refereed matches, all in the first
round when there were fewer games than at this World Cup.
	   ``We remain generally satisfied with the performance of the
referees,'' he said. ``The overall standard remains high _ higher
than in the United States, to be sure. ''
	   Will spoke at a news conference as criticism of the referees
came from all directions.
	   Players and coaches said the referees were inconsistent. FIFA
president Sepp Blatter said they were too soft on hard fouls. A
government minister in Cameroon said they were part of an
anti-African plot.
	   Will said his 34 men were doing their job properly.
	   ``The referees play it straight,'' he said. ``They call it as
they see it. They don't have the benefit of replays from five
angles.''
	   He said an instant-replay system to backstop calls would not
work in soccer, except perhaps on goals. But, he added, replays had
found evidence to support one of the most argued calls of the Cup.
	   Esse Baharmast of the United States called a foul on Junior
Baiano of Brazil that set up the winning penalty kick in Norway's
2-1 victory Tuesday. That moved Norway into the second round and
eliminated Morocco, a 3-0 winner over Scotland.
	   Initial replays showed contact but no clear foul. But Will
pointed to photos taken from the Norwegian television network NRK
that show Baiano clearly grabbing the jersey of the Norwegian
player, T.A. Flo, in the penalty area.
	   Will, who generally will not discuss individual calls or games,
went out of his way to defend Baharmast.
	   ``The referee, from his angle, took a decision and played it as
he saw it, direct and straightforward,'' the official said. ``You
can look at television and photographs and pictures on the
Internet. But at the end of the day, the referee has to make a
decision on the field in a split second as he sees it.''
	   Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner nullified a
goal that would have put Cameroon ahead of Chile 2-1, calling
Patrick Mboma for pushing off a defender. Replays showed contact,
but no clear foul. The 1-1 tie, coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory
over Austria, meant Chile advanced and Cameroon was out.
	   That sparked attacks in the Cameroon capital of Yaounde by black
fans on white-owned businesses and harsh words from the government.
	   ``What we saw is not a World Cup competition. It has been a
festival of scandal,'' Youth and Sports Minister Joseph Owona told
the African Nation newspaper.
	   Will said charges of political favoritism were ``just
ridiculous.''
	   ``The referees are not the slightest bit interested in the
political situation,'' he said. ``They are simply refereeing the
game. They don't even known who the two teams are. They go from
match to match and round to round.''
	   Nor did Will believe that the refs had been influenced by
Blatter's call for more punishment against players who tackle from
behind or make other dangerous moves.
	   The 15 expulsions for rough play in the first 40 games _ equal
to the total of four years ago _ was ``not higher than the number
that we reasonably would have expected,'' Will said. He said the
explosion of five red cards in two games the day after Blatter's
comments, compared with four in the previous 20 games, was ``pure
chance.''

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An EgyptAir flight to London was delayed by
four hours after an anonymous caller claimed there was a bomb on

Iraqi newspapers denounce U.N. decision to prolong sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with comments about Butler; TRIMS
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's most influential newspaper on
Thursday accused the chief U.N. weapons inspector of being a U.S
lackey for telling the Security Council that Iraq had loaded a
deadly nerve gas on missiles.
	   ``The mad dog is barking louder and louder,'' the Babil
newspaper said in a front page editorial, using its favorite
epithet for Richard Butler. ``This dog is implementing to the
letter American instructions regarding Iraq.''
	   The newspaper is owned by President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai.
	   Butler reported to the Security Council on Wednesday that a U.S.
Army laboratory found traces of the VX gas during tests on Iraqi
missile heads.
	   If corroborated, the finding would indicate that the Iraqi
government lied to U.N. inspectors in claiming that it never
produced weapons grade VX let alone mounted it on weapons, a
position that top officials continued to take.
	   ``I am surprised. We know very well VX was never weaponized. We
know this. We have done this ourselves ... Now, how did the VX
appear there (on missile warheads), we have no idea,'' Lt. Gen.
Amer al-Saadi, a presidential adviser and father of Iraq's chemical
warfare program, told reporters late Wednesday.
	   Iraq has said the U.S. tests were a fabrication and Butler on
Wednesday ordered an independent verification in laboratories in
France and Switzerland.
	   Many Iraqis believe that the United States works behind the
scenes to prevent the lifting of the U.N. sanctions, imposed after
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The Security Council extended the
sanctions by another two months on Wednesday.
	   The embargo cannot be lifted until Butler's inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction. With
the VX disclosure, that is unlikely to happen soon.
	   The VX report ``is aimed at maintaining the status quo,'' said
the ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra said. ``This is not
possible and no one is ready to accept it ... Iraq shall not yield
to this oppression.''
	   Other state-controlled newspapers on Thursday republished a
statement issued by Iraqi leaders on May 1, warning the Security
Council of unspecified ``grave consequences'' if the embargo is not
lifted.
	   Despite the tensions, international weapons inspectors
overseeing Iraq's weapons elimination are coming to Baghdad in
large numbers under a Iraq-U.N. deal last week to speed up
disarmament activities, U.N. officials said.

Vatican gives broad agreement to lift Catholic condemnations of Lutherans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican gave its broad agreement
Thursday to a joint declaration with the Lutherans intended to
settle a doctrinal dispute that was at the heart of the 16th
century Protestant Reformation.
	   With the agreement, most of the condemnations that the Lutherans
and Roman Catholic church heaped on each other when Western
Christianity split no longer apply, the Vatican said.
	   But while the Vatican said that a ``high degree of agreement''
has been reached, it acknowledged that some differences on
fundamental doctrine remain requiring further study.
	   The Lutheran World Federation announced June 16 that its ruling
council had unanimously approved a declaration lifting the
condemnations.
	   One of the key unresolved points regards what theologians call
``justification'' -- that is, how man achieves salvation. For the
Lutherans, it depends on the grace of God, while Catholics maintain
that good works are also involved.
	   The Reformation stereotype was of Catholics earning their
salvation through the buying of papal indulgences.
	   ``The level of agreement is high. but it does not yet allow us
to affirm that all the differences separating Catholics and
Lutherans in the doctrine of justification are simply a question of
emphasis or language,'' the Vatican said.
	   Cardinal Edward Cassidy, who heads the Vatican's office for
relations with other denominations, said of 44 points in the
declaration only three lacked full agreement.
	   He said the formal signing of the Joint Declaration will take
place this fall.
	   The declaration was drawn up last year by an international group
of Catholic and Lutheran theologians.
	   It was sent to the federation's 124 member churches, who
represent 57 million Lutherans, and the Vatican for approval.
	   Last year, the United States' largest Lutheran church, the 5.2
million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, endorsed the
declaration.
	   The ELCA is one of the federation's two largest churches. The
other, the Church of Sweden, has also endorsed the declaration.

Russian nuclear experts deny report of nuclear contamination threat 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nuclear officials denied accusations by an
environmental lawyer Thursday who warned of contamination from
radioactive water pumped underground for decades by a Russian
chemical plant.
	   The denials came in response to an article in the daily Moscow
Times charging that Russia's Tomsk-7 chemical and nuclear complex
has been pumping liquid radioactive waste into groundwater since
1963. The report cited Tomsk environmental lawyer Konstantin
Lebedev.
	   Lebedev told the paper that the radioactive waste 280 meters
(yards) to 400 meters (yards) underground could contaminate
drinking water. He has filed suit asking to have the plant's
pumping license revoked.
	   Dr. Andrei Rybalchenko, head of a research laboratory at the
Russian Institute for Industrial Design which controls industrial
waste disposals, said the lawyer's claims are groundless.
	   The pumping has been taking place for 38 years, he said, and
inspections by teams of geologists and environmentalists have found
no contamination of the region's land or drinking water.
	   The waste is pumped through insulated shafts, and the
underground reservoir is surrounded by water-resistant clay that
keeps the contaminated water from seeping through.
	   Observation shafts have been drilled to monitor radiation levels
in the layers above and below the waste dumps. No increase has been
registered, Rybalchenko said.
	   The radioactive waste water may begin to seep into neighboring
layers in 800 to 1,000 years, Rybalchenko said. But by then the
level of radiation would be too low to present any danger, he said.
	   Tomsk-7 is a formerly secret city of 110,000 containing five
nuclear reactors about 10 miles from Tomsk, the provincial capital
of 500,000. It is located some 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) east
of Moscow.

Overstretched army outwitted by rebels; Ugandans urge talks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RETRANSMITS to fix slug
By HENRY WASSWA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Growing numbers of Ugandans are
questioning the ability of their national army to contain, let
alone defeat, rebels who are terrorizing a third of the country and
abducting school children to serve in their ranks.
	   And even though President Yoweri Museveni refuses to negotiate,
lawmakers, church leaders and human rights groups plan to meet
Friday in the northern town of Gulu to discuss how to approach the
rebels for talks.
	   The call for negotiations grew stronger after the Alliance of
Democratic Forces attacked the Kichwamba Technical Institute in
western Uganda on June 8. At least 80 perished when rebels set fire
to dormitories after the students refused to join them. Another 100
were abducted.
	   Four days later, the Lord's Resistance Army, which has
terrorized most of northern Uganda over the past 11 years, attacked
a trading center near Apac, 170 kilometers (105 miles) north of
Kampala and looted stores.
	   On June 20, the LRA abducted 40 girls from a northern Uganda
boarding school. They hit another school June 23, making off with
19 students, 14 of whom were later freed.
	   The army recently boasted it had LRA leader Joseph Kony and 600
rebels surrounded. But he got away _ again.
	   Charges of corruption and outright incompetence in the army are
now commonplace. The detachment guarding the technical institute
fled. Its commander is under arrest.
	   ``We in uniform have not discharged our duty,'' said Army chief
Maj. Gen. Jeje Odongo. ``We recognize this fault and have no
excuses.''
	   Other reports say senior officers routinely siphon off wages
intended for the troops.
	   During a recent meeting with relatives of the victims of the
Kichwamba attack, Museveni acknowledged a weakness on the part of
the government and said the army had betrayed the country.
	   ``There used to be two problems with the national army ...
indiscipline, raping women and killing,'' Museveni said. ``I fought
and defeated that problem ... But now I still have to effectively
deal with the problem of laziness.''
	   But opposition politician Paul Semogerere said the problem has
gone beyond the government's ability to control it.
	   ``There is a need to change the course adopted by the
government, which has failed.''
	   A former rebel chief himself, Museveni says other Ugandans are
welcome to talk to the rebels, but his government will pursue a
military option.
	   ``My view is to use the means that helped us in the past to get
rid of Amin and Obote,'' said Museveni, referring to rebel wars _
including his own _ that devastated Uganda for 15 years and ousted
the governments of dictator Idi Amin Dada and authoritarian
president Milton Obote.
	   To the dismay of donor nations who underwrite most of Uganda's
health and education programs, Museveni asked parliament to swallow
a 24 percent increase in military spending in the 1998-99 budget.
	   The Ugandan People's Defense Force _ Museveni's former rebel
army _ has been whittled down from 100,000 in 1990 to its current
40,000 strength in compliance with demands from the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
	   The London-based International Instutite of Strategic Studies
estimates that together, both well-armed rebel groups do not number
more than 2,000. Uganda claims they are both funded by Sudan, and
international analysts tend to agree. But Sudan denies the claim.

EU industrial production on the rise 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Industrial production in the 15-nation
European Union rose by 1.4 percent in the first three months of
1998, compared with the previous three-month period, the EU's
statistics office said Thursday.
	   It was also up 1.4 percent for the 11 countries that qualify for
the launching of the single currency, the euro on January 1, 1999,
Eurostat said in a statement.
	   Finland registered the highest three-month rise, with 2.2
percent, followed by Germany (1.9 percent), and Greece (1.5
percent).
	   Below the EU average were Portugal (1.3 percent), Luxembourg
(0.9 percent), Belgium (0.4 percent), Britain (0.3 percent), Italy
(0.3 percent), and the Netherlands (-0.1 percent).
	   Denmark, France and Spain all registered 1.4 percent growth.
	   No figures were available for Austria, Ireland and Sweden.
	   Using the same three-month reference, Eurostat noted that U.S.
industrial production was up 0.5 percent, while Japan suffered a
1.8 percent decline.

Military commander in Jakarta capital replaced 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The military commander in Jakarta, a
onetime loyalist of former President Suharto whose forces killed
four students at a protest last month, was replaced Thursday.
	   Armed forces chief Gen. Wiranto said the decision to shift Maj.
Gen. Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin from his prominent post in the Indonesian
capital was a routine reshuffle.
	   Wiranto also replaced the heads of the navy, air force and
police Wednesday.
	   Also on Wednesday, hundreds of police and soldiers blocked
workers from staging an anti-government outside Parliament after
Sjafrie threatened to get tough with political activists.
	   ``I have warned them several times already. If they continue, I
will cripple them,'' The Jakarta Post quoted Sjafrie as saying.
	   Sjafrie was in command when police gunned down four students at
a pro-reform rally at Jakarta's Trisakti University on May 12. In
Indonesia, police are part of the armed forces.
	   The military has charged 18 police officers with disobeying
orders in connection with the deaths. Defense lawyers say their
clients are scapegoats.
	   A police witness has testified that armed officers in black
uniforms and without identification tags were at the protest site,
aside from the police who were implicated.
	   The deaths of the students triggered a wave of rioting that
killed about 1,200 and helped force Suharto to quit after 32 years
in power.
	   Sjafrie, who once served as a Suharto aide, urged his troops to
crack down on the rioters but critics said the military was slow to
respond to the citywide mayhem.
	   Sjafrie will take a less prominent job as adviser on national
affairs to the armed forces chief of staff. He was replaced by Maj.
Gen. Djadja Soeparman, military commander in eastern Java Island.
	   Meanwhile, new President B.J. Habibie announced a five-year plan
to improve Indonesia's human rights record.
	   Habibie, who has pledged democratic reforms, said Indonesia
would ratify a long list of international human rights conventions.
Human rights groups regularly chastised Indonesia for abuses during
the 32-year autocratic rule of Suharto.

Tajikistan president offers amnesty to rebels 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tajikistan's president has asked his parliament to
grant amnesty to some prisoners jailed in connection with a
five-year civil war that ended in 1997, a news agency reported
Thursday.
	   President Imomali Rakhmonov submitted the amnesty bill to mark
the first anniversary of the peace accord signed to end the war,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The accord called for
reconciliation measures such as the appointment of opposition
members to Cabinet posts and amnesties for the mostly Islamic
rebels.
	   The draft calls for the release of women above the age of 45,
pregnant women, women with young children, men older than 55,
invalids, World War II veterans, minor offenders, and probationers
will be released.
	   Following the U.N.-mediated peace accord, Tajikistan's
government has amnestied some rebels and brought others into the
Cabinet. An opposition newspaper that was shut down during the war
has reappeared, and several new papers have started along with new
political parties.
	   But there have been several outbreaks of fighting since the
peace agreement.

Greek president in Cyprus in show of solidarity

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ In a visit widely seen as a show of
solidarity with Greek Cypriots, Greek President Constantinos
Stephanopoulos arrived Thursday in the war-divided Mediterranean
island of Cyprus.
	   The visit, the first to Cyprus by a Greek head of state, comes
at a time of increased saber-rattling between Cyprus and Turkey,
which backs a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   ``This is not a typical diplomatic visit, but a visit of love,
honor and affection,'' Stephanopoulos said on arrival.
	   The Greek leader, whose red carpet welcome at Larnaca airport
was carried live on television and radio, was received by Greek
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and his entire Cabinet.
	   Stephanopoulos is a figurehead and his office is largely
ceremonial, but his four-day visit has prompted Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel to schedule a visit to the Turkish-Cypriot part of
Cyprus next week.
	   ``The presence in Cyprus of the Greek president sends an
important message, a message that says Greece is here to defend
Cyprus' democracy and justice and our efforts to join the European
family,'' Clerides said.
	   Turkey invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in
1974. A Turkish Cypriot state declared in the north in 1983 is
recognized only by Ankara. Clerides' government remains the only
internationally recognized administration on the island.
	   Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been living apart since the
invasion, with a U.N.-patrolled line running across the island
separating them. Repeated international efforts to reunite the
island have so far failed.
	   ``I'll visit all the areas of free Cyprus and take the love of
the Greek people to them,'' Stephanopoulos said.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Cyprus rose last week following the
visits by Turkish and Greek warplanes to the island nation in a
show of force.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.
	   Greece, which has a decades-old dispute with Turkey over rights
in the Aegean sea, has repeatedly stated its intention to fight
alongside its Greek Cypriot allies if hostilities break out on the
island.
	   Such a possibility increased after Turkey threatened military
action to stop the planned deployment in October of Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles that the Clerides government has
purchased from Russia.

Asian economic troubles to be discussed at China-U.S. summit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The turmoil wracking Asia's fragile economies
will be on the agenda of U.S. President Bill Clinton's meetings
with top Chinese leaders, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang
said Thursday.
	   Tang renewed China's demand that Japan do more to stabilize the
value of the Japanese yen, which has resumed its decline against
the U.S. dollar after a brief respite following U.S. and Japanese
intervention last week.
	   Chinese leaders have emphatically criticized Japan for allowing
its currency to weaken, saying the instability was endangering
prospects for a regional economic recovery and China's own economy.
	   ``Japan must show more responsibility,'' Tang told reporters at
a routine media briefing Thursday.
	   While Tang welcomed the effort by the central banks of Japan and
the United States to bolster the yen's value, he said Japan must
continue to support the stability of its currency.

Religious leaders bid for peace as rockets batter Bissau 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ Rocket fire and machine gun shells
bombarded Guinea-Bissau's desolate capital on Thursday as religious
leaders persevered in their efforts to mediate an end to the West
African country's bitter 18-day rebellion.
	   The shelling began in earnest shortly before dawn but became
more subdued later in the morning.
	   Exchanges of short-range rockets were apparently between a
breakaway military faction dug into areas on the edge of the city,
around the airport and a military garrison, and Senegalese troops
who have been laying siege to rebel positions since the uprising
began in this former Portuguese colony on June 7.
	   Reports that Senegalese forces had captured the rebel's
stronghold, the Bra military garrison in Bissau where the uprising
began, proved false late Thursday as renegade leaders took
journalists on a visit to the bullet-riddled complex.
	   Rotting corpses lay in the streets from earlier fighting,
despite efforts by aid groups to dispose of the potentially
disease-bearing bodies.
	   Rockets were also aimed at Nhoma, about 19 miles (28 kilometers)
north of Bissau, one of several points where the breakaway military
units were based.
	   It was unclear where the machine gun fire, which could be heard
in various parts of the city, was originating from. Bissau, a city
of 300,000 people, is now nearly abandoned by civilians.
	   The Roman Catholic Bishop of Bissau, who met Wednesday with a
rebel delegation at Safin, was on Thursday seeking with leaders of
local Muslim and Evangelical communities to hold talks with the
embattled President Joao Bernardo Vieira. There was no confirmation
of a meeting.
	   Bishop Septimio Ferrazeta described his meeting with the
renegade delegation as ``very positive'' but said ``no great
progress'' had been made, Lusa reported giving few details.
	   A delegation led by a parliamentary speaker on Wednesday was
fired on by the rebels they were trying to meet. There were no
injuries and the would-be mediators were forced to turn back.
	   The heavily-armed rebels number more than 2,000 men, a spokesman
for the faction claimed Thursday in an interview with the Portugese
news agency Lusa.
	   Senegal has deployed some 1,300 troops to support the
government.
	   The rebels are led by former military chief Brig. Ansumane Mane,
a veteran guerilla fighter form the colonial war against Portuguese
rule that ended with 1975 independence. Mane has not been seen by
outsiders since the revolt erupted.
	   ``For our part, we feel there can be a military solution (to the
conflict), but there are certain possibilities for dialogue,''
rebel spokesman Maj. Meleciades Gomes Fernandes was quoted by Lusa
as saying.
	   Fernandez said the rebels did not want to seize power, but
simply wanted to ``re-establish justice'' in the country.
	   The rebels, calling themselves a military junta for democracy,
peace and justice, issued a list of 11 demands, Lusa said.
	   The demands included independent investigations into political
corruption, protecting the armed forces from political meddling, an
independent judicial system, and turning the office of president
into a non-party post.
	   Fernandez, who accused Vieira of corruption and abuse of power,
called for him to step down.

Russian parliament delays consideration of emergency economic measures mid-July. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Duma putting off privatization bill vote until
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's opposition-dominated parliament decided
Thursday to delay consideration of a package of emergency economic
measures until next week despite Kremlin pressure for speedy
approval.
	   The measures are needed to put into action a new budget-cutting,
revenue-raising plan designed to win new lending from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Russia's financial markets have been falling for months, with
investors worried over the Asian crisis, plummeting oil prices and
the possibility of social unrest in Russia.
	   The IMF is to decide later Thursday whether to release a delayed
dlrs 670 installment of an existing loan. A decision on Russia's
request for a new, dlrs 10-15 billion loan is expected to take
several weeks.
	   Premier Sergei Kiriyenko submitted the austerity plan to the IMF
on Wednesday, and sent proposed legislation to parliament's lower
house, asking it to pass the bills as rapidly as possible.
	   The Cabinet also asked Thursday that the chamber, the State
Duma, consider long-delayed social welfare legislation as part of
the austerity package.
	   Kiriyenko said that if the bills are passed into law, they will
bring Russia's monthly budget revenues up to 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 4 billion), Russian news agencies reported.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said that the package
of six tax reform bills, which the Cabinet approved Thursday before
sending to it to the Duma, should net the budget almost 37 billion
rubles (dlrs 6 billion) each year.
	   In spite of the government's request for speedy action on the
package, the Duma scheduled debate of the proposed legislation for
July 1, saying it needs time to review the proposals. The date is
just two days before the Duma is scheduled to recess for the
summer.
	   Kiriyenko stressed that the Cabinet was ready to work with the
heads of parliamentary committees, and that its members _ in
contrast to the legislative branch _ were ``ready to put off all
vacations and trips,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Duma is dominated by a coalition of Communists and
hard-liners who oppose President Boris Yeltsin and his economic
policies.
	   The Duma on Thursday put off a preliminary vote on proposed
privatization legislation until its next session, which begins in
September.
	   The program, designed to increase parliament's input into the
privatization process, sets out methods by which state property
will be privatized and lists the state companies that will be sold.
	   Communist leaders have frequently denounced the government's
previous privatization efforts, saying they sold off the state's
most valuable industries at fire-sale prices. The government said
last month that it wanted to accelerate privatization in order to
generate desperately needed revenues for the federal budget.
	   Alexander Braverman, the first deputy minister for state
property, was unfazed by the delay, saying the government can
continue to privatize state companies by decree.
	   ``The lack of a privatization program adopted as a law does not
stop the process of privatization,'' Braverman said.

Hamas founder opposes Palestinian statehood 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The leader of the Islamic militant
group Hamas said Thursday he opposed Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's plans to declare a state next May.
	   Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who returned to Gaza late Wednesday after a
four-month fund-raising tour in the Middle East, said a state
covering only small parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would
have little value.
	   ``I will support a state when occupation is gone. I am against
establishing a state while occupation continues, because it would
be a worthless state,'' the white-bearded Yassin told a news
conference at a soccer field near his Gaza City home.
	   Israel and the Palestinians are to have negotiated a permanent
peace agreement by May 1999, but there is little chance the talks
will begin anytime soon. Arafat has said he would unilaterally
declare statehood in the parts of the West Bank and Gaza under his
control if there was no agreement by the deadline.
	   The quadriplegic 62-year-old Yassin sat in his wheelchair on a
makeshift dais, ringed by supporters and guards, including three
armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and pistols. Relying on a
hearing aid, Yassin spoke in a strained, high-pitched voice.
	   Yassin is Arafat's most formidable political rival, and Hamas'
power has grown considerably since Yassin was released from an
Israeli jail in October.
	   During his tour of nearly a dozen capitals in the Muslim world,
Yassin was often treated like a head of state and raised millions
of dollars for Hamas. The group has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994 to scuttle the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.
	   Yassin was evasive Thursday when asked how much money he had
raised. ``They say I brought 50, 30, 200 (million dollars). Let
them say what they want and imagine what they want,'' he said.
	   Yassin said his movement would continue the attacks on Israel.
``As long as there is occupation, there will be resistance,'' he
said.
	   Yassin described himself as the head of Hamas' political wing,
and said he did not know about ``the circumstances and resources''
of the group's military arm, Izzedine al Qassam.
	   Despite his criticism of Arafat, Yassin said he would
``cooperate with the Palestinian Authority until we get rid of the
occupation.''
	   However, Yassin spurned Arafat's offers to Hamas to join a new
Palestinian Cabinet he is trying to put together within two weeks.
``We cannot reject the peace accords and implement them at the same
time,'' he said.

Ethiopian exodus still not over, community leaders say 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The exodus of Ethiopian Jews to the
Jewish state is not complete, despite the festive welcome the
government planned for the ``last'' planeload of immigrants
Thursday, community leaders said.
	   Adisso Massala, a legislator of Ethiopian origin, said some
5,000 Ethiopian Jews are still waiting to immigrate to Israel. Most
live in the remote northern city of Gondar, he said.
	   ``How can the prime minister and absorption minister throw a
joyous party when others are left behind?'' Massala said.
	   Israel should open an office in Gondar to facilitate the
immigration of Jews living there, he said.
	   Those scheduled to arrive Thursday night are among the last
Falashmura, or descendants of Ethiopian Jews who converted to
Christianity and are being permitted to immigrate to Israel to be
reunited with relatives already living in the Jewish state.
	   About 60,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel, many brought to
Israel in two dramatic airlifts in 1985 and 1991.
	   Last year, the government decided to close down the Falashmura
transit camp in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and bring its
4,000 residents to Israel.
	   Most of the Falashmura are now in Israel. However, Massala said
some 100 Falashmura are being left behind in Ethiopia so their
Jewish origins can be authenticated.
	   Yossi Sturm, a spokesman for the Jewish Agency which helps bring
immigrants to Israel, said Thursday's arrival of about 60
Falashmura did not close the chapter to immigration from Ethiopia.
	   He said there were estimates that about 2,000 Jews still lived
in remote areas of northern Ethiopia.

Archaeologists report rare finds during Kiev repairs

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Residents may complain that downtown Kiev
looks like a giant construction site, but the city authorities'
decision to launch a major road and communications repair effort
has delighted Ukrainian archaeologists.
	   On Thursday, they were digging right next to the imposing
headquarters of Ukraine's Security Service, once home to the
Ukrainian branch of the fearsome Soviet KGB. Walls of an old
structure were emerging from underground.
	   Archaeologists first zeroed in on the site close to Kiev's most
famous church, the Cathedral of St. Sophia, early this month when
the city dig unearthed the foundations of the 11th century
Irininskaya Church.
	   The church is one of two that archaeologists have been searching
for in Kiev, a religious and cultural center of the Slav people
with more than 1,500 years of history.
	   Scientists welcomed the find but complained that municipal
authorities had nearly destroyed the remains by failing to notify
them in advance about the repair work.
	   After reaching a deal with the city, they continued the dig. The
structure where work was focused Thursday was a chapel erected in
the fist half of the 19th century to commemorate the former
Irininskaya Church, which was destroyed long ago.
	   The chapel, in turn, was largely torn down and covered by
pavement during the era of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, said Ivan
Movchan of the Academy of Sciences' Archaeological Institute.
	   Other finds have included ancient Russian silver jewelry, bronze
candlesticks that could have belonged to Irininskaya, a
turtle-shaped gilded hairpin and dozens of 18th-century copper
coins.
	   This week, at a dig across from St. Sophia, archaeologists found
fragments of an ancient chandelier and a matchbox-sized metal icon
dating back to the 11th-12th centuries and depicting two saints,
the Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``This icon is priceless,'' Serhiy Klymovsky of the Kiev city
history museum told the daily. ``There are no more than 10 such
icons in the museums of Kiev.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The launch of an American satellite on a Russian
booster has been postponed for almost a year, a news agency
reported Thursday.
	   GE American, the owner of the satellite, told its Russian
partners that it wanted to install a new antenna array on the
satellite, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The decision may have been caused by flaws in the old array, or
because GE wanted to modify the satellite for a different orbit,
Interfax said.
	   Because the Russian Proton-K booster rocket built for the launch
has a service life that expires in July of next year, it will be
used instead to launch a Telstar-6 communication satellite for AT
and T Skynet in October, Interfax reported.

Singapore not yet decided on buying American military hardware 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore is considering a dlrs 620 million
purchase of American military equipment but has yet to make a final
decision, the Ministry of Defense said Thursday.
	   In a statement, the ministry said Boeing was one of several
companies to respond to invitations for tenders, but ``the various
proposals are very competitive and we are evaluating them
carefully.''
	   It was responding to local media reports that the U.S. Defense
Department had said Tuesday that the small island republic might
buy eight Boeing-made Apache attack helicopters and other military
hardware.
	   Media reports Thursday said the possible purchase also includes
216 Hellfire II laser-guided missiles, 9,120 Hydra-70 rockets,
chaff dispensers, spare parts, communications equipment, and
training and technical support.
	   The Straits Times said the Apache's competitors include the
French-German Eurocopter Tiger, the South African Rooivalk, and
several Russian models including the Mi-28.
	   The newspaper quoted the U.S. Defense Department as saying in a
statement that the ``sale will contribute to our foreign policy and
security objectives by providing a credible defensive capability to
a key regional friend.''
	   Singapore remains a vocal proponent of continued U.S. military
engagement in Asia, saying that it is an important stabilizing
force.

EU to spend dlrs 11 million to promote dairy products 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union's executive
Commission said Thursday it will spend 10 million European currency
units (dlrs 11 million ) to promote milk and other dairy products
in the 15-nation bloc.
	   The funds will be distributed among 20 organizations in the 15
countries for programs ``promoting consumption in the European
Union and expanding the markets for milk and milk products,'' a
Commission statement said.
	   Some of these organizations include Agrarwirtschaft of Germany,
the Swedish Dairies Association, Britain's National Dairy Council
and Italy's Interprofessione Latte.
	   The Commission said that the prorams are mainly targeted towards
people under the age of 25. ``The idea is that milk should no
longer be something they are given to drink but a drink chosen by
this age group,'' it said.
	   The programs will focus on nutrition - promoting dairy products
as a healthy food providing calcium and vitamins - and projecting a
modern image for milk.

Lawmakers vote to keep Securitate files where they are 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In a sign Romania is not ready to
fully confront its Communist past, lawmakers voted Friday to keep
the estimated 125 million secret police files locked away.
	   The Senate voted 109-7 to keep the files in the vaults of the
Romanian Information Service _ successor to the Securitate secret
police _ and in the interior and defense ministries.
	   The bill now goes to Parliament's lower house.
	   Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, who sponsored another bill proposing
more openness nine years after the end of communism, walked out of
the Senate, calling the vote a ``sham,'' national radio said. He
had been beaten by the Securitate and imprisoned.
	   The Securitate, which spread its tentacles into all walks of
life in Romania's Communist period, documented what people ate,
whom they spoke to and what time someone's wife left for work.
	   Although communism ended in a bloody revolt in 1989, society is
still obsessed about the secret police. One in four adults was
believed to have collaborated, but almost no one has admitted it.
	   Public opinion has been rocked by a recent series of revelations
that ruling politicians, including the health minister, were
Securitate collaborators.
	   Mircea Gheordunescu, deputy director of the Romanian Information
Service, said earlier this week that some 300,000 Securitate files
were destroyed in the 1970s and after 1989.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile gave his ministers until Thursday to
let him know whether they worked for the secret police. He will ask
any former collaborators to resign.

Ethiopian exodus still not over, community leaders say 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The exodus of Ethiopian Jews to the
Jewish state is not complete, despite the festive welcome the
government has planned for the ``last'' planeload of immigrants
arriving Thursday, community leaders said.
	   Adisso Massala, a legislator of Ethiopian origin, said some
5,000 Ethiopian Jews are still waiting to immigrate to Israel, most
in the northern city of Gondar.
	   ``How can the prime minister and absorption minister throw a
joyous party when others are left behind?'' Massala said.
	   Israel should open an office in Gondar to facilitate the
immigration of Jews living there, he said.
	   Those scheduled to arrive Thursday night are among the last
Falashmura, or descendants of Ethiopian Jews who converted to
Christianity and are being permitted to immigrate to Israel to be
reunited with relatives already living in the Jewish state.
	   About 60,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel, many brought to
Israel in two dramatic airlifts in 1985 and 1991.
	   Last year, the government decided to close down the Falashmura
transit camp in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and bring its
4,000 residents to Israel.
	   Most of the Falashmura are now in Israel. Massala said some 100
Falashmura are being left behind in Ethiopia so their Jewish
origins can be authenticated.
	   Yossi Sturm, a spokesman for the Jewish Agency which helps bring
immigrants to Israel, said Thursday's arrival of about 60
Falashmura did not close the chapter to immigration from Ethiopia.
	   He said there were estimates that about 2,000 Jews still lived
in remote areas of northern Ethiopia.

U.S. managers will run Bosnian companies for a year 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Dozens of U.S. businessmen
will run Bosnian companies for a year in order to improve
operations, a Bosnian official was quoted Thursday as saying.
	   Edhem Bicakcic, prime minister of the Muslim-Croat federation,
told the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje that the arrival of U.S.
managers will be an important additional link between the two
countries.
	   Bringing in 30 to 50 U.S. businessmen for a year also will
improve Bosnian companies' prospects on the international market,
he said in Strasbourg, France, en route home from a U.S. visit.
	   Foreign economic and political experts have a leading role in
several transitions under way in post-war Bosnia: from war to
peace, from single-party rule to democracy, and from a
state-controlled to a market economy.
	   Westerners working with local companies complain that Bosnian
businessmen don't understand the market economy and have a
communist mentality.

Book quotes Diana: ``My God, My God'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A new book on Princess Diana's death says a
pedestrian at the car crash scene found the critically injured
princess screaming ``My God, My God'' while photographers snapped
away, according to excerpts published in a French newsmagazine on
Thursday.
	   In ``Investigation on the Death of Diana,'' journalists
Jean-Marie Pontaut and Jerome Dupuis of the magazine l'Express
assembled accounts by witnesses, photographers and officials of the
Aug. 31 crash in a Paris tunnel last year.
	   While photographers shot the wreckage of the black Mercedes, the
book said a pedestrian arrived at the scene, ``one of the first
people to discover it,'' according to the book, excerpts of which
l'Express published Thursday.
	   Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and chauffeur Henri Paul died
from the crash, while bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones survived his
injuries but says he remembers little from the moments before
impact.
	   French investigators are trying to determine to what extend
Paul's drunkenness, the high speed of the Mercedes and the pursuit
by press photographers contributed to the tragedy.
	   The pedestrian, identified only as Belkacem B., said he first
saw driver Henri Paul's hand ``sticking through the windshield. I
saw the passenger in front (Rees-Jones) with his jaw cut and
dangling,'' the book quoted him as saying.
	   Fayed was lying in the back seat, ``his feet dislocated, his
eyes turned up. I saw right away that he was dead.''
	   No knowing who she was at first, the pedestrian saw ``a blonde
woman hunched over with scar on her forehead,'' he said. ``She was
screaming and said a few words in English: `My God, My God,' it
seems to me.''
	   ``I tried to open her door but I couldn't,'' he said. Meanwhile,
the pedestrian said he saw four photographers, one of which told
him to stand away from the car, the book said.
	   There was no immediate comment from investigators about the
book.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Soccer's ruling body has pledged to crack down on
political banners at Iran's final first-round game against Germany.
	   FIFA said it was applying its rules barring political signs or
statements in stadiums evenly to all teams and all viewpoints.
	   Still, special attention would be paid to Thursday's game in
Montpellier, after opponents of the Tehran regime repeatedly
demonstrated in the stands during Iran's 2-1 victory over the
United States last Sunday, with security forces wading in to take
their banners down.
	   ``There will be more stringent measures at the next game
involving that country,'' said FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper.

President-elect Estrada warns of economic problems ahead 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada called
on members of his party Thursday to make sacrifices to show
sincerity as the Philippines continues to suffer from the financial
crisis sweeping Asia.
	   ``Let me warn all that the road ahead will not be easy,''
Estrada, who takes office on June 30, said at swearing-in
ceremonies for about 1,000 charter members of his new party, the
Struggle of the Filipino Masses.
	   ``Aware of the various problems we face, particularly on the
economic front, we are called upon to sacrifice. ... Only by
sacrifice can we demonstrate to our suffering people the strength
of our commitment and the sincerity of our purpose.''
	   Sen. Edgardo Angara, who lost the race for vice president in the
May 11 election, said the financial crisis that has battered
Southeast Asia and South Korea and the recession threatening Japan
``will doubtless make things even more difficult for us here in our
country.''
	   ``The tempest has just begun and there is as yet no light at the
end of the tunnel,'' he added.
	   The Philippine currency has depreciated by as much as 43 percent
since July 1997. The financial crisis has led to closures of
numerous companies, pushing unemployment in April up to 13.3
percent, a seven-year high, from 10.4 percent in the same month
last year.
	   In addition, the El Nino weather phenomenon has wreaked havoc on
agriculture, particularly in the southern Philippines, where
hundreds of thousands are facing a food shortage.
	   Estrada, the current vice president and a former actor, said he
will pursue his campaign promise to eradicate corruption and
establish a favorable business environment through law and order,
judicial and electoral reforms and a stable economic and
legislative framework.
	   ``I will be a listening president, especially to our poor,'' he
said.
	   Estrada's party has brought together stalwarts of the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos' government like business tycoon Eduardo
Cojuangco, who reportedly helped finance Estrada's campaign, and
key leaders of the anti-Marcos opposition.
	   Among the Marcos opponents is congressman-elect Agapito Aquino,
a younger brother of the late Sen. Benigno Aquino, an archrival of
the late dictator who was assassinated by soldiers in 1983. His
sister-in-law, Corazon Aquino, became president after the 1986
``people power'' revolt that toppled Marcos.

Town councilor killed by bomb believed placed by Basque separatists numbers of recent ETA victims, ADDS age of dead councilor

Eds: UPDATES with press conference by Interior Minister, CLARIFIES
<TEXT>
	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A governing party politician was killed
Thursday in an attack authorities blamed on the armed Basque
separatist group ETA just six months after his predecessor was shot
dead by a masked ETA gunman.
	   Manuel Zamarreno, a Popular Party councilor in this northern
Basque town, died from injuries caused by a bomb apparently planted
in a motorcycle parked on a street corner, Interior Minister Jaime
Mayor Oreja said during a press conference in Madrid.
	   The bomb exploded when the councilor and his bodyguard walked by
shortly after 11 a.m. (0900GMT). The bodyguard was also injured,
but his life was not in danger.
	   ``Everything points to this being an ETA attack'' Mayor Oreja
said.
	   Zamarreno, a 43-year-old father of two, replaced Jose Luis Caso
in the Renteria town council last month. Caso was shot dead in a
bar by an ETA gunman on Dec. 11. Both men's lives had been
threatened in graffiti.
	   A third Popular Party councilor from the same town, Concepcion
Gironza, resigned in April when the pressure of being a potential
ETA target became too much.
	   ``He (Zamarreno) knew the risk that he ran, he was fully
conscious of the difficulties'' Mayor Oreja said after condemning
the attack and praising the councilor's bravery.
	   If proved to be the work of ETA, Zamarreno will be the sixth
town councilor linked to the Popular Party killed by the
separatists over the last 12 months, and the fourth so far this
year.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed 800 people since beginning its campaign in 1968 for a
Basque state straddling the Spanish and French border.
	   The group has claimed responsibility for five slayings so far in
1998 _ three town councilors, the wife of one of them, and a
retired Civil Guard officer.
	   Governing party councilors have become ETA's preferred victims
in apparent retaliation for the hard anti-ETA stand of the
conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
	   Over the last year, the government has boasted several major
blows against the separatists. Earlier this month police shot dead
one alleged ETA member during a police raid on a suspected hideout.
	   Following the latest ETA, attack Mayor Oreja reiterated the
government's refusal to consider negotiating an end to the violence
with either ETA or its political wing Herri Batasuna.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's first Japanese department store
announced Thursday it will close its two Hong Kong stores at the
end of the year, throwing more than 300 workers out of work.
	   Daimaru, which has been in Hong Kong for nearly 40 years, is the
latest in a line of major retailers to go out of business since the
region's financial turmoil erupted last year. It is the third
Japanese department store to pull out of Hong Kong since last
November.
	   The company said a slump in personal consumption, fierce
competition, and high rental costs prompted the closure of the Hong
Kong stores, the company's first post-World War II overseas
department outlets.
	   Trade unions said more than 300 employees will be thrown out of
work, Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   As part of a global effort at corporate restructuring, Daimaru
said it will also close its store in France and pull out of a
department store joint venture in Thailand.
	   Daimaru's total losses for the fiscal year ending next Feb. 28
were estimated at 14 billion yen (U.S. dlrs 99 million), about half
of that from the Hong Kong store closures.
	   The company said proceeds from sales of real estate assets and
securities holdings will offset the loss.
	   Last November, Yaohan Department Store closed all of its nine
branches in Hong Kong and one in Macau, throwing 2,700 people out
of work.
	   Another Japanese retailer, Matsuzakaya Co., announced that it
will close its Hong Kong outlet in August after 23 years, putting
nearly 160 people out of work.
	   Last week, Hong Kong officials said unemployment was at a
15-year high of 4.2 percent.
	   The Hong Kong government has come under increasing pressure to
boost the territory's ailing economy, which shrank 2 percent in the
first quarter of the year. Economic contraction in the second
quarter, which is almost certain, would technically put Hong Kong
in recession.

Israel demolishes seven Arab homes in West Bank 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   QATANA, West Bank (AP) _ Israel demolished seven Arab homes in
the West Bank village of Qatana on Thursday, the village leader
said.
	   Dozens of Israeli police sealed off the area as bulldozers
leveled the homes that had been built without licenses.
	   The village, which straddles the line between Israel and the
West Bank, is under full Israeli control and is located near the
Jewish settlement of Har Adar.
	   Village leader Yusif Al Fakih said Israel routinely turns down
requests for building permits in Qatana and that 360 homes in the
village had been built without license. ``We are growing. We need
to build,'' he said.
	   The United States has appealed to Israel to refrain from
unilateral steps, such house demolitions. However, the pace of
demolitions has quickened in recent weeks.

Official: Suspected militants planned to kidnap Americans 
</HEADLINE>
By MARIAM SAMI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police have uncovered a plot by suspected
Islamic militants to kidnap Americans in Egypt and swap them with
jailed extremist leaders, a security source said Thursday.
	   The plot was revealed during investigations into the activities
of 17 men detained earlier this month for attempting to revive
al-Jihad, a militant group, the source said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Al-Jihad had claimed responsibility for the 1981 assassination
of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Rick Roberts said he could not comment on
``security matters.'' Thousands of Americans work in the embassy,
the largest U.S. diplomatic mission in the Middle East, and in the
oil and aid sectors.
	   Islamic militants are critical of the U.S. support for Israel
but they have never targeted Americans during their 6-year-old
campaign to replace Egypt's secular government with strict
religious rule.
	   More than 1,200 people who have died in the violence have been
mostly extremists and security forces.
	   The security source said investigations showed the 17 detainees
wanted to secure the release of Aboud el-Zommor who is serving a
40-year sentence for taking part in Sadat's assassination.
	   They also wanted to free Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is
currently serving a life sentence in the United States. The 57-year
old blind and diabetic sheik was convicted along with nine others
in a plot to blow up the United Nations, a federal building, two
tunnels and a bridge in New York.
	   Another extremist leader that the detainees wanted freed is
Safwat Abdel-Ghani who remains in detention even after completing a
5-year prison term for his role in the Oct. 1990 assassination of
Parliament Speaker Rift el-Mahgoub.
	   No charges have been filed against the 17 men.

Georgia accuses Abkhazia of more burnings, shooting 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Breakaway Abkhazia denied accusations by
pro-Georgian forces on Thursday that separatists were burning
school buildings in deserted villages where ethnic Georgians had
lived.
	   Some 38,000 ethnic Georgian refugees fled Abkhazia's Ghali
region during fighting last month between Abkhazian separatists and
militia groups that support Georgia's central government.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwest Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. The separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   Violence has broken about sporadically since then, despite the
presence of Russian peacekeepers in the region.
	   Dali Dzhodzhua, a spokeswoman for Abkhazia's pro-Georgian
government-in-exile, said Abkhazian separatists have burned school
buildings and principals' homes in seven villages in Ghali that
refugees have deserted.
	   But Amazbey Pchach, internal minister in Abkhazia's separatist
government, denied the report.
	   ``No such things happened there,'' Pchach said.
``Representatives of the government-in-exile in Tbilisi invented
something there, and then started shouting about it to the whole
world.''
	   Pro-Georgian forces and Abkhazian separatists routinely blame
each other for unrest in the region.
	   The Georgian Foreign Ministry said that earlier this week,
separatists fired at two Georgian villages across the border from
Abkhazia. A Georgian police officer dispatched to the scene was
wounded, but no local residents were hurt, the ministry said.
	   The ministry also said that a Georgian refugee, Zhako
Anchabadze, was killed Wednesday, when he returned to his home in
Abkhazia to collect some of his belongings.
	   Pchach, the Abkhazian official, said his government had no
information about the incident, and promised to investigate.
	   Georgia demands that Abkhazia allow an immediate, unconditional
return of the 38,000 refugees who fled last month's fighting.
	   Abkhazia says it needs time to build housing for the refugees,
and wants to screen those who return to make sure they don't
include pro-Georgian guerrillas.

Sugar cubes are relic of biological warfare scheme in World War I 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two cubes of sugar contaminated with anthrax,
discovered recently in Norway and analyzed by British experts,
recall a bizarre German scheme to attack reindeer and horses during
World War I.
	   ``This small but relatively important episode in the history of
biological warfare is one of the few instances of where there is
confirmation of the intent to use a lethal microorganism as a
weapon, albeit 80 years after the event,'' said a report published
Thursday in Nature, the scientific journal.
	   ``It did not, however, make any significant difference to the
course of the Great War.''
	   The two cubes of sugar, each containing a sealed glass container
of anthrax, were discovered recently at the police museum in
Trondheim, the report said.
	   A note attached to the container said: ``A piece of sugar
containing anthrax bacilli, found in the luggage of Baron Otto Karl
von Rosen, when he was apprehended in Karasjok in January 1917,
suspected of espionage and sabotage.''
	   Scientists at the British biological weapons center at Porton
Down confirmed that the cubes contained anthrax, and they said they
were able to revive some spores which had been dormant for 80
years.
	   Von Rosen and his companions were arrested in Karasjok in
northeastern Norway. They were carrying tins of dynamite, labled
``Svea kott'' (Swedish meat), bottles of curare and 19 sugar cubes
which each held a tiny vial of anthrax.
	   Von Rosen claimed to be an activist for Finnish independence,
the Nature report said. His companions, however, said the
expeditions had been organized by Germans with the aim of
disrupting sledge transport of British arms through Norway.
	   Apparently the sugar cubes were to be fed to horses and
reindeer, who would break the anthrax containers as they chewed.
	   ``It is not known whether reindeer eat sugar lumps but
presumably the baron never had the chance to carry out this piece
of research,'' said the report by Caroline Redmon, Martin J. Pearce
and Richard J. Manchee of Porton Down, and Bjorn P. Berdal of the
Norwegian Defense Microbiology Institute.
	   ``Even if all the cubes had been used by the sabotage team it is
unlikely that they would have caused much disruption to
transportation, as anthrax is not transmissible directly from horse
to horse.
	   ``However, if the meat from a dying animal had been consumed
without adequate cooking, it is likely that human fatalities from
gastrointestinal anthrax would have followed,'' the report said.
	   Von Rosen was detained for three weeks, then expelled from
Sweden.
	   ``Unfortunately the complete story was never officially
discovered by the Norwegian authorities,'' the report said.
	   ``It was clear that the baron was involved in acts of sabotage
in Finland but the full nature of the contents of the baron's
'hunting equipment' was not revealed until after his expulsion.''

Sub's main hatch opened for search inside

	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ Navy commandos with welding torches
opened the main hatch of a captured North Korean submarine
Thursday, but delayed their search of its main deck after a warning
that it could be booby-trapped.
	   Officials believed that the sub's crewmen were dead, but were
taking no chances in examining the craft.
	   ``We checked the sub's upper access deck but found no signs of
human life there,'' said Lt. Col. Kim Jong-sook, a spokesman for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
	   Kim said work to open the second hatch leading to the sub's main
hull was temporarily halted on advice from a former North Korean
navy commando who warned that it could be booby-trapped.
	   The search began shortly after the sunken submarine was raised
from 30 meters (110 feet) underwater and towed to shore. Four
car-size air bags were used to lift the submarine to the surface.
	   In the area that was searched, navy officials found two South
Korean-made plastic beverage containers _ a strong indication that
the vessel was returning after dropping or picking up spies.
	   ``What was found in the sub was contrary to a North Korean claim
that the sub was missing while on a routine training mission after
experiencing mechanical problems'' the state KBS-TV said.
	   A day after it was discovered foundering in South Korean waters
with its propeller and periscope entangled in a fishing net, the
North Korean sub sank while being towed to this major naval base on
the east coast. Bad weather delayed the salvage operation.
	   The sub was found in the general area where another, larger
North Korean sub ran aground two years ago. The 1996 incursion
triggered a 53-day manhunt that left 24 North Korean infiltrators
and 13 South Koreans dead. One infiltrator was captured alive and
another was missing and believed to have returned to the North.
	   The captured agent, Lee Kwang Su, was brought to assist in
Thursday's search. He warned that North Korean agents on spy or
commando missions are usually trained to blow up their craft and
commit suicide before being captured.
	   Used primarily to infiltrate spies and conduct surveillance, the
small, 70-ton Yugo-class submarine normally carries a crew of about
six.
	   In Seoul, President Kim Dae-jung reaffirmed that his policy of
engagement toward the communist North would not be swayed by the
discovery of the submarine.
	   ``As shown in the intrusion of our territorial waters by the
North Korean sub, military tensions persist even now on the Korean
Peninsula,'' Kim said in a speech marking the 48th anniversary
Thursday of the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950.
	   ``But the new government will continue to strive to safeguard
peace and expand South-North exchanges and cooperation on the basis
of a firm defense posture and a flexible policy toward the North,''
he said.
	   The sub's intrusion was a serious test of the so-called
``sunshine policy'' of Kim's government, which was inaugurated in
February with a pledge to open up the reclusive North through
expanded civilian contacts and cooperation.
	   Opposition politicians and some newspaper editorials have
criticized Kim for not taking a harder line with North Korea
following the sub's discovery.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Israel demolishes seven Arab homes in West Bank 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   QATANA, West Bank (AP) _ Israel demolished seven Arab homes in a
West Bank village on Thursday, the village leader said.
	   Dozens of Israeli police sealed off the village of Qatana as
bulldozers leveled the homes that had been built without licenses.
	   Qatana, straddling the line between Israel and the West Bank, is
under full Israeli control and is located near the Jewish
settlement of Har Adar.
	   Village leader Yusif Al Fakih said Israel routinely turns down
requests for building permits in Qatana and that 360 homes in the
village had been built without license. ``We are growing. We need
to build,'' he said.
	   The pace of demolitions has quickened in recent weeks, despite a
U.S. appeal to refrain from unilateral steps.

Ukrainian border guard kills five comrades 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to ADD new details on shooter.
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian border guard stationed in
Crimea shot and killed five of his comrades Thursday and then
disappeared from his unit, officials said.
	   The shooting occurred early in the morning at a border guards'
base near the Crimean town of Alupka on the Black Sea, the Defense
Ministry said. Those killed included an officer, a sergeant and
three soldiers, it said.
	   Crimea's Interior Ministry identified the attacker as Vadim
Sobko, and said he escaped into nearby mountains with his
Kalashnikov rifle and ammunition, it said.
	   Border guards and interior troops backed by Security Service
agents were looking for the soldier, who was drafted last fall, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   Shootings have become frequent in the often demoralized and
poorly funded armies of the former Soviet republics, especially in
neighboring Russia.
	   Many shootings are blamed on hazing, which is common in the
armed forces of the former Soviet Union and involves physical and
psychological abuse of recruits by older servicemen.
	   In 1997, five people were killed and 44 others were disabled in
143 hazing episodes in the Ukrainian military, which has about
400,000 servicemen, according to military prosecutors. In January
1998, a private at a missile base shot two other servicemen to
avenge hazing and then killed himself.

Lawmakers vote to keep Securitate files where they are 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In a sign Romania is not ready to
fully confront its Communist past, lawmakers voted Friday to keep
the estimated 125 million secret police files locked away.
	   The Senate voted 109-7 to keep the files in the vaults of the
Romanian Information Service _ successor to the Securitate secret
police _ and in the interior and defense ministries.
	   The bill now goes to Parliament's lower house.
	   Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, who sponsored another bill proposing
more openness nine years after the end of communism, walked out of
the Senate, calling the vote a ``sham,'' national radio said. He
had been beaten by the Securitate and imprisoned.
	   Public opinion has been rocked by a recent series of revelations
that ruling politicians, including the health minister, were
Securitate collaborators.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile gave his ministers until Thursday to
let him know whether they worked for the secret police. He will ask
any former collaborators to resign.
	   Mircea Gheordunescu, deputy director of the Romanian Information
Service, said earlier this week that some 300,000 Securitate files
were destroyed in the 1970s and after 1989.
	   The Securitate spread its tentacles into all walks of life in
Romania's Communist period, documenting what people ate, whom they
spoke to and what time someone's wife left for work.
	   Although communism ended in a bloody revolt in 1989, Romanians
are still obsessed about the secret police. One in four adults was
believed to have collaborated, but almost no one has admitted it.

Catholic leaders pursue talks as shells batter Bissau delete dated material. No pickup.

<TEXT>
	   BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ The thunder of war ripped through
the abandoned streets of Bissau. A daily ritual for most of the
month, the desolate city awoke Thursday to another barrage of
rockets and thudding artillery shells.
	   What began as an attempted coup weeks ago has deteriorated into
a deadly slug fest between Guinea-Bissau's breakaway military and
President Joao Bernardo Vieira's loyalist troops and their
Senegalese allies.
	   With Bissau now virtually empty, the war is slowly eating away
at the city's meager infrastructure. Homes and small buildings are
scarred by rocket fire, streets are deserted but for patrols of
nervous troops.
	   On Bissau's northern outskirts at the Bra military garrison,
rebel forces are dug in, Russian-made cannons sit at the ready
while the rebel junta plot their next move.
	   ``The junta is a highly organized military group, a highly
competent army,'' says junta spokesman Maj. Manuel Dos Santos
Fereira Mendes. ``Don't listen to what anybody says.''
	   What Senegal's military command said last week _ that their
troops had retaken Bra and had the rebels on the ropes _ has since
proven false.
	   To the contrary, the military junta is clearly in control of Bra
and beyond. A journalist visiting the military garrison saw
evidence of fighting in the area, but only dead Senegalese soldiers
lay nearby.
	   ``The enemy tried to take up positions near us, but we pushed
them back with fire from our heavy weapons,'' Mendes told The
Associated Press.
	   The bravado and war talk came as church leaders began a second
day of mediation efforts with both sides of the conflict in hopes
of at least halting the daily artillery battles that early sent the
vast majority of Bissau's 300,000 population in flight.
	   Rotting corpses lay in the streets from earlier fighting,
despite efforts by aid groups to dispose of the potentially
disease-bearing bodies.
	   The Roman Catholic Bishop of Bissau, who met Wednesday with a
rebel delegation at Safin, was on Thursday seeking with leaders of
local Muslim and Evangelical communities to hold talks with the
embattled Vieira. There was no confirmation of a meeting.
	   Bishop Septimio Ferrazeta described his meeting with the
renegade delegation as ``very positive'' but said ``no great
progress'' had been made.
	   The heavily-armed rebels number more than 2,000 men, Mendes told
reporters Thursday. Guinea-Bissau's military before the fighting
had about 3,500 soldiers.
	   In the countryside, more and more people are lending their
support to rebel leader Brig. Ansumane Mane. Former independence
war revolutionaries are donning their old uniforms and taking up
checkpoint positions along the country's two main highways.
	   Mane is a veteran guerilla fighter from the colonial war against
Portuguese rule that ended with 1975 independence. Mane has not
been seen by outsiders since the revolt erupted.
	   Senegal has deployed some 1,500 troops to support the
government.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ In a visit widely seen as a show of
solidarity with Greek Cypriots, Greek President Constantinos
Stephanopoulos arrived Thursday in the war-divided Mediterranean
island of Cyprus.
	   The visit was the first to Cyprus by a Greek head of state since
the island gained independence from Britain in 1960. It comes at a
time of increased saber-rattling between Cyprus and Turkey, which

25-year sentence for man convicted of IRA bombing in London 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP ) - A man convicted of an Irish Republican Army
bombing that killed two men and caused huge damage in London's
Docklands district was sentenced to 25 years in prison Thursday.
	   James McArdle, 29, of Crossmaglen, Northern Ireland, was
convicted of conspiring to cause explosions. He was specifically
accused in the Feb. 9, 1996 truck-bombing in London which marked
the end of the IRA cease-fire declared in 1994.
	   The IRA went on to set off a massive explosion in the center of
Manchester before calling a second cease-fire in July.
	   Judge John Kay discharged the jury of three women and nine men
from returning verdicts on charges that McArdle murdered Inam
Bashir and John Jeffries _ the two newspaper sellers killed in the
blast _ because of what prosecutor John Bevan described as a
``clear and flagrant contempt'' in a national newspaper report
Thursday.
	   Details of the contempt were not given.
	   McArdle admitted driving the vehicle transporter used in the
bombing on two occasions in Britain, but said he believed the
transporter was simply to bring back cars to Northern Ireland. On
the second trip, he claimed he had handed over the vehicle to
another driver outside London.
	   McArdle acknowledged he supported the IRA but said he deplored
the bombing as ``wicked,'' and saying he was sad when he learned
that the cease-fire had ended.
	   The judge said he accepted that McArdle did not intend to kill
or cause serious injury. ``Nor did you personally appreciate the
risks of this conspiracy.''
	   ``However, objectively there was a substantial risk of both
death and injury and this conspiracy did in fact result in two
deaths and many injuries, some of such severity that the victims'
lives will be permanently marred,'' the judge said.
	   ``The conspiracy resulted in damage in excess of 150 million
pounds (dlrs 250 million) and engendered terror and misery for many
many people.''

Eds: UPDATES with press conference by Interior Minister, CLARIFIES
<TEXT>
	   RENTERIA, Spain (AP) _ A governing party politician was killed
Thursday in an attack authorities blamed on the armed Basque
separatist group ETA _ just six months after his predecessor was
shot dead by a masked ETA gunman.
	   Manuel Zamarreno, a Popular Party councilor in this northern
Basque town, died from injuries caused by a bomb apparently planted
in a motorcycle parked on a street corner, Interior Minister Jaime
Mayor Oreja said at a press conference in Madrid.
	   The bomb exploded when the councilor and his bodyguard walked by
shortly after 11 a.m. (0900GMT). The bodyguard was also injured,
but his life was not in danger.
	   ``Everything points to this being an ETA attack'' Mayor Oreja
said.
	   Zamarreno, a 43-year-old father of two, replaced Jose Luis Caso
in the Renteria town council last month. Caso was shot dead in a
bar by an ETA gunman on Dec. 11. Both men's lives had been
threatened in graffiti.
	   A third Popular Party councilor from the same town, Concepcion
Gironza, resigned in April when the pressure of being a potential
ETA target became too much.
	   ``He (Zamarreno) knew the risk that he ran, he was fully
conscious of the difficulties'' Mayor Oreja said after condemning
the attack and praising the councilor's bravery.
	   Zamarreno would be the sixth town councilor linked to the
Popular Party killed by the separatists over the last 12 months,
and the fourth so far this year.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom,
has killed 800 people since beginning its campaign in 1968 for a
Basque state straddling the Spanish and French border.
	   Governing party councilors have become ETA's preferred victims,
in apparent retaliation for conservative government of Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar's tough anti-ETA stand.
	   The government has recently boasted major blows against the
separatists. Earlier this month police shot dead one alleged ETA
member during a police raid on a suspected hideout.

British European affairs minister meets Ukrainian leaders 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A British minister pressed Ukraine on
Thursday to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and speed up
economic reforms.
	   European Affairs Minister Douglas Henderson held talks in Kiev
with Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk, deputy premier Serhiy Tigipko
and Security Council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin.
	   Henderson expressed hope that Ukraine would honor its pledge to
close Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident, by
2000.
	   Ukraine links the planned closure to dlrs 1.2 billion in
international funds for the construction of two new reactors to
compensate for Chernobyl's lost power and ease the blow to its
workers.
	   Henderson said he hoped the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development would finance the construction.
	   Henderson said Britain was worried about the stalled economic
reforms in Ukraine, adding that British investors would like to see
a more attractive investment climate and more ``transparent'' laws
and regulations, the Interfax news agency reported.

Lawmakers vote to keep Securitate files secret minister's dismissal

Eds: UPDATES with reaction, more detail, president signs health
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In a sign Romania is not ready to
fully confront its Communist past, lawmakers voted Friday to keep
the estimated 125 million secret police files locked away where
they are.
	   Under the legislation, which still has to pass Parliament's
lower house, people will theoretically have access to their own
personal files.
	   The Senate voted 109-7 to keep the files in the vaults of the
Romanian Information Service _ successor to the Securitate secret
police _ and in the interior and defense ministries.
	   Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, who sponsored another bill proposing
more openness nine years after the end of communism, walked out of
the Senate, calling the vote a ``sham,'' national radio said. He
had been beaten by the Securitate and imprisoned.
	   ``I felt the bitter taste of betrayal,'' said Dumitrescu, in
tears, adding that the law won't grant access because people who
keep the files still have Communist mentalities.
	   President Emil Constantinescu signed a paper Thursday agreeing
to the dismissal of Health Minister Francisc Baranyi, who last week
admitted working for the Securitate.
	   The Securitate, which spread its tentacles into all walks of
life in Romania's Communist period, documented what people ate,
whom they spoke to and what time someone's wife left for work.
	   Although communism ended in a bloody revolt in 1989, society is
still obsessed about the secret police. One in four adults was
believed to have collaborated, but almost no one has admitted it.
	   Public opinion has been rocked by a recent series of revelations
that ruling politicians minister, were Securitate collaborators.
	   Mircea Gheordunescu, deputy director of the Romanian Information
Service, said earlier this week that some 300,000 Securitate files
were destroyed in the 1970s and after 1989.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile gave his ministers until Thursday to
let him know whether they worked for the secret police. He will ask
any former collaborators to resign.

Official: Suspected militants planned to kidnap Americans 
</HEADLINE>
By MARIAM SAMI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police have uncovered a plot by suspected
Islamic militants to kidnap U.S. citizens in Egypt and swap them
with jailed extremist leaders, a security source said Thursday.
	   The plot was revealed during investigations into the activities
of 17 men detained earlier this month for attempting to revive
al-Jihad, a militant group, the source said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Al-Jihad had claimed responsibility for the 1981 assassination
of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Rick Roberts said he could not comment on
``security matters.'' Thousands of Americans work in the embassy,
the largest U.S. diplomatic mission in the Middle East, and in the
oil and aid sectors.
	   Islamic militants are critical of the U.S. support for Israel
but they have never targeted Americans during their 6-year-old
campaign to replace Egypt's secular government with strict
religious rule.
	   The more than 1,200 people who have died in the violence have
been mostly extremists and security forces.
	   The security source said investigations showed the 17 detainees
wanted to secure the release of Aboud el-Zommor who is serving a
40-year sentence for taking part in Sadat's assassination.
	   They also wanted to free Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is
currently serving a life sentence in the United States. The 57-year
old blind and diabetic sheik was convicted along with nine others
in a plot to blow up the United Nations, a federal building, two
tunnels and a bridge in New York.
	   Another extremist leader that the detainees wanted freed is
Safwat Abdel-Ghani, who remains in detention after completing a
5-year prison term for his role in the Oct. 1990 assassination of
Parliament Speaker Rift el-Mahgoub.
	   No charges have been filed against the 17 men.

World Cup: Baggio dreams of world title, following bitter disillusions 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Penalty shootouts twice dissolved Roberto
Baggio's dream of winning the world title. In his third and last
World Cup, Italy's veteran star forward hopes to get the prize
without going to the penalty spot.
	   ``I have been dreaming so long about the world title, and I
failed twice after coming very close to it. Now I'll try again. I
hope not to suffer another bitter disillusion, because this is my
last chance,'' Baggio said at Italy's training camp Thursday.
	   The 31-year-old striker, taken to France as a substitute for
younger star Alessandro Del Piero, has been a key to Italy's
qualification for the second round, scoring two goals and making
decisive moves.
	   Baggio played a full match and tallied a late equalizer in the
first-round opener against Chile, in the absence of Del Piero who
was nursing a right thigh strain.
	   Baggio was rotated with his former Juventus teammate in the next
two games against Cameroon and Austria because Del Piero still was
in questionable form after recovering from his injury.
	   ``Every player wants to be in the starting 11, and I'm no
exception. But I'm aware this is Del Piero's World Cup and I must
be patient. Alex is expected to rival Ronaldo in France and it's
fair for him to show himself,'' Baggio explained.
	   As Del Piero still seems unable to play a full match, the
successful Baggio-Del Piero combination was expected to be
continued in Saturday's match against Norway in Marseille.
	   ``There is no rivalry, there are no secret pacts with Alex. Our
common goal is to go as far as possible with the team. I will do my
best,'' Baggio explained.
	   Baggio earned a last-minute call on the Italian team after
scoring a personal record of 22 goals in the Italian league with
low-ranked Bologna. He said he was playing his third World Cup
because of his stubbornness.
	   ``I worked hard to come here, and I am working hard to win the
title, at last,'' Baggio said.
	   His impressive performances in the last Serie A season earned
Baggio a rich two-year contract with Inter Milan, where he will be
teaming with Brazilian star Ronaldo.
	   One of the highest-scoring Italian strikers with 316 goals in
151 league matches, Baggio debuted on the Italian national team in
1988 and has tallied 27 goals in 49 games with the ``Azzurri.''
	   In the 1990 World Cup Baggio helped Italy to take third place,
following elimination by Argentina in a penalty shootout in the
semifinals.
	   Four years later Baggio's decisive goal vaulted Italy to the
finals. But it was a miss by Baggio from the penalty spot which
contributed to causing Italy's loss to Brazil in another World Cup
shootout.
	   ``I already kicked (and converted) a penalty against Chile in
this World Cup. I certainly thought of the mistake (in the Pasadena
final) four years ago as I prepared to kick. I hope not to go
through shootouts again,'' Baggio said.
	   Beginning with the second round, matches go to extra time in
case of ties. If the teams remain tied after the additional time,
penalties will be kicked to decide the team moving to the next
round.
	   Baggio, whose career has been jeopardized by serious knee
injuries, said he was used to overcoming difficult times and has
learned to ``fight my way uphill.''
	   ``Luckily everything went smoothly so far. If we reach the
quarterfinals then we can think to make it to the final. The
important point is to give your all on the field. If you have done
your best you can lose without regrets.''

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In a sign Romania is not ready to
fully confront its Communist past, lawmakers voted Friday to keep
the estimated 125 million secret police files locked away.
	   The Senate voted 109-7 to keep the files in the vaults of the
Romanian Information Service _ successor to the Securitate secret
police _ and in the interior and defense ministries.
	   Under the legislation, which still has to pass Parliament's
lower house, people will theoretically have access to their
personal files.
	   Constantin Ticu Dumitrescu, who sponsored another bill proposing
more openness nine years after the end of communism, walked out of
the Senate, calling the vote a ``sham,'' national radio said. He
had been beaten by the Securitate and imprisoned.
	   ``I felt the bitter taste of betrayal,'' said Dumitrescu, in
tears, accusing the people who keep the files of having Communist
mentalities.
	   President Emil Constantinescu signed a paper Thursday agreeing
to the dismissal of Health Minister Francisc Baranyi, who last week
admitted working for the Securitate _ the latest revelation of
Securitate collaboration among ruling ministers.

Book quotes Diana: ``My God, My God'' 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: CORRECTS to moaning sted screaming, ADDS details
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A new book on Princess Diana's death says a
pedestrian at the car crash scene found the critically injured
princess moaning ``My God, My God'' while photographers snapped
away, according to excerpts published in a French newsmagazine on
Thursday.
	   In ``Investigation on the Death of Diana,'' journalists
Jean-Marie Pontaut and Jerome Dupuis of the magazine l'Express
assembled detailed accounts by witnesses, photographers and
officials of the Aug. 31 crash in a Paris tunnel last year.
	   While photographers shot the wreckage of the black Mercedes, the
book said a pedestrian arrived at the scene, ``one of the first
people to discover it,'' according to the book, excerpts of which
l'Express published Thursday.
	   Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and chauffeur Henri Paul died
from the crash, while bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones survived his
injuries but says he remembers little from the moments before
impact.
	   French investigators are trying to determine to what extent
Paul's drunkenness, the high speed of the Mercedes and the pursuit
by press photographers contributed to the tragedy.
	   The pedestrian, identified only as Belkacem B., said he first
saw driver Henri Paul's hand ``sticking through the windshield. I
saw the passenger in front (Rees-Jones) with his jaw cut and
dangling,'' the book quoted him as saying.
	   Fayed was lying in the back seat, ``his feet dislocated, his
eyes turned up. I saw right away that he was dead.''
	   Not knowing who she was at first, the pedestrian saw ``a blonde
woman hunched over with scar on her forehead,'' he said. ``She was
moaning and said a few words in English: `My God, My God,' it
seemed to me.''
	   ``I tried to open her door but I couldn't,'' he said. Meanwhile,
the pedestrian said he saw four photographers, one of whom told him
to stand away from the car, the book said.
	   The witness was quoted as saying the photographer then told him
to direct oncoming traffic away from the wreckage.
	   Belkacem B. was quoted as saying he heard Diana moaning when the
photographer tried to take her pulse.
	   The book also quoted a photographer on the scene who said
Frederic Mailliez, the first doctor to arrive on the scene and
treat Diana, believed she would survive the accident.
	   Mailliez was quoted as describing the princess as ``unconscious
but showing no signs of injury except for a cut on her forehead.''
	   There was no immediate comment from investigators about the
book.

China invites Taiwanese negotiator 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In a major stride toward ending a
three-year impasse, China invited Taiwan's top negotiator Thursday
to visit for discussions on a formal resumption of talks.
	   China invited Koo Chen-fu to meet with Wang Daohan, his Chinese
counterpart, in Shanghai in September or October, said a letter
from China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.
	   They would discuss conditions for restarting talks between the
two sides, the ARATS letter said.
	   Koo is chairman of ARATS' Taiwanese counterpart, the Straits
Exchange Association. The semi-official organizations are the
negotiating bodies between the sides, which don't recognize each
other and have no official contacts.
	   Koo was also invited to tour coastal Fujian province, where most
Taiwanese trace their roots, along with the cities of Beijing,
Nanjing and Xian, the letter said.
	   It also invited SEF Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow, who would
preside over lower-level talks, to accompany Koo, and suggested a
visit to Taiwan next month by an ARATS vice secretary-general.
	   China suspended talks between the groups in 1995 in anger over
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States, a trip
it considered proof he was abandoning the stated goal of
reunification between the sides. The freeze came as the
organizations were planning a second meeting between Koo and Wang.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven off the
mainland by Communist forces in 1949. Koo and Wang's initial
meeting in Singapore in 1993 was the first open contact between the
sides since then.
	   After suspending talks, China demanded that Taiwan, which it
considers a renegade province, agree to directly discuss
reunification as a precondition for their resumption. It has since
dropped those calls.
	   Taiwan wants to return to the practical issues, including
resolution of fishing disputes and repatriation of hijackers, that
were discussed in several rounds of lower-level talks before the
freeze.
	   ARATS and the SEF began exchanging letters late last year, and
the ice was broken with a visit to Beijing by SEF Vice
Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng in April.

World Cup: Japan, Jamaica seek first World Cup win AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Oh, the celebrations that will take place if
the game doesn't end in a draw.
	   World Cup debutants Japan and Jamaica will meet Thursday in a
match that is relatively meaningless in the grand scheme of things
at France 98. Both teams lost their first two games, and neither
has a chance of making it to the second round.
	   But, for both teams _ and for both sets of spirited fans who
ventured in masses across thousands of miles to support a losing
cause _ it's a chance like no other to grab that first-ever World
Cup victory before heading home.
	   ``For the Jamaicans and Japanese, it's not a move to the next
round _ it's a move to the next century,'' Jamaica coach Rene
Simoes said. ``We aim to end this World Cup in a very good way,
therefore the players should enjoy themselves.''
	   Japan especially has pride on the line. As co-host of the 2002
World Cup with South Korea, the Japanese want to justify the
tournament's first trip to Asia. The four representatives from the
world's most populous continent collectively lost their first seven
games in France.
	   ``We have to win,'' midfielder Shinji Ono said. ``The other
teams are looking down upon Asia.''
	   Jamaica's fans have donned the country's red, black and green
colors and have turned the World Cup into a lively party wherever
they've traveled. They danced and sang in the stands during the
team's 3-1 defeat to Croatia and the 5-0 blowout against Argentina.
	   Maybe Japan's supporters haven't been as noisy, but they've been
just as fervent. And there would be many more of them here had not
12,000 of their countrymen become victims of the massive ticket
fraud scandal that has affected fans from several countries.
	   ``The Japanese and Jamaican people should be proud of their
teams,'' Simoes said. ``Because they are on the biggest stage in
the world, and even though they have not qualified, they've done
well.''
	   Japan has been the better team through its first two games, with
very respectable 1-0 losses to both Argentina and Croatia. The
players feel if they can just get that one goal, it would make a
world of difference.
	   ``If we can score first,'' defender Naoki Soma said, ``we can
play a different kind of game.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A balcony holding more than 100 spectators
collapsed Thursday onto the crowded floor of a sports stadium in
southern Russia, killing at least 16 people, officials said.
Twenty-three others were injured.
	   The accident occurred about 11:40 a.m. (0740 GMT) during the
Russian national wrestling competition, when a 50-meter-long
(160-foot-long) balcony fell about 5 meters (16 feet) onto the
spectators underneath, said Col. Alik Betrozov of the local branch
of Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   Rescue workers were trying to locate additional victims who may
be trapped beneath the debris.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in the southern city of Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers
(850 miles) south of Moscow.
	   A government commission was created to determine the cause of
the accident.
	   A stadium official who refused to give his name said faulty
construction was suspected to have caused the accident. He said
about 3,000 spectators were in the stadium at the time of the
collapse.
	   Shoddy construction is endemic in Russia, where funds for
construction and maintenance of public buildings have all but
disappeared since the Soviet collapse.

Arab League condemns Israel's plans to extend Jerusalem authority 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Thursday condemned
Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem's boundary, calling it an
attempt to ``eliminate the Arab identity of east Jerusalem.''
	   The 22-member league also warned in a statement that the
implementation of the plans will ``destroy the (Middle East) peace
process and put the entire area on the brink.'
	   The meeting was called by the Palestinians to discuss the
Israeli blueprint for Jerusalem that would annex several suburbs to
expand the city's boundaries.
	   ``This is a very dangerous decision and will have grave
consequences,'' the statement said.
	   The league said it will ask the U.N. Security Council to discuss
the Israeli move, describing it as a violation of U.N. resolutions
and international law.
	   The Israeli Cabinet said the decision, announced this month, is
aimed at strengthening ties between Jewish settlements and
Jerusalem.
	   But it has infuriated Palestinians who want to set up the
capital of their would-be state in east Jerusalem, which Israel
occupied in the 1967 Middle East War.

	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ Welcomed to China with an ancient ceremony
used for emperors, U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday he
would pursue closer ties with Beijing despite criticism back home.
	   ``As two great nations, we have a special responsibility to the
future of the world,'' Clinton said after receiving a golden key
for the city of Xi'an, first stop on a nine-day trip.
	   Pursuing the East-West relationship he called vital to peace and
stability in the 21st Century, Clinton took his first opportunity
here to answer critics who urged him not to visit Beijing.
	   ``There may be those here and back in America who wonder whether
closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are
good,'' he said. ``Clearly the answer is yes. We have a powerful
ability to help each other grow. We can learn much from each other.
And as two great nations, we have a special responsibility to the
future of the world.''

Majority stake in Lithuanian Telecom sold to Swedish-Finnish consortium  VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A majority stake in Lithuanian Telecom, the largest state company ever auctioned off by Lithuania's government, has been sold to a consortium set up by Sweden's Telia and Finland's Sonera, the Baltic News Service reported Thursday. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   The decision to offer Lithuania's telecommunications giant to
the Swedish-Finnish consortium was made by privatization officials
and confirmed by the government late Wednesday, BNS said.
	   The consortium, called Amber Teleholding, will receive a
60-percent stake e in Lithuanian Telecom at a price of dlrs 510
million. The Swedish and Finnish buyers will also pump in another
dlrs 221 million of investments over the next two years, according
to the report.
	   The Swedish-Finnish consortium beat out Danish Tele Danmark,
which was also in the running.
	   The sale is considered fulfillment of a promise by the country's
conservative government, which came to power in late 1996 vowing to
speed up large-scale privatization.
	   There were demonstrations in the country earlier in the year by
Lithuanians who feared the privatization of Lithuanian Telecom
would lead to steep rises in phone costs. Others said such a large
infrastructure company should be kept entirely in Lithuanian hands.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The United States will give Lebanon two
grants of dlrs 840,000 to help it improve operations and revenues
of the national electricity company, officials said Thursday.
	   The two grant agreements were signed Thursday by Lebanese
minister of electricity and hydraulic resources, Elias Hobeika, and
the U.S. Ambassador in Beirut, Richard Jones, a statement issued by
Hobeika's office said.
	   One grant of dlrs 340,000 will help the country's national
electricity company, Electricite du Liban, to improve the system of
issuing and collecting customers' bills.
	   The other grant of dlrs 500,000 is designed to finance a
detailed feasibility study on supplying the country's major power
plants with natural gas, the statement said.
	   Ambassador Jones said the grants will also assist the Lebanese
government in ``switching from reliance on polluting, expensive
sources of electricity to a more affordable, environment-friendly
source of electricity _ liquefied natural gas.''
	   ``These grants will also pave the way for valuable cooperation
and technology transfers from top U.S. companies in the energy
sector,'' he added.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon and Tunisia have signed
agreements to guarantee investments and to avoid dual taxation as
part of an overall protocol of cooperation between the two
countries.
	   This was announced on Wednesday at a news conference following a
meeting between Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Bweiz and his
Tunisian counterpart, Saeed Bin Mustafah.
	   Mustafah arrived in Beirut late Tuesday from neighboring Syria.
	   Bweiz said the agreements were aimed at encouraging the private
sectors in the two countries and boosting their economic and
political ties.
	   On the political side, Mustafah reaffirmed his country's support
for Lebanon's position on the Mideast peace process that calls for
a concurrent solution of the south Lebanon and Syria's Golan
Heights issues with Israel.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover further dropped
on the Amman Stock Market this week, a market report said Thursday.
	   Brokers attributed the sluggish activity to political
instability in the region, and the retreat in trading with

	   The market report reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday said the 60-company general share prices index
declined by 2.65 percent to 167.05 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks slipped by 3.14 percent, industrial
firms by 2.19 percent, services sector by 0.06 percent, while
insurance sector nudged up by 0.91 percent.
	   Turnover declined by 6.9 percent to 4.84 million Jordanian

operate on offshore basis in Cyprus, the Central Bank said
Thursday.
	   Societe Generale S.A. has operated on the island since February

Financial products.
	   The newly licensed unit will only deal in foreign currency and

to four the number of administered offshore banking units on the
island, which operate alongside 28 offshore banking units and five
representative offices.
	   Cyprus in 1975 introduced tax breaks, duty free privileges and
other perks to attract offshore businesses in a bid to rebuild its
economy hit by Turkey's 1974 invasion and the loss of resources in
the northern third of the island occupied by the Turks.

Russian nuclear experts deny report of nuclear contamination threat region, last 3 grafs.

Eds: UPDATES with report of improperly stored waste in Vladimir
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Nuclear officials denied accusations by an
environmental lawyer Thursday who warned of contamination from
radioactive water pumped underground for decades by a Russian
chemical plant.
	   The denials came in response to an article in the Moscow Times
saying that Russia's Tomsk-7 chemical and nuclear complex has been
pumping liquid radioactive waste into groundwater since 1963. The
report cited Tomsk environmental lawyer Konstantin Lebedev.
	   Lebedev told the paper that the radioactive waste 280 meters
(yards) to 400 meters (yards) underground could contaminate
drinking water. He has filed suit asking to have the plant's
pumping license revoked.
	   Dr. Andrei Rybalchenko, head of a research laboratory at the
Russian Institute for Industrial Design, which controls industrial
waste disposals, said the lawyer's claims are groundless.
	   The pumping has been taking place for 38 years, he said, and
inspections by geologists and environmentalists have found no
contamination of the region's land or drinking water.
	   The waste is pumped through insulated shafts, and the
underground reservoir is surrounded by water-resistant clay that
keeps the contaminated water from seeping through.
	   Observation shafts have been drilled to monitor radiation levels
in the layers above and below the waste dumps. No increase has been
registered, Rybalchenko said.
	   The radioactive waste water may begin to seep into neighboring
layers in 800 to 1,000 years, Rybalchenko said. But by then the
level of radiation would be too low to present any danger, he said.
	   Tomsk-7 is a formerly secret city of 110,000 containing five
nuclear reactors about 10 miles from Tomsk, the provincial capital
of 500,000. It is located 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) east of
Moscow.
	   Meanwhile, government experts reported improperly stored nuclear
waste in the Vladimir region, 160 kilometers (100 miles) east of
Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   The Vladimir region dumps had been used to store equipment
contaminated during cleanup operations at the Chernobyl nuclear
power plant, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   After a government commission sounded an alarm six months ago,
the machinery was removed, but contaminated dirt at the former
storage sites has remained, deputy chief of the Vladimir regional
committee for environmental protection Valery Bryukhanov was quoted
as saying.

Three convicted murderers hanged in Japan 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Amnesty International condemnation
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three convicted murderers were hanged Thursday in
Japan's first executions in nearly a year, news media reported.
	   Although executions require an order from the justice minister,
officials at the ministry always refuse to confirm or comment on
them.
	   Japan has now executed 28 criminals since 1993, when the death
penalty was resumed after more than three years of suspension, said
the media reports, citing informed sources that they did not name.
	   In the last previous executions, four people were hanged last
August, the reports said.
	   They said Shinji Shimazu, 66, was hanged at a Tokyo prison. He
had been sentenced to death for a murder and robbery in 1983 while
on parole from a life sentence in another murder-robbery case, the
reports added.
	   Two others were executed at a prison in Fukuoka, southwestern
Japan, they said.
	   Masahiro Muratake, 54, was convicted of killing his wife and two
other people in 1978, and Yukihisa Takeyasu, 66, murdered a woman
in 1980 while he was on parole from a sentence for another murder
committed in 1956, the reports said.
	   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said
all three had complained that they were not informed of their right
to see a lawyer, and Takeyasu maintained that he had confessed
under duress.
	   ``The death penalty system in Japan is extremely cruel,'' the
group said in a statement. ``Prisoners are held in prolonged
solitary confinement for years on end with little opportunity for
contact with anyone except prison guards. Executions are carried
out without the knowledge of families or lawyers and apparently in
an arbitrary fashion.''
	   The group's Mark Allison said, ``Instead of persisting with its
flagrant abuses of human rights, the government should be joining
the international trend for the abolition of the death penalty.''
	   The government has said it refrains from comment on executions
out of deference for the survivors of the crimes and the families
of those put to death.
	   Critics, however, say officials are simply afraid of opening the
process to scrutiny.
	   Though executions are never publicly announced, relatives and
lawyers can confirm a convict's fate later by checking whether the
person's name has been crossed off registration lists at government
offices.

Retransmitting Majority stake in Lithuanian Telecom sold to Swedish-Finnish consortium 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A majority stake in Lithuanian
Telecom, the largest state company ever auctioned off by
Lithuania's government, has been sold to a consortium set up by
Sweden's Telia and Finland's Sonera, the Baltic News Service
reported Thursday.
	   The decision to offer Lithuania's telecommunications giant to
the Swedish-Finnish consortium was made by privatization officials
and confirmed by the government late Wednesday, BNS said.
	   The consortium, called Amber Teleholding, will receive a
60-percent stake e in Lithuanian Telecom at a price of dlrs 510
million. The Swedish and Finnish buyers will also pump in another
dlrs 221 million of investments over the next two years, according
to the report.
	   The Swedish-Finnish consortium beat out Danish Tele Danmark,
which was also in the running.
	   The sale is considered fulfillment of a promise by the country's
conservative government, which came to power in late 1996 vowing to
speed up large-scale privatization.
	   There were demonstrations in the country earlier in the year by
Lithuanians who feared the privatization of Lithuanian Telecom
would lead to steep rises in phone costs. Others said such a large
infrastructure company should be kept entirely in Lithuanian hands.

XI'AN, China: new China.'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Air Force One touched down in sweltering Xi'an, where crowds of
evening onlookers lined the streets along his route to the old
walled city amid the modern one. Security was tight; Chinese
authorities stationed water cannons in side streets nearby.
	   The extravagant ceremonial welcome at the South Gate of the Old
City began a presidential mission disputed at home, a sendoff
marred by formal diplomatic protest after China barred three radio
reporters for Radio Free Asia, a U.S. government broadcaster
nettling to Beijing.
	   During the long journey to China, Clinton said he will be
striving for the advancement of political and human rights, an
issue rankling a Congress divided over his policy of cordial
engagement and investigating his prior deals with Beijing.
	   Of the growing controversy over technology exports, Beijing's
foreign ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said Thursday that
cooperation on satellite launches ``benefits both sides. Those who
are in the mainstream of bilateral relations should have a correct
view.''
	   Tang dismissed U.S. investigations as ``a wave of noise in the
United States that is intended to obstruct the development of
bilateral relations with the United States. We believe it by no
means represents the attitude of most American people.''
	   Clinton views his nine-day mission to China, the first by an
American president since George Bush's in February 1989, as the
right way to increase America's impact on human rights, nuclear
weapons spread and efforts to stabilize shaken Asian economies.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' Clinton said
at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, where his plane stopped to
refuel.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' he told about 4,000 people
who turned out to see him on his way.
	   But even as Clinton flew to China, Chinese police arrested two
dissidents in a display of Beijing's hard line against
pro-democracy activists.
	   Clinton's first stop Thursday was Xi'an, the ancient walled
capital. The gritty industrial city surrounding it now was primped,
painted and flag-decked for Clinton's arrival.
	   On Friday, Clinton goes to the village of Xia He for what is
billed as a roundtable discussion with ordinary Chinese citizens
about their lives in a changing society. He'll speak in the village
square. Then Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, are
tourists for an afternoon, visiting the unearthed terra cotta
warriors, pottery soldiers fashioned to guard an emperor in the
afterlife.
	   Then to Beijing on Saturday, opening with the event that has
stirred the greatest controversy at home: a formal welcoming in
Tiananmen Square, scene of the democracy demonstrations bloodily
repressed by Chinese troops in June 1989.
	   Clinton defends his decision to go to that symbolic site as
protocol, not substance, and said he will speak America's piece for
human rights and freedom. But not there; no speeches at Tiananmen.
	   The president said it would be wrong for him to demand that the
Chinese change the way they welcome world leaders to Beijing, but
``equally wrong for me to go there and take no notice of the
continuing difficulties with human and political rights.''
	   So he said he will do both, the latter, probably, in an address
at Beijing University on Monday.
	   Critics at home, however, kept up the pressure. The House voted
late Wednesday to include in a dlrs 250 billion defense spending
bill a provision that would bar the Pentagon from buying any
product manufactured by the Chinese government or its army.
	   Separately, a senior Pentagon adviser, Peter Leitner, said he
believed business interests had been allowed to override national
security concerns in deals with China.
	   The weekend is the actual summit with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, the joint meetings of U.S. and Chinese officials and the
state banquet at the Great Hall of the People. Clinton and Jiang
are to dine privately Sunday evening.
	   But ceremonies and state visits did not shroud the discordant
notes of U.S.-China relationships. That was dramatized when the
Chinese canceled visas for three reporters of Radio Free Asia, a
U.S.-financed operation that beams broadcasts here, jammed by the
Beijing government.
	   Clinton countered by granting the three a White House interview,
saying the Chinese government made a big mistake, and that ideas do
not need visas. He said he supported Radio Free Asia, not against
the Chinese government but for the advancement of freedom of speech
and debate.

Talks underway but coalition not in sight 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Talks on the future government
continued for the second day Thursday, but formation of a stable
coalition still appears to be weeks away.
	   The leader of the Social Democrats, Milos Zeman met with the
Christian Democrat's leader Josef Lux Thursday to try and figure
out how the two parties could work within the same Cabinet.
	   Zeman's party won last week's elections, but have only 74 seats
in the 200-seat legislature, and lacks obvious center-left allies
that could give him a majority needed to form a government.
	   ``At this stage, we are discussing different coalition
combinations,'' Zeman told Czech radio after the meeting. ``Some of
them are acceptable, some are not.''
	   Negotiations for the future Cabinet began almost immediately
following the elections _ held two years early in a vain attempt to
overcome a political deadlock _ but are expected to take weeks.
	   While Zeman is leaning towards a minority two-party government
with the center-right Christian Democrats, Lux fears that in such a
scenario, the government could fall hostage to the old-guard
Communists.
	   The Communists are the third strongest with 24 seats, but all
four remaining parties have rejected them as coalition partners,
due to their past and lack of will to reform.
	   Communist leader Miroslav Grebenicek has repeatedly said his
party could support a coalition of Social Democrats and Christian
Democrats.
	   Lux therefore wants also the Freedom Union of Jan Ruml to join
Zeman's government.
	   ``In such a grand coalition ... we would defend right-wing
values, as is usual in grand coalitions,'' Lux told the radio.
	   But Ruml has so far rejected such an idea. His party seems to
prefer a center-right government formed with Lux and the election
runner-up, Civic Democratic Party of former Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a stable coalition,
President Vaclav Havel will likely ask Klaus to attempt the same.
Klaus' party won 63 seats in the elections.
	   Zeman was scheduled to meet Ruml later in the day Thursday. He
plans to inform Havel of progress made also Thursday.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ With a 21-gun salute, the HMS Invincible
arrived in the Baltic port city of Gdynia on Thursday, the first
visit of a British Royal Navy aircraft carrier to Poland and the
first in more than 40 years to the Baltic Sea.
	   Poland has been invited to join the NATO in April 1999. The HMS
Invincible took part in a two-day exercise with a Polish submarine
and aircraft on the Baltic before sailing into Gdynia for a
five-day visit.
	   The 18-year-old British ship will highlight 80th anniversary
celebrations for Poland's Navy.
	   On Sunday, the nine Sea Harrier planes and 12 Sea King
helicopters aboard the ship will participate in an air show with
military aircraft from eight other countries, including the United
States and Russia.
	   Meanwhile, the fleets of Denmark, Germany and Poland will sign
an agreement on joint exercises, mutual visits and improving the
knowledge of English.
	   Three German ships _ the Lindau, Pegnitz and Bevensen _ are
docked in the western military port of Swinoujscie. The Danish ship
Lindormen is expected Friday.

Italy's Communists say Prodi's coalition will keep governing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Two days after refusing to back the government in
voting for NATO's eastward expansion, Premier Romano Prodi's
Communist allies indicated Thursday they were committed to keeping
the government in place.
	   ``It is necessary and possible to maintain, or rather
strengthen, the agreement between our democratic forces,'' said
Armando Cossuta, the No. 2 of the Communist Refoundation party.
``Otherwise, it would be a triumph for the opposition.''
	   The Communists, who usually give Prodi the majority he needs in
the Chamber of Deputies, on Tuesday voted against NATO's eastward
enlargement, forcing the premier to rely on votes from an
opposition centrist party.
	   The split prompted Prodi's center-left partners to schedule a
meeting next week to see if they can develop a more united front.
On Wednesday, Prodi said he saw no other alternative to his
coalition partners, and that either the consultations would result
in a renewed show of support from the Communists or the end of the
coalition.
	   Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti insists that despite
differences on NATO his group would support Prodi in any confidence
vote, making any near prospect for a government collapse unlikely.
	   Prodi has rejected opposition requests that he resign for
failing to have full backing from the government's regular
supporters.
	   Italy's president on Thursday urged the governing coalition to
overcome their differences.
	   ``The Constitution and common sense require a strong majority,''
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the head of state, said during a
ceremony in Sardinia.
	   ``They require that everyone perform an act of humility ... to
maintain a commitment,'' made to the people who elected the
government parties two years ago, Scalfaro added.

Chernomyrdin: Government dismissal severely set back Russian economy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said
Thursday the dismissal of his government was a key cause of
Russia's economic distress along with the Asian financial crisis
and the slide in world oil prices.
	   Chernomyrdin spoke at a wide-ranging news conference that
covered themes from the prospects for impeaching President Boris
Yeltsin to the future of Russia's natural resource monopolies, the
country's biggest potential earners and biggest tax debtors.
	   Chernomyrdin said that if his government were still in power,
``there wouldn't be such a desperate situation as there is now,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``The market reacts even to (the smallest) announcement, and in
this case the whole government was sent packing,'' he was quoted as
saying. The result was that the consequences of the Asian crisis
and world oil price slide coincided with the two-month absence of
an effective government in Russia, he said.
	   Yeltsin fired Chernomyrdin and his entire Cabinet in March and
replaced them with a new, younger team ordered to move faster on
economic reforms.
	   Chernomyrdin predicted that the government would not break up
energy companies such as electricity giant Unified Energy systems
and Russia's biggest company, the Gazprom gas monopoly, which he
used to head and in which he is believed to hold a significant
stake.
	   ``This is the best system in the world. Why should it be
destroyed?,'' Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying.
	   As to his successor Sergei Kiriyenko's austerity program,
Chernomyrdin said it was a stronger version of his own Cabinet's
plan, including stricter deadlines and targets, Interfax reported.
	   Chernomyrdin said that Yeltsin's impeachment would be
counterproductive, since it would go against the consolidation of
forces now needed in Russia to combat the crisis.
	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament has voted to
set up a commission to prepare an impeachment motion against
Yeltsin, but the motion is not expected to get any farther than
previous, failed attempts.

China fine-turning democratic elections in its villages 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: `Doji Cering' correct on second and subsequent references
By RENEE SCHOOF
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ As U.S. President Bill Clinton headed to China
with a promise to promote freedom and human rights, the Chinese
government showcased its own version of democracy: village
elections.
	   For the past 10 years, China has allowed its 900 million farmers
_ three-quarters of the population _ to elect village officials who
decide how public money is spent and implement national policies
like restricting families to one or two children.
	   China has no plans to allow direct elections at any higher
levels than its 1 million villages. The national village election
law was passed as an experiment, reflecting doubts in 1988 about
allowing any direct popular elections at all.
	   But today the Communist Party and government strongly back
village elections because they have proved successful in smoothing
relations between villagers and government officials, Doji Cering,
the minister of civil affairs, said at a briefing.
	   Elections have helped promote faster economic growth by bringing
in leaders who can best guide development, he said.
	   Clinton, who has said he hoped his trip would help promote
democracy, plans to meet Friday with villagers near Xi'an to learn
about life in China's changing countryside.
	   Communist leaders decided at a party congress last fall to
support improvements in village elections, and lawmakers are
studying revisions to the elections law to improve election
procedures and oversight of officials.
	   ``The elections have received a great deal of attention and
support from the party and government'' and are ``warmly received
by the broad masses of farmers,'' Doji Cering said.
	   Most villages have already had three elections, and some are
holding their fourth.
	   Officials from the Ministry of Civil Affairs have been training
local officials in fair election procedures. Villagers meet on
election day to listen to speeches and take turns casting secret
ballots.
	   All villages now have more than one candidate for every post,
and candidates are nominated by the villagers, instead of by
higher-level officials as had been done in some areas in the past,
Doji Cering said.
	   About 70 to 80 percent of all candidates are Communist Party
members, and many non-members are recruited by the party after they
are elected, according to ministry officials.
	   Communist Party members are ``advanced elements'' who naturally
win the support of China's 900 million farmers, but they get no
preferential treatment, the civil affairs chief said.
	   Corruption persists in a minority of villages, but elections
help weed out officials who take advantage of their positions, he
added.
	   ``Ordinary people in the villages can see most clearly who are
the corrupt elements,'' he said.

Northern Ireland voters go to polls with bomb attack fresh in mind 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES grafs 10-11 with Ahern appeal
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's people on
Thursday chose a new government which, if it works, will bring both
sides of this long-divided society together as never before.
	   And even as 1.18 million eligible voters were being given the
chance to implement this key plank of the Belfast peace agreement,
the Irish Catholics and British Protestants of one shattered
village were already working together _ picking their way through a
familiar sea of rubble and glass shards following a bombing.
	   Wednesday's car bomb in Newtownhamilton wounded a 13-year-old
boy, wrecked shops and roofs, tore iron walls off of a fortified
police barracks _ the supposed target _ and forced authorities to
move polling booths away from the devastation.
	   ``This might make people more determined to vote, but the people
I've been talking to feel very down, very depressed that this
should happen again,'' said Conor Murphy, watching a trickle of
voters come and go at the relocated polling station in
Newtownhamilton High School.
	   Murphy is the local candidate for the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, which would traditionally defend such bombings as necessary
to expel British forces from Northern Ireland. But Wednesday's
attack was claimed by the Irish National Liberation Army, an
anti-British gang opposed to the larger Irish Republican Army's
11-month-old truce.
	   Ballots will be counted all day Friday and possibly into
Saturday to determine how many seats each party will hold in the
new 108-member Assembly. More than a dozen parties and independents
are fielding 296 candidates.
	   Police in flak jackets stood guard at the more than 1,200
polling stations across Northern Ireland.
	   Activists from several parties also kept watch _ in hopes of
identifying supporters of rival parties using fake identification
or false addresses to cast several votes, a chronic problem in
elections here.
	   The outcome will do much to determine whether the peace
agreement, struck in April among eight parties after 22 months of
negotiations, will succeed or unravel.
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern in Dublin appealed for
northerners to deliver ``a massive vote for those candidates who
stand for peace.''
	   ``I think most of the candidates do,'' Ahern said.

U.S. disappointed with access to Japan's construction market 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Four years after Japan launched a plan to open its
huge market for government-funded construction projects, American
companies' access remains minimal, a U.S. Commerce Department
official said Thursday.
	   U.S. and Japanese trade officials ended two days of talks
Thursday over implementation of a 1994 Japanese construction action
plan requiring competitive bidding for large-scale projects.
	   ``It's hard to explain the disappointing results,'' said Marjory
Searing, acting director-general of the Commerce Department.
	   Architectural design and construction companies based in the
United States won dlrs 50 million in projects in Japan over a
one-year period ending this month, half the amount received the
previous year, Searing said.
	   In the trade talks, Japanese officials rejected a U.S. request
to help foreign companies increase their access by easing rules
permitting only three partners in joint venture bids for public
works, she said.
	   Japanese officials were unavailable for comment.
	   Investment on construction projects plays an important role in
the Japanese economy, accounting for about 20 percent of gross
national product. State-funded projects accounted for almost half
of the 83 trillion yen (dlrs 589 billion) spent on construction
investment in 1996, according to Japanese Construction Ministry
statistics.
	   American construction companies typically have about 20 percent
of the world market outside Japan, but only 0.015 percent of the
Japanese market, according to the U.S. government figures.
	   ``I think that's slightly unfair,'' Searing said.

Greek president in Cyprus in show of solidarity strengthening defense pact.

Eds: UPDATES with Cypriots welcoming president, quotes on
AP Photos Available
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek President Constantinos
Stephanopoulos arrived in Cyprus Thursday on the first visit by a
Greek head of state to this war-divided Mediterranean island.
	   The visit is seen as a show of Greek solidarity with Greek
Cypriots at a time of increased saber-rattling between Cyprus and
Turkey, which backs the island's breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   ``This is one of the most important moments in my life. This is
not a typical diplomatic visit but a visit of love, honor and
affection,'' Stephanopoulos said in an emotional arrival statement.
	   The Greek leader, whose red carpet welcome at Larnaca airport
was carried live on television and radio, was received by Greek
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and his entire Cabinet.
	   Thousands of Greek Cypriots, waving Greek and Cypriot flags,
cheered Stephanopoulos as his motorcade passed through Larnaca and
later the capital, Nicosia.
	   Stephanopoulos is a figurehead and his office is largely
ceremonial but his four-day visit has prompted Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel to begin a visit to the Turkish-Cypriot part of
Cyprus next week.
	   ``The presence in Cyprus of the Greek president sends an
important message, a message that says Greece is here to defend
Cyprus' democracy and justice and our efforts to join the European
family,'' Clerides said.
	   Turkey, a fellow NATO member of Greece and its traditional
rival, invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974. A
Turkish Cypriot state declared in the north in 1983 is recognized
only by Ankara and Clerides' government remains the only
internationally recognized administration on the island.
	   Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been living apart since the
invasion, with a U.N.-patrolled line running across the island
separating them. Repeated international efforts to reunite the
island have so far failed.
	   ``I'll visit all the areas of free Cyprus and take the love of
the Greek people to them,'' Stephanopoulos said.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Cyprus rose last week following the
visits by Turkish and Greek warplanes to the island nation in a
show of force.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus while Greece
and the Cypriot government are bound by a 1993 defense pact.
Stephanopoulos said the pact would be discussed.
	   ``We will examine the possibility of a qualitative improvement
of the joint defense doctrine, which must be reinforced so long as
the aggressiveness of Turkey remains,'' he said in Larnaca.
	   But he added that he was not the bearer of ``aggressive or
hostile messages. I will leave that task to others,'' he said.
	   Greece, which has a decades-old dispute with Turkey over rights
in the Aegean sea, has repeatedly stated its intention to fight
alongside its Greek Cypriot allies if hostilities break out on the
island.
	   Such a possibility increased after Turkey threatened military
action to stop the planned deployment in October of Russian-made
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles that the Clerides government has
purchased from Russia.

Four Malaysian opposition leaders quit party posts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Four senior opposition leaders
have resigned from their posts, saying their party's top leadership
was barring people from speaking out, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Earlier this month, a rift opened up in the Democratic Action
Party, Malaysia's most vocal opposition group, after three senior
officials were sacked for repeatedly accusing their party chief,
Lim Kit Siang, of promoting his son.
	   ``We resigned as we had been perceived as obstacles,'' Teoh Teik
Huat, chairman of the party's branch in the northern state of
Penang, was quoted as saying in Thursday editions of The Star
daily.
	   Nevertheless, he said he would remain a member of the DAP.
	   Separately, Lim told reporters he would not expel anyone
campaigning to oust him during the party's general elections in
August as long as branch delegates voted to do so ``in a democratic
way.''
	   If the DAP splits or weakens, it could effectively erode the
little political opposition that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
faces. Lim and his son, both members of Parliament, are among the
few who openly criticize Mahathir, whose administration has ruled
Malaysia for 17 years.
	   The younger Lim has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for
printing a pamphlet that questioned the Southeast Asian country's
political system.

World Cup: Police question ticketing agency officials 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Paris police Thursday detained for questioning four
senior officials at Prime Sports International, a U.S. company at
the center of a World Cup ticket fraud probe.
	   The four officials, who police refused to identify, are being
questioned after the company reported the burglary of 15,000 World
Cup tickets from its Paris office last week.
	   PSI said that thieves had scaled a heater and broken into a safe
that contained the tickets.
	   But World Cup organizers quickly questioned the burglary, saying
that while PSI listed tickets for last week's match between France
and Saudi Arabia match among those stolen, a check at the Stade de
France found the seats occupied with the tickets' buyers.
	   One of 17 World Cup-approved travel agencies, PSI was already
under investigation after a Madrid travel agency complained that it
never received the 1,000 tickets it bought from PSI.

Kuchma denies plans to disband parliament amid speaker election saga 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma denied
speculation Thursday that he plans to disband his country's new
parliament, which he has accused of being ``paralyzed'' and failing
to address the country's economic woes.
	   ``There were hotheads who suggested that parliament be
disbanded,'' Kuchma told a conference of regional newspaper
editors. ``But dragging Ukraine into another parliamentary election
would not be either politically or economically feasible.''
	   There has been speculation that Kuchma would call new elections
after watching Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, squabble
for weeks over the election of a speaker.
	   The new Rada, dominated by leftists and centrists, was elected
in March and began working in mid-May, but has been unable to
choose a speaker or turn its attention to pressing matters.
	   In a nationwide address a week ago, Kuchma accused the
parliament of failing to deal with the economic crisis facing
Ukraine. He also signed a package of emergency economic decrees _
thus bypassing parliament _ and said Thursday he was preparing more
such measures.
	   Kuchma, whose attempts at market reforms have long been stalled
by the Rada, expressed hope that the deadlock in parliament would
soon be resolved.
	   The parliament was scheduled to hold a 12th vote for speaker
later Thursday. Previous votes have been blocked by various
parliamentary factions over demands that the entire parliamentary
leadership leadership be elected at once and other political
issues.
	   The parliament also voted 236-1 on Thursday to form a commission
to investigate allegations of bribery during previous votes for a
speaker. The scandal erupted Wednesday when leftists accused their
opponents of offering dlrs 10,000 bribes to influence the election
outcome.

She likes a man in uniform _ too much 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish woman likes men in uniform _
so much that she patted a policeman's fanny and got fined 300
kroner (dlrs 43).
	   Ulla Isendam said she saw officer Henrik Basse one day and
couldn't resist ``his cute little bum,'' the newspaper Berlingske
Tidende reported Thursday.
	   Basse was affronted and took the 28-year-old woman to the local
police station in Hilleroed, 35 kilometers (22 miles) north of
Copenhagen, and charged her with injury to his integrity and
indecent behavior.
	   Basse sued her for 5,000 kroner, basing the amount on awards
given to three female police officers who had been similarly
handled. But the Hilleroed town court imposed a lower fine.
	   The fine may have depleted Isendam's wallet, but hasn't stilled
her blood.
	   ``I still get turned on by men in uniforms so I guess I can't
resist tapping more behinds in the future,'' the newspaper Ekstra
Bladet quoted her as saying.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A balcony holding more than 100 spectators
collapsed Thursday onto the crowded floor of a sports stadium in
southern Russia, killing 23 people, officials said. Thirty-nine
others were injured.
	   The accident occurred at about 11:40 a.m. (0740 GMT) during the
Russian national wrestling competition, when a 50-meter-long
(160-foot-long) balcony fell about 5 meters (16 feet) onto the
spectators underneath, said Col. Alik Betrozov of the local branch
of Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry.
	   By mid-afternoon rescue workers had finished searching the
rubble, believing they had found all those killed or wounded in the
fall.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in the southern city of Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers
(850 miles) south of Moscow in the Kabardino-Balkaraya republic.
	   A government commission was created to investigate the cause of
the accident.
	   Aleksander Khashkhovov, assistant to Kabardino-Balkaraya
president Valery Kokov, said the collapse occurred because the
stadium was old.
	   But a stadium official who refused to give his name said faulty
construction was suspected to have caused the accident. He said
about 3,000 spectators were in the stadium at the time of the
collapse.
	   Shoddy construction and poor maintenance are endemic in Russia,
where funds for construction and repair of public buildings have
all but disappeared since the Soviet collapse.

Princess Diana's brother says he intended no attack on royals 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: 5th-8th grafs, UPDATES with comment on memorial garden
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's brother, says he
did not intend to attack anyone in the now-famous eulogy at her
funeral in which he swore that her ``blood family'' would help
ensure her sons were not simply immersed in duty and tradition, but
that their souls could sing.
	   Asked by a BBC-TV interviewer if he was surprised that the
eulogy was interpreted as a criticism of the royal family, he said,
``I wasn't taking swipes at anyone.''
	   ``Diana brought to their lives something quite different and
wonderful and I was just offering in any way that her surviving
family could help to perpetuate that,'' he said during a
documentary on the Spencer family home, where he is about to open a
museum exhibition on Diana. The documentary was broadcast Wednesday
night.
	   ``I'm pleased that I said what I said for Diana. And judging
from the letters I get from the public _ I got 200,000 letters,
people were in agreement that it needed to be said,'' he said.
	   That public adulation of Diana inspired a government commission
to propose creating a memorial garden near Kensington Palace,
Diana's home. The palace was a focus of public grieving after hear
death, with mounds of flowers accumulating at the gates.
	   The memorial garden, however, is not popular with many local
residents. Conservative lawmaker Alan Clark says the plan to take
over a large part of Kensington Gardens ``and transmogrify it into
a commemorative garden in memory of Diana contains all the
ingredients of the new dumbed-down millennium culture.''
	   Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer and chairman of
the advisory committee, said Thursday that Kensington Palace would
be a focus of public attention no matter what.
	   ``If five million people are going there then the gardens are
going to be affected anyway,'' Brown said. ``We have got to put
them in good state _ it is going to be simple, it is going to be
dignified, it is not an attempt to spend the lots of money on
ornate gardens.''
	   In his interview, Earl Spencer said he didn't know members of
the royal family ``on a level of any significance'' except for his
two nephews and said he was ``certainly not going to sit here and
criticize their relatives.''
	   He also dismissed claims that his sister was set to marry Dodi
Fayed, who died in the Aug. 31 Paris car crash with her. Spencer
said their relationship had not gone past the ``heady stage.''
	   The earl said claims made by Fayed's father, Harrods department
store owner Mohamed Al Fayed, that the couple were engaged the
night they were killed were ``ridiculous.''
	   He said he and his family were not aware of any plans for
marriage.
	   ``It is speculation as to what might have happened or what might
not have happened. It is completely ridiculous,'' he said.

Youths in commotion outside Myanmar opposition leader's house 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Security officials in the Myanmar
capital on Thursday confronted 50 youth members of an opposition
party trying to make their way to the home of party leader Aung San
Suu Kyi, a government statement said.
	   Details of the incident were unclear, but a Western diplomat in
the capital, Yangon, said some sort of commotion broke out in front
of Suu Kyi's house as she tried to escort the youths in.
	   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said his
embassy had heard that Suu Kyi had fallen to the ground at one
point during the incident, but was quickly back on her feet and
uninjured.
	   If true, it would be the first known time since 1996 that Suu
Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her pro-democracy
work, had been placed in a position of direct physical danger.
	   In November 1996, a mob attacked Suu Kyi's motorcade, smashing
car windows with sticks and crowbars and slightly injuring one of
her top aides. Some members of the mob identified themselves to
journalists as members of a pro-government organization and said
they had been paid by the government.
	   The youths involved in Thursday's incident were believed to have
been headed to attend a study group meeting held every other
Thursday at Suu Kyi's house. The government has tolerated such
meetings for several months, though it does not allow Suu Kyi to
meet with such large gatherings of people outside her compound.
	   A fax from a spokesman for the military government, received in
Bangkok, said the youths ``tried to push their way in through the
security checkpoint'' on University Avenue Road near Suu Kyi's
house.
	   ``The incident took place when the security officials on duty at
the checkpoint refused the group entry on security grounds and
requested them to leave,'' it said, adding that their were no
arrests.
	   The statement did not say if there had been any violence, or if
the students were finally admitted to Suu Kyi's compound.
	   Neither Suu Kyi nor other leaders of her party could be
contacted. Suu Kyi has said that the government often cuts her
phone line, and a call to one of her colleagues was abruptly cut
off after several seconds.
	   In an unusually confrontational statement Tuesday, Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy demanded that the military regime
convene by Aug. 21 the pro-democracy Parliament elected in 1990 but
never allowed to meet.
	   The demand marked the first time Suu Kyi's party has set a
deadline for the military to convene Parliament. It was unclear
what would happen if the ruling council of generals refused to
comply, as is likely.
	   The military _ which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma,
since 1962 _ refused to honor the result when it became clear that
pro-military parties lost.
	   Suu Kyi, who vaulted to prominence during anti-government
protests in 1988 that were bloodily suppressed, has been under
house arrest or close confinement for most of the last nine years.
Hundreds of her supporters are in jail.

Greek president in Cyprus in show of solidarity strengthening defense pact.

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ In a demonstration of solidarity as
tension between Cyprus and Turkey increases, Greek President
Constantinos Stephanopoulos arrived Thursday on a state visit by to
this war-divided Mediterranean island.
	   The Greek leader, whose red carpet welcome at Larnaca airport
was carried live on television and radio, was received by Greek
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and his entire Cabinet.
	   Stephanopoulos, the first Greek head of state to visit the
island since its independence from Britain in 1960, is a figurehead
and his office is largely ceremonial _ but his four-day visit has
prompted Turkish President Suleyman Demirel visit the
Turkish-Cypriot part of Cyprus next week.
	   ``This is one of the most important moments in my life,''
Stephanopoulos said in an emotional arrival statement. ``This is
not a typical diplomatic visit but a visit of love, honor and
affection.''
	   Thousands of Greek Cypriots, waving Greek and Cypriot flags,
cheered Stephanopoulos as his motorcade passed through Larnaca and
later the capital, Nicosia.
	   ``The presence in Cyprus of the Greek president sends an
important message, a message that says Greece is here to defend
Cyprus' democracy and justice and our efforts to join the European
family,'' Clerides said.
	   Tensions between Turkey and Cyprus rose last week following the
visits by Turkish and Greek warplanes to the island nation in a
show of force. Turkey has threatened military action to stop the
planned deployment in October of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles that the Clerides government has purchased from Russia.
	   Turkey, a fellow NATO member of Greece and its traditional
rival, invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been living apart since the
invasion, with a U.N.-patrolled line running across the island
separating them. Repeated international efforts to reunite the
island have so far failed.
	   A Turkish Cypriot state declared in the north in 1983 is
recognized only by Ankara and Clerides' government remains the only
internationally recognized administration on the island.
	   ``I'll visit all the areas of free Cyprus and take the love of
the Greek people to them,'' Stephanopoulos said.
	   Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus while Greece
and the Cypriot government are bound by a 1993 defense pact.
Stephanopoulos said the pact would be discussed.
	   ``We will examine the possibility of a qualitative improvement
of the joint defense doctrine, which must be reinforced so long as
the aggressiveness of Turkey remains,'' he said in Larnaca.
	   But he added that he was not the bearer of ``aggressive or
hostile messages. I will leave that task to others,'' he said.
	   Greece, which has a decades-old dispute with Turkey over rights
in the Aegean sea, has repeatedly stated its intention to fight
alongside its Greek Cypriot allies if hostilities break out on the
island.

By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ Welcomed with ancient pageantry, President
Clinton began his journey through China today, declaring that a
commitment to human dignity and freedom is as ``vital to the
strength and success'' of this nation as it is in America.
	   Clinton came to pursue at the summit, at village roundtables,
with communists and with stockbrokers the East-West relationship he
calls crucial to peace and stability in the 21st century.
	   He had said he would be striving for the advancement of
political and human rights, an issue rankling a Congress divided
over his policy of cordial engagement and investigating his prior
deals with Beijing. A reminder of that political stress _ six
members of Congress, all Democrats, traveled with him, on an
invitation the administration said Republicans spurned.
	   Thus, the extravagant ceremonial welcome at the South Gate of
the Old City of Xi'an opened a presidential mission disputed at
home. Even the sendoff was marred by formal diplomatic protest
after China revoked visas to bar three reporters for Radio Free
Asia, a U.S. government broadcaster nettlesome to Beijing.
	   Clinton spoke first of U.S.-China accord, not discord. ``We
Americans admire your accomplishments, your economy, your hard work
and vision, your efforts against hunger and poverty, your work with
us on peace and stability in Korea and South Asia,'' Clinton said.
	   Then the polite lecture:
	   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' he told a throng in the old city. ``In this global
information age, where both economic growth and equal opportunity
are based on ideas, a commitment to providing all human beings the
opportunity to develop their full potential is vital to the
strength and success of the new China as well.''
	   As for the critics, Clinton said: ``There may be those here and
back in America who wonder whether closer ties and deeper
friendship between China and America are good.''
	   ``Clearly, the answer is yes,'' he said. ``We have a powerful
ability to help each other grow.''
	   Clinton delighted the crowd by opening his speech with a few
words of Chinese: ``Ni, hao ma?'' _ which means ``Hello, how are
you?'' He closed by saying ``Thank you'' in Chinese.
	   Air Force One landed in the murky dusk of a city shrouded by
chronic smog. At the formal welcoming rites, giant red-globe
lanterns reflected in the floodlights along the 200-yard, broad red
carpet that was Clinton's path to his greeting.
	   It was a rainbow scene of gowns, costumes, elaborate headdresses
of dynasties long past, of customed as warriors parading to bow to
the president, of dancers waving banners and scarlet globes on
lofty staffs, all amid the music of gongs, flutes and drums.
	   The pageant was styled an ``emperor's welcome,'' after rituals
dating from the 7th century rulers of imperial China. Xi'an Mayor
Feng Xichu presented Clinton the ceremonial gold key to the city.
	   But there was no easing the controversy, as a congressional
committee in Washington heard testimony on alleged leaks of U.S.
missile technology to China, while a Beijing official defended the
satellite deals involved.
	   The foreign ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said today that
cooperation on satellite launches ``benefits both sides. Those who
are in the mainstream of bilateral relations should have a correct
view.''
	   Tang dismissed U.S. investigations as ``a wave of noise in the
United States that is intended to obstruct the development of
bilateral relations with the United States. We believe it by no
means represents the attitude of most American people.''
	   Clinton views his nine-day mission to China, the first by an
American president since George Bush's in February 1989, as the
right way to increase America's impact on human rights, nuclear
weapons spread and efforts to stabilize shaken Asian economies.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' Clinton said
at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, where his plane stopped to
refuel.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' he told about 4,000 people
who turned out to see him on his way.
	   But even as Clinton flew to China, Chinese police arrested two
dissidents in a display of Beijing's hard line against
pro-democracy activists.
	   The gritty industrial city surrounding Xi'an was primped,
painted and flag-decked for Clinton's arrival.
	   On Friday, Clinton goes to the village of Xia He for what is
billed as a roundtable discussion with ordinary Chinese citizens
about their lives in a changing society. He'll speak in the village
square. Then Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, are
tourists for an afternoon, visiting the unearthed terra cotta
warriors, pottery soldiers fashioned to guard an emperor in the
afterlife.
	   Then to Beijing on Saturday, opening with the event that has
stirred the greatest controversy at home: a formal welcoming in
Tiananmen Square, scene of the democracy demonstrations bloodily
repressed by Chinese troops in June 1989.
	   Clinton defends his decision to go to that symbolic site as
protocol, not substance, and said he will speak America's piece for
human rights and freedom. But not there; no speeches at Tiananmen.
	   The president said it would be wrong for him to demand that the
Chinese change the way they welcome world leaders to Beijing, but
``equally wrong for me to go there and take no notice of the
continuing difficulties with human and political rights.''
	   So he said he will do both, the latter, probably, in an address
at Beijing University on Monday.
	   Critics at home, however, kept up the pressure. The House voted
late Wednesday to include in a dlrs 250 billion defense spending
bill a provision that would bar the Pentagon from buying any
product manufactured by the Chinese government or its army.
	   Separately, a senior Pentagon adviser, Peter Leitner, said he
believed business interests had been allowed to override national
security concerns in deals with China.
	   The weekend is the actual summit with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, the joint meetings of U.S. and Chinese officials and the
state banquet at the Great Hall of the People. Clinton and Jiang
are to dine privately Sunday evening.
	   But ceremonies and state visits did not shroud the discordant
notes of U.S.-China relationships. That was dramatized when the
Chinese canceled visas for three reporters of Radio Free Asia, a
U.S.-financed operation that beams broadcasts here, jammed by the
Beijing government.
	   Clinton countered by granting the three a White House interview,
saying the Chinese government made a big mistake, and that ideas do
not need visas. He said he supported Radio Free Asia, not against
the Chinese government but for the advancement of freedom of speech
and debate.

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ In one of the biggest attacks this year,
Lebanese guerrillas detonated two bombs in an ambush Thursday,
killing two Israeli soldiers and wounded four in southern Lebanon.
	   The predawn attack near the border in the Israeli-occupied zone
came as Israel and Lebanon prepared to exchange the remains of an
Israeli soldier for Lebanese prisoners and slain guerrillas.
	   The violence was not expected to scuttle the deal.
	   Thursday's attack occurred near Houla, 1.6 kilometers (one mile)
from the Israeli border and about 50 kilometers (31 miles)
southeast of Sidon, provincial capital of southern Lebanon.
	   In retaliation for Thursday's attack, Israeli helicopters
strafed trails believed used by guerrillas with machine guns, and
other forces fired 15 mortars and about 40 shells, said Lebanese
security officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no word on casualties.
	   A statement by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah said its guerrillas
detonated the two bombs within 15 minutes of each other near an
Israeli patrol and then opened up with ``appropriate weapons'' as
reinforcements arrived at the scene.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the Israeli patrol
hit ``explosive devices'' as it traveled to military exercises. He
identified the dead as Lt. Amit Asulin, 21, and Sgt. Or Cohen, 19.
	   Three of the four wounded were in serious condition, he said.
	   Roadside bombs are the favorite weapon of guerrillas seeking to
dislodge 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied militiamen from
the occupied zone, which makes up 10 percent of Lebanese territory.
	   Thursday's fatalities raised to eight the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in southern Lebanon this year. The last Israeli
fatalities were May 28, when two soldiers were killed in an ambush.
	   In 1997, 39 Israeli soldiers were killed in guerrilla attacks, a
record annual figure since 1985 when Israel set up the occupied
zone to protect its northern towns from guerrilla attacks.

U.N. envoy sees progress in East Timor dispute 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Recent signs that Indonesia is softening
its stance on East Timor have nudged Lisbon and Jakarta closer to
agreement on the future of the disputed territory, a United Nations
envoy said Thursday.
	   ``We feel there's been an advance in the situation both in
Indonesia and East Timor. It represents an important development
and one that requires serious consideration,'' Jamsheed Marker, the
U.N. special envoy on East Timor, said here.
	   Marker spoke to reporters after meeting with Portuguese Foreign
Minister Jaime Gama in Lisbon to discuss new Jakarta proposals that
he refused to reveal publicly.
	   Indonesian troops invaded East Timor in 1975, a few months after
the departure of Portugal's colonial administration and annexed the
half-island territory the following year.
	   The move was not recognized by the U.N. which has been brokering
talks between Portugal and Indonesia on the future of East Timor
since 1983.
	   Since the resignation of President Suharto last month, his
successor B.J. Habibie has hinted that East Timor could be granted
some degree of autonomy as an Indonesian province.
	   He has also ordered the release of some East Timorese political
prisoners and pledged to scale down the Indonesian troop presence
in East Timor.
	   ``There are signs of openness ... Indonesia has changed its
vocabulary,'' Gama told reporters.
	   The minister nevertheless expressed some skepticism about
Jakarta's overtures, insisting on guarantees that the East Timorese
would be allowed to ``democratically express'' their opinion
through a referendum _ a move which so far has been ruled out by
Habibie.
	   Gama said Marker would propose to Indonesia a new round of talks
between Lisbon and Jakarta on East Timor.
	   Marker was also due to meet with East Timorese exiles in Lisbon.

Western mail-order firms challenge image of Japan's closed markets 
</HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan, alluring frontier of wide-open markets where
outsiders have the edge over local businesses.
	   Sound unlikely? Not if you're a direct marketer, says Cynthia
Miyashita, president of mail-order consultant Hemisphere Marketing
Inc.
	   From Australian wines to army survival kits to Japan's perennial
favorite _ silk lingerie _ foreign products are arriving en masse
at doorsteps across the country via catalog sales.
	   Despite Japan's recession, direct marketing has blossomed into a
dlrs 20 billion industry here, and foreign companies like outdoor
clothing maker Land's End and lingerie giant Victoria's Secret have
a 10 percent chunk of the market.
	   ``For those companies and individuals who say that Japan is a
closed market, I really can't think of an example of an easier
market entry than catalog sales,'' Miyashita told reporters
Thursday in Tokyo.
	   Japan's notoriously complex regulations, multilevel distribution
networks and even import duties are sidestepped by foreign
mail-order companies, Miyashita said.
	   A few cases in point:
	   _Japan's post offices are unequipped to impose taxes on the
hundreds of thousands of mail-order goods that flood the postal
system, making direct marketing products virtually duty-free. Local
competitors who import products in bulk have to pay hefty duties,
forcing up their prices.
	   _Many products, such as vitamins and cosmetics, are subject to
strict testing regulations in Japan, but those rules don't apply if
the products are sold through mail-order for personal consumption.
That gives direct mail customers in Japan access to a wide array of
otherwise unavailable products.
	   _American mailing costs are so cheap that it is more economical
to send a package from New York to Tokyo than from Tokyo to Osaka,
which reduces overhead costs for direct mail products.
	   And while Japanese companies aren't allowed to mail goods from
foreign post offices for sale at home, foreign companies face no
such restrictions.
	   ``Mail-order is the perfect solution for complaints about
Japan's complex distribution system,'' Miyashita said.
	   Analysts say Western mail-order companies have another edge over
their Japanese counterparts: expertise in an untapped niche.
	   Japan's direct mail companies have thrived in the tradition of
Sears, offering ordinary household goods in a staid, no-nonsense
presentation.
	   Western mail-order catalogs offer snob appeal _ at a bargain.
And they are skilled at the pitch, hawking dreams through
attractive location shots and layouts.
	   Consumers in Japan even offer to pay for foreign catalogs while,
at home, Western companies have trouble giving them away for free,
Miyashita said.
	   These advantages help in recessionary times. Consumer tastes,
honed during Japan's economic boom of the 1980s, remain luxurious
while pocketbooks become increasingly pinched.
	   ``There's one industry that I can think of that through good
times and bad times has done well in Japan _ and that's the mail
order industry,'' Miyashita said.
	   Between 1990 and 1996, direct marketing sales in Japan grew by
29 percent, Miyashita said, while Japanese department store sales
consistently declined.
	   Still, many Western direct-marketing companies have had to learn
to adapt their products to Japanese consumer tastes and to honor
their orders without fail in line with customer expectations.
	   Others have struggled simply because they haven't translated
their catalogs into Japanese.
	   And the yen's recent slide against the dollar is threatening to
erode the price advantage that American direct marketers enjoy,
even as the absence of middlemen keeps their overhead costs low.
	   ``A lot of it is psychology,'' says Miyashita. ``People say: Oh
now everything from America is too expensive.''

Queen opens new British Library panned by Charles 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II formally opened the new British
Library Thursday, praising the modern structure that her son Prince
Charles once derided as looking like ``an academy for secret
police.''
	   The 511-million-pound (dlrs 853 million) structure near St.
Pancras station was originally supposed to open a decade ago, and
the queen remarked that the opening had been in the royal pending
tray ``rather longer than most.''
	   ``This is the largest public building erected in Britain this
century, and it is entirely fitting that it should be a library,''
she said.
	   She and her husband, Prince Philip, toured the building and
looked at an original copy of Magna Carta, Jane Austen manuscripts
and Beatles memorabilia including the original handwritten lyrics
to ``I Wanna Hold Your Hand.''
	   ``I have now toured this remarkable building, and to my mind it
is truly worthy of our country's contribution to literature and
scholarship, to science and technology; a contribution which has
been, and still is, second to none,'' the queen said.
	   ``It is reassuring to find that, digital revolution
notwithstanding, the books collected by King George III are still
at the very heart of our national library, and given such a
prominent place in the glass tower behind me.''

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greek President Constantinos
Stephanopoulos arrived in Cyprus Thursday on the first visit by a
Greek head of state to this war-divided Mediterranean island.
	   The visit is seen as a show of Greek solidarity with Greek
Cypriots at a time of increased saber-rattling between Cyprus and
Turkey, which backs the island's breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   ``This is one of the most important moments in my life. This is
not a typical diplomatic visit but a visit of love, honor and
affection,'' Stephanopoulos said in an emotional arrival statement.
	   The Greek leader, whose red carpet welcome at Larnaca airport
was carried live on television and radio, was received by Greek
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and his entire Cabinet.
	   Thousands of Greek Cypriots, waving Greek and Cypriot flags,
cheered Stephanopoulos as his motorcade passed through Larnaca and
later the capital, Nicosia.
	   Stephanopoulos is a figurehead and his office is largely
ceremonial but his four-day trip has prompted Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel to visit the Turkish-Cypriot part of Cyprus in
mid-July. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said no exact date was set.

Kosovo Albanian leader cites ``ethnic cleansing'' in his province 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Ruehe comment re NATO intervention, NATO reax
By IAN MADER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Kosovo-Albanian political leader Ibrahim
Rugova reiterated demands for independence Thursday, despite urging
by NATO officials that he abandon the push and resume peace talks
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Rugova, after meeting in Bonn with Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel, said the ``climate'' was not right for talks.
	   He also intensified his appeal for NATO intervention in his
secessionist home province, saying that Serb-led forces were
driving out tens of thousands of his ethnic brethren.
	   He recalled the ``ethnic cleansing'' of the war in Bosnia in his
accounts of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian-majority province in the
Serb Republic that makes up most of Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova said that about 80,000 ethnic Albanians have been driven
from their homes by fighting between Serb forces and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. About 15,000 people have fled to
neighboring Albania. More than 300 people have been killed.
	   ``We see ethnic cleansing taking place already in Kosovo,'' said
Rugova, who was to meet later Thursday with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
He then returns to Kosovo for talks Thursday or Friday with U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, who helped broker the Bosnian peace
accord.
	   Kinkel said he made clear to Rugova that Germany and most
Western powers oppose independence for Kosovo but want to see its
autonomy restored. Milosevic stripped Kosovo of its broad autonomy
in 1989 and introduced virtual martial law.
	   He urged Western powers to increase pressure on Milosevic to
withdraw forces from Kosovo and to make clear that NATO is
considering military intervention. Kinkel also called on militant
Albanians to follow the pacifist Rugova in renouncing violence.
	   The foreign minister said NATO should try to secure Russia's
support for intervention in Kosovo, as it did for its U.N.-mandated
intervention in Bosnia. So far, Russia has opposed Western military
pressure on Yugoslavia, its longtime ally.
	   ``Why can't NATO and Russia go together, as they did in
Bosnia?'' Kinkel asked. ``We don't want to attack anyone. We just
want to restore order on the ground.''
	   Defense Minister Volker Ruehe told ARD television Thursday that
NATO would rely on air power to end the violence and expulsions in
Kosovo. Ground troops would be used only to enforce a peace
agreement, as was done in Bosnia, he said.
	   NATO has said it is keeping all options open, including sending
ground troops for military action. But a NATO official in Brussels,
speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested Thursday that ground
troops would be a last, and unlikely, resort.
	   ``Sending ground troops _ whether for military action or even
peacekeeping operations _ is an option that sits on the highest
rung of the ladder,'' the official said.

Arab League condemns Israel's plans to extend Jerusalem authority 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Thursday condemned
Israel's decision to extend some Jerusalem municipal services to
West Bank settlements, calling it an attempt to ``eliminate the
Arab identity of east Jerusalem.''
	   The 22-member league also warned in a statement that the
implementation of the plans will ``destroy the (Middle East) peace
process and put the entire area on the brink.'
	   The meeting was called by the Palestinians to discuss an Israeli
blueprint for Jerusalem that would extend some services to Jewish
West Bank settlements _ a step the Palestinians fear will lead to
the annexation of West Bank land, and will choke off Arab parts of
Jerusalem from other Palestinian areas.
	   ``This is a very dangerous decision and will have grave
consequences,'' the statement said.
	   The league said it will ask the U.N. Security Council to discuss
the Israeli move, describing it as a violation of U.N. resolutions
and international law.
	   The Israeli Cabinet said the decision, announced this month, is
aimed at strengthening ties between Jewish settlements and
Jerusalem. It has infuriated Palestinians who want to set up the
capital of their would-be state in east Jerusalem, which Israel
occupied in the 1967 Middle East War.

Iraqi newspapers denounce U.N. decision to prolong sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Iraqi ambassador's comments.
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's ruling party newspaper insisted
Thursday that Baghdad has no more illegal weapons to disclose, and
the country's U.N. ambassador warned of a new crisis if the
Security Council does not move to end sanctions soon.
	   ``Iraq cannot provide what it does not have,'' al-Thawra said
after the council decided Wednesday to maintain sanctions for
another three months. The newspaper is published by the ruling
Baath Party.
	   The council decision was taken after the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, said tests by a U.S. Army laboratory
left ``no doubt'' that Iraq had put deadly VX nerve gas in missile
warheads, despite Baghdad's denials.
	   Butler said he would send the materials to labs in Switzerland
and France to verify the American finding.
	   Iraq must destroy such weapons and disclose all details of
illegal arms programs to U.N. inspectors before the council will
lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   In recent months, Iraq had convinced some council members _
notably Russia, France and China _ that it had made significant
progress in disclosing weapons information.
	   But the report by the U.S. Army laboratory in Aberdeen, Md.,
raised doubt about Iraq's claims and could set efforts to complete
the inspection program soon unless the Iraqis release information
they claim they do not have.
	   Following the council decision, Iraq's U.N. ambassador warned of
a new showdown with the United Nations unless the Security Council
accepts Baghdad's claims and brings the sanctions to an end.
	   ``Iraq was trying hard to clear all the (weapons) files before
the end of the year, and if it doesn't look at any point the
sanctions will be lifted, Iraq will be reconsidering its policy,''
Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said Wednesday night on the U.S. news
program ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.''
	   Hamdoon refused to predict when the crisis would emerge but
added ``that if it looks like the sanctions are not going to be
lifted this year, then Iraq may well consider a different policy.''
	   Other Iraqi state-controlled newspapers echoed that warning
Thursday. They republished a statement issued by Iraqi leaders on
May 1, warning the Security Council of unspecified ``grave
consequences'' if the embargo is not lifted.
	   Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, a presidential adviser and father of
Iraq's chemical warfare program, said he was surprised by what
Butler reported.
	   ``We know very well VX was never weaponized ... how did the VX
appear there (on missile warheads), we have no idea,'' he told
reporters.
	   Last year, the United States sent aircraft carriers, bombers and
thousands of troops to reinforce demands that Iraq open all sites
to U.N. inspectors.
	   The crisis was defused when Secretary-General Kofi Annan signed

Fighters beat Hawks 6-3 on Brooks' grand slam 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Jerry Brooks hit a grand slam home run in the first
inning and the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters
went on to beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 6-3 at Tokyo Dome Thursday.
	   Brooks, formerly with the Florida Marlins, has 16 homers.
	   The Fighters have a three-game lead over the Kintetsu Buffaloes,
who were idle Thursday.
	   No other Pacific League games were scheduled Thursday.
	   In the Central League, Takashi Saitoh pitched a three-hitter
over six innings and Toshio Haru singled home the first run in the
third inning as the front-running Yokohama BayStars beat the Yakult
Swallows 3-1 at Yokohama. Saitoh is 4-2.
	   The BayStars, who extended their winning streak to seven, are
one game ahead of the Yomiuri Giants, who beat the Hiroshima Toyo
Carp 4-2 at Hiroshima.
	   Hideki Matsui of the Giants hit a two-run home run in the first
inning. He has 16 homers and leads the league.
	   The Carp suffered their eighth straight defeat.
	   At Nagoya Dome, the Chunichi Dragons blanked the Hanshin Tigers
1-0 on Takeshi Nakamura's one-run double in the seventh.
	   That came after Kazuyoshi Tatsunami's single _ only the Dragons'
second hit of the game against Darrel May.
	   May, formerly with the Anaheim Angels, gave up three hits over
seven innings and took the loss. He is 1-2.

Iraqi newspapers denounce U.N. decision to prolong sanctions comments. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with Iraqi ambassador's
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's ruling party newspaper insisted
Thursday that Baghdad has no more illegal weapons to disclose, and
the country's U.N. ambassador warned of a new crisis if the
Security Council does not move to end sanctions soon.
	   ``Iraq cannot provide what it does not have,'' al-Thawra said
after the council decided Wednesday to maintain sanctions for
another three months. The newspaper is published by the ruling
Baath Party.
	   The council decision was taken after the chief U.N. weapons
inspector, Richard Butler, said tests by a U.S. Army laboratory
left ``no doubt'' that Iraq had put deadly VX nerve gas in missile
warheads, despite Baghdad's denials.
	   Butler said he would send the materials to labs in Switzerland
and France to verify the American finding.
	   Iraq must destroy such weapons and disclose all details of
illegal arms programs to U.N. inspectors before the council will
lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after President
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
	   In recent months, Iraq had convinced some council members _
notably Russia, France and China _ that it had made significant
progress in disclosing weapons information.
	   But the report by the U.S. Army laboratory in Aberdeen,
Maryland, raised doubt about Iraq's claims and could set efforts to
complete the inspection program soon unless the Iraqis release
information they claim they do not have.
	   Following the council decision, Iraq's U.N. ambassador warned of
a new showdown with the United Nations unless the Security Council
accepts Baghdad's claims and brings the sanctions to an end.
	   ``Iraq was trying hard to clear all the (weapons) files before
the end of the year, and if it doesn't look at any point the
sanctions will be lifted, Iraq will be reconsidering its policy,''
Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said Wednesday night on the U.S. news
program ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.''
	   Hamdoon refused to predict when the crisis would emerge but
added ``that if it looks like the sanctions are not going to be
lifted this year, then Iraq may well consider a different policy.''
	   Other Iraqi state-controlled newspapers echoed that warning
Thursday. They republished a statement issued by Iraqi leaders on
May 1, warning the Security Council of unspecified ``grave
consequences'' if the embargo is not lifted.
	   Lt. Gen. Amer al-Saadi, a presidential adviser and father of
Iraq's chemical warfare program, said he was surprised by what
Butler reported.
	   ``We know very well VX was never weaponized ... how did the VX
appear there (on missile warheads), we have no idea,'' he told
reporters.
	   Last year, the United States sent aircraft carriers, bombers and
thousands of troops to reinforce demands that Iraq open all sites
to U.N. inspectors.
	   The crisis was defused when Secretary-General Kofi Annan signed
an agreement in February to open all sites, including Saddam's
palaces.

U.S. envoy meets with Milosevic in Kosovo shuttle talks Serbian government minister protesting Holbrooke's meeting with KLA; TRIMS Wednesday material 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with talks over, Holbrooke going to Pristina Friday,
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Pressing hard for a cease-fire and
Serb pullback in Kosovo, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke met with
President Slobodan Milosevic again Thursday in a new round of
shuttle diplomacy.
	   Trying to head off NATO intervention in Kosovo, Holbrooke sat
down with Milosevic in the presidential palace for several hours
for the second time in three days. Neither side commented
immediately on what was said.
	   He also was expected to meet with a Russian envoy before heading
back to Kosovo on Friday with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
in the provincial capital, Pristina.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting this year between
Serb-led security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which
enjoys growing popularity in the predominantly Albanian province of
Serbia.
	   During a trip to Germany, Rugova reiterated demands for
independence despite having been urged by NATO officials that he
abandon the push and resume peace talks with Milosevic.
	   After meeting in Bonn with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Rugova
said the ``climate'' was not right for talks.
	   He also intensified his appeal for NATO intervention in his
secessionist home province, saying the Serbs had sent about 80,000
ethnic Albanians fleeing from their homes.
	   Kinkel said NATO should try to secure Russian support for
intervention in Kosovo. Russia has been a longtime ally of the
Serbs.
	   ``We don't want to attack anyone,'' he said. ``We just want to
restore order on the ground.''
	   Rugova was meeting later with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Holbrooke's meeting and posing for photographs with Albanian
fighters during an inspection tour of Kosovo on Wednesday was
assailed by Serbian government officials.
	   A well-known hardliner, Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj, said it
proves the Americans are ``training and arming the Albanian
terrorists, financially helping them, plotting and directing their
terrorist actions,'' the official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   He called for a halt to all talks about Kosovo with the United
States.
	   Holbrooke had dismissed any political significance to his talks
with two local Kosovo Liberation Army leaders in Junik, calling
them only unofficial meetings with armed men.
	   In reports of the latest fighting, the Serbs' Media Center said
Thursday that armed Albanians killed a Serb schoolteacher in an
attack late Wednesday on Kijevo village west of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said Serb-led government forces opened
grenade fire Thursday in a portion of territory in southwestern
Kosovo that Holbrooke visited the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, in another sign of deterioration, armed Serb and
Albanian villagers, apparently not part of the KLA or the police,
are increasingly firing at each other in parts of Kosovo that until
recently were not engulfed in violence.
	   Northwest of Pristina, local Serbs and Albanians are keeping
guard day and night around their villages and occasionally
exchanging fire. Two Albanians were reported wounded late Wednesday
in the village of Pantina, and women and children were evacuated.

Tobacco executive jailed for taking millions in bribes 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A former tobacco executive convicted of taking
millions of dollars in bribes was sentenced Thursday to three
years, eight months in prison, Hong Kong's top graft-fighting body
said.
	   A High Court judge also fined Jerry Lui Kin-hong 500,000 Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 64,100), and ordered him to pay 11 million
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.4 million) in prosecution costs and
return 10 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.28 million) to his
former employers, a statement from the Independent Commission
Against Corruption said.
	   Lui, 44, was found guilty earlier this month of accepting 33
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.2 million) in cash and
unsecured loans between June 1988 and December 1993 when he was an
executive at British-American Tobacco Co. (HK) Ltd. and its
subsidiary, Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp.
	   He was accused of conspiring with executives of several local
companies to supply them with cigarettes from British-American
Tobacco free of government-imposed taxes.
	   Lui was arrested in Boston in December 1995, but was extradited
to Hong Kong only last May.
	   He created a stir in Hong Kong when a Boston judge accepted his
argument that by the time he went on trial, the extradition treaty
between the United States and Britain would have lapsed.
	   Hong Kong was still a British colony at the time of Lui's
arrest, awaiting its switch to Chinese sovereignty last July 1.
	   A U.S. federal appeals court overturned the ruling last March,
and Lui was flown to Hong Kong in May.

She likes a man in uniform _ too much 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish woman likes men in uniform _
so much that she patted a policeman's fanny and got fined 300
kroner (dlrs 43).
	   Ulla Isendam said she saw officer Henrik Basse one day and
couldn't resist ``his cute little bum,'' the newspaper Berlingske
Tidende reported Thursday.
	   Basse was affronted and took the 28-year-old woman to the local
police station in Hilleroed, 35 kilometers (22 miles) north of
Copenhagen, and charged her with injury to his integrity and
indecent behavior.
	   Basse sued her for 5,000 kroner, basing the amount on awards
given to three female police officers who had been similarly
handled. But the Hilleroed town court imposed a lower fine.
	   The fine may have depleted Isendam's wallet, but hasn't stilled
her blood.
	   ``I still get turned on by men in uniforms so I guess I can't
resist tapping more behinds in the future,'' the newspaper Ekstra
Bladet quoted her as saying.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Thursday condemned
Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem municipal services to West
Bank settlements, calling it an attempt to ``eliminate the Arab
identity of east Jerusalem.''
	   The 22-member league also warned in a statement that the
implementation of the plans will ``destroy the (Middle East) peace
process and put the entire area on the brink.''
	   The meeting was called by the Palestinians to discuss the
Israeli blueprint for Jerusalem that would extend some municipal
services to Jewish West Bank settlements _ a step the Palestinians
fear will lead to the annexation of West Bank land, and will choke
off Arab parts of Jerusalem from other Palestinian areas.

Independent gives Labor government, denies One Nation a role Hanson policies 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with quote from premier-elect, background on
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Ending the immediate chances of new
right-wing party One Nation having a direct role in an Australian
government, an independent legislator handed power in Queensland
state to the Labor Party Thursday by pledging his support.
	   Labor leader Peter Beattie will be sworn in as Queensland
premier on Friday after Peter Wellington announced he would give
the party his crucial vote on bills relating to money and
confidence.
	   In statewide elections on June 13, Labor fell just one short of
winning a majority of seats in the 89-seat Queensland parliament.
	   One Nation sent shockwaves through Australian politics by
capturing 23 percent of the total vote in the elections, the
party's first electoral test since its creation little more than
one year ago.
	   Led by independent federal legislator Pauline Hanson, One Nation
severely eroded support for the conservative coalition that
previously held power in Queensland and which Prime Minister John
Howard heads nationally.
	   One Nation scores in mid-double figures in national opinion
polls, and the government fears a repeat of the Queensland vote at
federal elections expected anytime after July.
	   Hanson claims Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by
Asians,'' opposes foreign control of local companies, opposes
special welfare payments to Aborigines and advocates protectionist
economics.
	   Declaring that his government will be more accountable and
inclusive, Beattie said Thursday that One Nation's success had led
to damaging reports overseas about Queensland.
	   ``My government will set about repairing the damage as quickly
as possible,'' he told reporters.
	   Howard said One Nation voters were partly to blame for Labor
winning power in Queensland because they did not vote for the
coalition.
	   ``Those who voted One Nation in protest at the coalition parties
will no doubt contemplate the irony of having helped elect a Labor
government,'' he told the national Parliament.
	   One Nation spokesman David Oldfield said Hanson would remind
Beattie he does not have the support of a majority of voters.
	   ``She hopes that he will realize that he does not have a
mandate,'' Oldfield said.
	   Outgoing Premier Rob Borbidge had been trying to stitch together
a government relying on the support of the 11 One Nation
legislators, Wellington and another independent, Liz Cunningham.
	   Beattie said he would not deal with One Nation, but would seek
the support of either or both independents.
	   Announcing his decision, Wellington said: ``I am of the view
that the Labor party is best able to provide stable government.''
	   Borbidge officially resigned his commission soon after.

Modest growth in the insurance industry, says report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The worldwide insurance market saw
modest growth in 1996, the most recent year for which figures are
available, according to a report released Thursday.
	   Total premium volume _ the amount paid by policyholders for
insurance protection _ was dlrs 2.1 trillion, representing a growth
rate of just 1 percent in real terms and a drop from the 1995
figure of 3.7 percent, said the study by the Swiss Reinsurance
Company's economic research department.
	   Growth rates dipped sharply compared with 1995 in both the
non-life and life insurance businesses, with increases of 0.5
percent and 1.3 percent respectively, falling back to the same
levels as at the beginning of the decade.
	   The biggest insurance markets were the United States, with a 31
percent world market share (dlrs 653 billion), and Japan with 24.7
percent (dlrs 520 billion).
	   Growth rates in most regions including North America, Western
Europe and South and East Asia were below long-term averages, the
report said.
	   Premiums stagnated in Eastern Europe and declined in Japan and
Latin America. Life insurers in Japan saw premium volumes fall by
more than 7 percent, said the study.
	   It said Japanese life insurers were badly hit by the previous
years' slump in the real estate and stock markets, which led to
massive write-offs on capital assets.
	   In North America, the report said increased capacity in the
market led to more competition for market share, causing premium
volumes to fall.
	   Steady liberalization in Europe allowing new providers into the
market has also led to tougher competition.
	   The Swiss spent most on insurance in 1996, shelling out dlrs
4,663 per inhabitant _ roughly twice as much as North America.

Clinton defends close U.S.-China ties as important for world's future TRIMS for length AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS with 1 graf to CORRECT style on Clinton, time element;
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ Welcomed with ancient pageantry, U.S.
President Bill Clinton began his journey through China with a
declaration Thursday that commitment to human dignity and freedom
is as ``vital to the strength and success'' of this nation as it is
in America.
	   Clinton came to pursue at the summit, at village roundtables,
with communists and with stockbrokers the East-West relationship he
calls crucial to peace and stability in the 21st century.
	   He had said he would be striving for the advancement of
political and human rights, an issue rankling a Congress divided
over his policy of cordial engagement and investigating his prior
deals with Beijing. A reminder of that political stress _ six
members of Congress, all Democrats, traveled with him, on an
invitation the administration said Republicans spurned.
	   Thus, the extravagant ceremonial welcome at the South Gate of
the Old City of Xi'an opened a presidential mission disputed at
home. Even the sendoff was marred by formal diplomatic protest
after China revoked visas to bar three reporters for Radio Free
Asia, a U.S. government broadcaster nettlesome to Beijing.
	   Clinton spoke first of U.S.-China accord, not discord. ``We
Americans admire your accomplishments, your economy, your hard work
and vision, your efforts against hunger and poverty, your work with
us on peace and stability in Korea and South Asia,'' Clinton said.
	   Then the polite lecture:
	   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' he told a throng in the old city. ``In this global
information age, where both economic growth and equal opportunity
are based on ideas, a commitment to providing all human beings the
opportunity to develop their full potential is vital to the
strength and success of the new China as well.''
	   As for the critics, Clinton said: ``There may be those here and
back in America who wonder whether closer ties and deeper
friendship between China and America are good.''
	   ``Clearly, the answer is yes,'' he said. ``We have a powerful
ability to help each other grow.''
	   Clinton delighted the crowd by opening his speech with a few
words of Chinese: ``Ni, hao ma?'' _ which means ``Hello, how are
you?'' He closed by saying ``Thank you'' in Chinese.
	   Air Force One landed in the murky dusk of a city shrouded by
chronic smog. At the formal welcoming rites, giant red-globe
lanterns reflected in the floodlights along the 200-yard, broad red
carpet that was Clinton's path to his greeting.
	   It was a rainbow scene of gowns, costumes, elaborate headdresses
of dynasties long past, of customed as warriors parading to bow to
the president, of dancers waving banners and scarlet globes on
lofty staffs, all amid the music of gongs, flutes and drums.
	   The pageant was styled an ``emperor's welcome,'' after rituals
dating from the 7th century rulers of imperial China. Xi'an Mayor
Feng Xichu presented Clinton the ceremonial gold key to the city.
	   But there was no easing the controversy, as a congressional
committee in Washington heard testimony on alleged leaks of U.S.
missile technology to China, while a Beijing official defended the
satellite deals involved.
	   The foreign ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said today that
cooperation on satellite launches ``benefits both sides. Those who
are in the mainstream of bilateral relations should have a correct
view.''
	   Tang dismissed U.S. investigations as ``a wave of noise in the
United States that is intended to obstruct the development of
bilateral relations with the United States. We believe it by no
means represents the attitude of most American people.''
	   Clinton views his nine-day mission to China, the first by an
American president since George Bush's in February 1989, as the
right way to increase America's impact on human rights, nuclear
weapons spread and efforts to stabilize shaken Asian economies.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' Clinton said
at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, where his plane stopped to
refuel.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' he told about 4,000 people
who turned out to see him on his way.
	   But even as Clinton flew to China, Chinese police arrested two
dissidents in a display of Beijing's hard line against
pro-democracy activists.
	   The gritty industrial city surrounding Xi'an was primped,
painted and flag-decked for Clinton's arrival.
	   On Friday, Clinton goes to the village of Xia He for what is
billed as a roundtable discussion with ordinary Chinese citizens
about their lives in a changing society. He'll speak in the village
square. Then Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, are
tourists for an afternoon, visiting the unearthed terra cotta
warriors, pottery soldiers fashioned to guard an emperor in the
afterlife.
	   Then to Beijing on Saturday, opening with the event that has
stirred the greatest controversy at home: a formal welcoming in
Tiananmen Square, scene of the democracy demonstrations bloodily
repressed by Chinese troops in June 1989.
	   Clinton defends his decision to go to that symbolic site as
protocol, not substance, and said he will speak America's piece for
human rights and freedom. But not there; no speeches at Tiananmen.

Spain mourns World Cup exit 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Bitter victory or epic tragedy, Thursday's
headlines rammed home the futility of Spain's 6-1 trouncing of
Bulgaria that marked its goodbye to the 1998 World Cup the night
before.
	   And accompanying the words, the photos chosen displayed images
of desolation and pain at Spain's elimination from the competition
in the first round _ its worst World Cup performance since 1978 in
Argentina.
	   On the inside pages Coach Javier Clemente took much of the blame
for the national shame sealed by Spain's 3-2 defeat by Nigeria it
is first game and goalless draw against Paraguay in its second.
	   Throughout the competition Clemente has been criticized by the
Spanish press for arrogance, lack of refinement and being
confrontational with journalists.
	   ``Nobody is more responsible for the failure than Clemente _
that foul-spoken coach submerged in a destructive process that
ended up contaminating the players,'' leading daily El Pais said.
	   But while the pugnacious coach's future at the head of the squad
was put in doubt, direct calls for his dismissal were notably
absent.
	   Madrid-based sports daily Marca and national newspaper El Mundo
announced a ``national debate'' on Clemente's position.
Barcelona-based sports paper El Mundo Deportivo wrote ``The
question on the street is should Clemente go or not.''
	   Despite the criticism, Clemente's impressive track record since
taking over the national squad in 1992 was not rubbished and
Spain's ignominious exit from the World Cup was also treated with a
sense of fatalism.
	   Despite being one of the globes great soccer nations, the last
time Spain reached the World Cup semifinals was in 1950.

In about turn, Britain pledges to ratify mine treaty by Diana anniversary With Britain-Diana-Memories 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a swift about turn, Britain's Labor Party
government said Thursday it will schedule extra parliamentary
sittings, if necessary, to ratify an international treaty on
banning land mines before the Aug. 31 first anniversary of the
death of Princess Diana.
	   ``It may mean sitting on a non-sitting day,'' Prime Minister
Tony Blair's official spokesman told reporters, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   On Tuesday, International Development Secretary Clare Short said
there was no parliamentary time to ratify the treaty, signed in
Ottawa in December by 100 nations, including Britain, but not the
United States.
	   However, with the Diana-anniversary buildup gaining momentum _
including TV documentaries and her brother, Earl Spencer, opening
to the public the family estate where she is buried, Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Cabinet changed its mind at a meeting Thursday.
	   Several lawmakers have also been attracting publicity by urging
ratification by the anniversary. Banning land mines was a caused
espoused by Diana, and she visited victims in Angola and Bosnia.
	   Blair's spokesman said apart from the technical problem of time,
legal drafters also faced a problem getting the ratification
wording right so British troops on exercise with a non-signatory
country did not break the law. An example would be British troops
escorting a convoy carrying land mines from a non-signatory
country.
	   Parliament, which sits Monday through Thursday, usually rises
for a recess of about 10 weeks late July or early August,.
Thursday's Cabinet decision means the Ottawa Treaty must be
ratified before the parliamentary recess.

World Cup: Netherlands leads Mexico 2-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ The Netherlands moved on the verge
of clinching first place in World Cup Group E after taking a 2-0
halftime lead over Mexico on Thursday.
	   Phillip Cocu netted exactly four minutes into the game, and
Ronald de Boer beat three defenders to score in the 19th on a cool,
rainy day at Stade Geoffroy Guichard.
	   A loss would put the Mexicans' second-round hopes in serious
jeopardy. They would need South Korea to beat or tie Belgium to
keep the Belgians from taking second place in the group. Belgium
led South Korea 1-0 at halftime in a match being played at the same
time.
	   Cocu opened the scoring when he outraced the defense to chase
down Dennis Bergkamp's long pass to drive a left-footed shot past
goalkeeper Jorge Campos. Cocu celebrated with a head-first dive on
the soaked turf.
	   De Boer followed with one of the best individual efforts of the
tournament. He shook off three challenges before sending the ball
between the legs of defender Joel Sanchez and off the left post,
catching Campos moving in the wrong direction.
	   Campos made a nice save on Bergkamp in the 30th minute, but he
didn't have a chance against Marc Overmars' chip shot that drifted
tantalizingly wide of the post in the 40th.
	   Mexico's play was ragged, with possession surrendered easily and
often in midfield. Its best scoring chance came in the 11th minute,
when Ramon Ramirez' 12-meter drive was knocked away by goalkeeper
Edwin van der Sar's right hand. Cuauhtemoc Blanco's follow-up went
straight to the keeper.

Italy's Communists say Prodi's coalition will keep governing possible use of Italian bases by in case of Kosovo intervention, EDITS to trim 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with leftist leader saying issues to discuss include
By VANIA GRANDI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Two days after refusing to back the government in
voting for NATO's eastward expansion, Premier Romano Prodi's
Communist allies indicated Thursday they were committed to keeping
the government in place.
	   ``It is necessary and possible to maintain, or rather
strengthen, the agreement between our democratic forces,'' said
Armando Cossuta, the No. 2 of the Communist Refoundation party.
``Otherwise, it would be a triumph for the opposition.''
	   The Communists, who usually give Prodi the majority he needs in
the Chamber of Deputies, on Tuesday voted against NATO's eastward
enlargement, forcing the premier to rely on votes from an
opposition centrist party.
	   The split prompted Prodi's center-left partners to schedule a
meeting next week to see if they can develop a more united front.
On Wednesday, Prodi said he saw no other alternative to his
coalition partners, and that either the consultations would result
in a renewed show of support from the Communists or the end of the
coalition.
	   Massimo D'Alema, leader of the coalition's largest party, the
Democratic Party of the Left, said the issues to be discussed
include what the Communists' position would be if the United Nation
asked to use Italian bases in any intervention involving Kosovo.
	   Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti has insisted that despite the
split on NATO his group would support Prodi in any confidence vote,
making any near prospect for a government collapse unlikely.
	   Prodi has rejected opposition requests that he resign for
failing to have full backing from the government's regular
supporters.
	   Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro urged the governing
coalition to overcome their differences so it can ``maintain a
commitment'' made to the people who elected the government parties
two years ago.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Reluctant to kill one of two hippos that
strayed into a Nairobi suburb, the Kenya Wildlife Service hopes the
animal will move away as the swollen Ruaka River subsides, a
spokesman said Thursday.
	   On Sunday, rangers shot one of the two hippos after it collided
with a car. The animal suffered a broken leg and the car was badly
damaged.
	   The Wildlife Service, responsible for protecting wildlife in
this East African nation, shoots wild animals only if they are
considered a danger or are sick or wounded.
	   Spokesman John Mlamba said KWS rangers feared that if darts are
used to tranquilize the hippo it might drown before it could be
hauled from the water.
	   The hippos are believed to have made their way into Nairobi from
the flooded Athi river, 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of the city.
	   -----
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ An outspoken opposition
legislator has been banned from the parliamentary session after
failing to substantiate claims the government was plotting to
assassinate him.
	   Augustine Lyatonga Mrema, chairman of the National Convention
for Construction and Reform, had said the government planned to
kill him in the same way a former intelligence chief died in 1996.
	   An inquest established a policeman mistook the intelligence
chief for a car thief when he shot him to death in northern
Tanzania at night.
	   Mrema had also charged the government was planning
assassinations in the opposition Civic United Party which has
refused to recognize Zanzibar's President Salmin Armour, saying
October 1995 elections were rigged.
	   Mrema pleaded not to be suspended, saying he had served the
country well, but fellow legislators overwhelmingly voted to throw
him out.
	   The current session ends before Christmas.
	   Mrema was a deputy prime minister before he formed his own
party. He is also facing criminal charges for accusing President
Benjamin Mkapa's government of corruption.
	   -----
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Tanzania has lost dlrs 827,000 in
business with Burundi since regional leaders imposed sanctions on
the tiny central Africa nation in July 1996, the government-owned
Daily News newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Seven countries, including Tanzania, cut road, lake and air
links with Burundi after retired army major, Pierre Buyoya, ousted
a civilian government.
	   About 70 percent of Burundi's imports and exports passed through
Tanzania's Indian Ocean port of Dar es Salaam.
	   After talks involving all parties to the Burundi conflict in the
northern Tanzania town of Arusha last week, Buyoya's government
said sanctions should be lifted because it had met all the demands
made by regional leaders.
	   ------
	   BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ Lawmakers criticized police and prison
authorities for lax duties after two notorious criminals escaped
from a convoy taking them from court.
	   Clive Macholowe and Sanudi Majidi were facing trial for
allegedly murdering a policeman.
	   ``What stopped the warders from disabling the escapees by
shooting as is provided by law?'' said Gwanda Chakuamba, head of
the opposition Malawi Congress Party and a former political
detainee.
	   Chakuamba, speaking Wednesday, said the two fugitives evidently
walked with family members through the main airport unchallenged
and were now believed to be in Canada.
	   In a recent report, the Inspectorate of Prisons said 150
prisoners escaped from custody in the past 18 months.
	   The son of Information Minister Sam Mpasu, who was among the
suspects to be tried with Macholowe and Majidi, fled the country
before the trial started.
	   ------
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The trial of former President Canaan
Banana on 11 charges of sexually molesting men went into an
indefinite recess to consider a verdict after 17 days of testimony.
	   Banana, 62, a Methodist minister and theology professor, has
pleaded innocent to the charges. He was remanded out of custody on
20,000 Zimbabwe dollars (dlrs 1,100) bail.
	   Chris Andersen, Banana's lawyer, denied anything improper took
place between Banana and State House aides from 1980 to 1987 while
he served as non-executive president.
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe and carry a penalty of
imprisonment or a fine.
	   President Robert Mugabe has waged an outspoken campaign against
gay rights, describing same sex partners are ``lower than pigs and
dogs.''
	   Accusations against Banana surfaced after a former State House
aide shot a policeman who taunted him as ``Banana's wife.'' Jefta
Dube alleged Banana forced him into a three-year homosexual
relationship.
	   ------
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ An independent candidate for mayor of
Maputo, Phillipe Gagnaux, accused the Electoral Administration
Technical Secretariat of failing to carry out voter education ahead
of local elections scheduled June 30.
	   Gagnaux, main challenger to incumbent Mayor Artur Canana, said
during campaigning he found people knew little about the polls and
confused them with national parliamentary voting, the Mozambique
News Agency, AIM, reported.
	   Gagnaux claimed election officials were inefficient or did their
duties in a hurry and also failed to stop candidates tearing down
posters and fliers of their rivals.
	   Gagnaux said he offered a program for the Mozambican capital
that would promote investment, respond to regional integration
challenges and create ``a safe and tranquil city.''
	   ------
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Alcohol abuse accounted for 78
percent of admissions to drug treatment centers in three South
African cities, the Medical Research Council said Thursday.
	   In a report on International Day Against Drug Abuse, the council
said more than half deaths investigated at Salt River mortuary in
Cape Town showed blood alcohol levels well over the legal limit for
driving a car.
	   Typical figures were tallied in the cities of Cape Town, Durban
and Port Elizabeth.
	   The council said cannabis was widely used in South Africa and
crack cocaine appeared to be common among by sex workers. Heroin
abuse was generally low, accounting for less than two percent of
treatment admissions in the three cities.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish woman likes men in uniform _
so much that she patted a policeman's behind and got fined 300
kroner (dlrs 43).
	   Ulla Isendam said she saw officer Henrik Basse one day and
couldn't resist ``his cute little bum,'' the newspaper Berlingske
Tidende reported Thursday.
	   Basse was affronted and took the 28-year-old woman to the local
police station in Hilleroed, 35 kilometers (22 miles) north of
Copenhagen, and charged her with injury to his integrity and
indecent behavior.
	   Basse sued her for 5,000 kroner, basing the amount on awards
given to three female police officers who had been similarly
handled. But the Hilleroed town court imposed a lower fine.
	   The fine may have depleted Isendam's wallet, but hasn't stilled
her blood.
	   ``I still get turned on by men in uniforms so I guess I can't
resist tapping more behinds in the future,'' the newspaper Ekstra
Bladet quoted her as saying.

U.N. study finds pro-government bias in Cambodian electronic media 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Cambodia-Election
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A study of Cambodian television news
broadcasts in May supports opposition views that they are heavily
biased in favor of the government, a U.N. official said Thursday.
	   All television stations in Cambodia are either directly
controlled by the government of strongman Hun Sen, or under the
influence of his Cambodian People's Party.
	   ``For the most part, opposition politicians do not exist on
Cambodian television and radio,'' said a report by Thomas
Hammarberg, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general
for human rights in Cambodia.
	   He released the 14-page report on Thursday, the first official
day of campaigning for the July 26 election.
	   Hammarberg said that during an electoral campaign, it is
especially important that freedom of expression be respected, but
that only the government and its allies have had access to the
all-important electronic media.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party is the apparent front-runner
for the upcoming election, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his
FUNCINPEC party are the main challengers.
	   Ranariddh and other opposition figures have complained that they
are not being allowed equal access to the media.
	   After Hun Sen deposed his co-premier, Ranariddh, in a coup last
July, radio and television stations sympathetic to Ranariddh were
taken over by Hun Sen and his party.
	   On the main newscasts of state or quasi-state television
stations in May this year, Hun Sen appeared on 170 occasions and
his ally Ung Huot 68 times, according to monitoring done by the
U.N. Center for Human Rights.
	   Opposition figures Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy each appeared only
five times, Hammarberg's report said.
	   On a party basis, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party appeared
448 times, Ung Huot's Reastr Niyum 91 times, Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party nine times and the Sam Rainsy Party five times.
	   The report noted that when Ranariddh returned from exile on
March 30 this year, there was no coverage on Cambodian television
stations. News directors later stated that his return was not
newsworthy. It was, however, the top news story on the
international news network CNN that day.
	   On Wednesday, editors of seven Cambodia newspapers declared they
would risk their own safety and ignore an official media guideline
for the upcoming election because it violated their
``constitutional freedom of the press.''
	   Their open letter asked for the support of all international
organizations ``to help us keep our freedom and our ability to
inform readers according to our ability as journalists.''
	   It protested a guideline set by the National Election Commission
banning all commercial media groups from publishing any materials
that could be construed to be of service to any political entities.

Afghanistan's future grim, unless outside interference ends: Secretary-General With Afghanistan-Rockets 
</HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
predicted a grim future for war-shattered Afghanistan Thursday
unless its neighbors stop supporting the war effort with military
aid and Afghan warriors put down their weapons and talk.
	   In his report, released to The Associated Press in Islamabad,
Annan called the protracted civil war in Afghanistan a ``tragedy''
and renewed fighting ``alarming''.
	   Three rockets slammed into the combined military and civilian
airport in the Afghan capital of Kabul earlier Thursday just as
passengers were being loaded on to a U.N. plane parked on the
tarmac.
	   Annan said his report was in response to the U.N. Security
Council's request for ``regular information on developments in
Afghanistan.''
	   In the three months that the report covers:
	   _ Peace talks between the warring factions that opened in
neighboring Pakistan in April broke down after one week;
	   _ Road blockades continue to hamper U.N. efforts to get
humanitarian aid to hungry people in opposition-held areas,
particularly in central Afghanistan's Bamyan region.
	   _ The United Nations withdrew its international staff from
southern Kandahar to protest attacks on its staff by the Taliban
governor of the area.
	   _ Negotiations between the United Nations and the Taliban to
provide access to education and health care for girls and women has
run into relentless snags, the latest being this month's decision
by the Taliban to close more than 100 home schools, many of them
educating girls.
	   _Fresh fighting between the Taliban and a northern-based
anti-Taliban alliance made up of Afghanistan's minority ethnic and
religious groups erupted on at least three different fronts, all
north of the capital. There have been reports of heavy casualties
on at least two fronts.
	   _Rockets fired by the alliance have hit residential areas of
Kabul, killing civilians. One rocket last month killed a family of
five.
	   _A Taliban jet dropped a bomb on a market place in northern
Taloqan killed 30 people.
	   Annan also took the combatants' alleged backers to task.
	   ``The key to solving the Afghan tragedy lies in whether or not
the international community have the resolve to address its
external aspects _ namely the continuous foreign interference in
the form of arms and other supplies to the warring factions,''
Annan says in his report.
	   Military aid to the warring factions continues to pour in from
allies outside the country. It is widely believed that the Taliban
is receiving aid from Pakistan and money from Saudi Arabia and that
Russia, the central Asian countries and Iran are helping the
northern alliance.
	   Afghanistan's neighbors have all denied helping the warring
groups.
	   The Taliban, which espouses a harsh and restrictive brand of
Islam, controls about 85 percent of Afghanistan and their enemies
the remaining 15 percent.
	   Despite its frustrations, Annan said the U.N. would ``continue
addressing the Afghan question vigorously.''
	   A meeting of Afghanistan's six neighbors -- Iran, Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and China -- as well as the
United States and Russia is expected to be convened in July in New
York, according to U.N. officials in Pakistan.

Clinton defends close U.S.-China ties as important for world's future AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>

By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ Welcomed with ancient pageantry, U.S.
President Bill Clinton began his journey through China with a
declaration Thursday that commitment to human dignity and freedom
is as ``vital to the strength and success'' of this nation as it is
in America.
	   Clinton came to pursue at the summit, at village roundtables,
with communists and with stockbrokers the East-West relationship he
calls crucial to peace and stability in the 21st century.
	   He had said he would be striving for the advancement of
political and human rights, an issue rankling a Congress divided
over his policy of cordial engagement and investigating his prior
deals with Beijing. A reminder of that political stress _ six
members of Congress, all Democrats, traveled with him, on an
invitation the administration said Republicans spurned.
	   Thus, the extravagant ceremonial welcome at the South Gate of
the Old City of Xi'an opened a presidential mission disputed at
home. Even the sendoff was marred by formal diplomatic protest
after China revoked visas to bar three reporters for Radio Free
Asia, a U.S. government broadcaster nettlesome to Beijing.
	   Clinton spoke first of U.S.-China accord, not discord. ``We
Americans admire your accomplishments, your economy, your hard work
and vision, your efforts against hunger and poverty, your work with
us on peace and stability in Korea and South Asia,'' Clinton said.
	   Then the polite lecture:
	   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' he told a throng in the old city. ``In this global
information age, where both economic growth and equal opportunity
are based on ideas, a commitment to providing all human beings the
opportunity to develop their full potential is vital to the
strength and success of the new China as well.''
	   As for the critics, Clinton said: ``There may be those here and
back in America who wonder whether closer ties and deeper
friendship between China and America are good.''
	   ``Clearly, the answer is yes,'' he said. ``We have a powerful
ability to help each other grow.''
	   Clinton delighted the crowd by opening his speech with a few
words of Chinese: ``Ni, hao ma?'' _ which means ``Hello, how are
you?'' He closed by saying ``Thank you'' in Chinese.
	   Air Force One landed in the murky dusk of a city shrouded by
chronic smog. At the formal welcoming rites, giant red-globe
lanterns reflected in the floodlights along the 200-yard, broad red
carpet that was Clinton's path to his greeting.
	   It was a rainbow scene of gowns, costumes, elaborate headdresses
of dynasties long past, of customed as warriors parading to bow to
the president, of dancers waving banners and scarlet globes on
lofty staffs, all amid the music of gongs, flutes and drums.
	   The pageant was styled an ``emperor's welcome,'' after rituals
dating from the 7th century rulers of imperial China. Xi'an Mayor
Feng Xichu presented Clinton the ceremonial gold key to the city.
	   But there was no easing the controversy, as a congressional
committee in Washington heard testimony on alleged leaks of U.S.
missile technology to China, while a Beijing official defended the
satellite deals involved.
	   The foreign ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said Wednesday
that cooperation on satellite launches ``benefits both sides. Those
who are in the mainstream of bilateral relations should have a
correct view.''
	   Tang dismissed U.S. investigations as ``a wave of noise in the
United States that is intended to obstruct the development of
bilateral relations with the United States. We believe it by no
means represents the attitude of most American people.''
	   Clinton views his nine-day mission to China, the first by an
American president since George Bush's in February 1989, as the
right way to increase America's impact on human rights, nuclear
weapons spread and efforts to stabilize shaken Asian economies.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' Clinton said
at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, where his plane stopped to
refuel.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' he told about 4,000 people
who turned out to see him on his way.
	   But even as Clinton flew to China, Chinese police arrested two
dissidents in a display of Beijing's hard line against
pro-democracy activists.
	   The gritty industrial city surrounding Xi'an was primped,
painted and flag-decked for Clinton's arrival.
	   On Friday, Clinton goes to the village of Xia He for what is
billed as a roundtable discussion with ordinary Chinese citizens
about their lives in a changing society. He'll speak in the village
square. Then Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, are
tourists for an afternoon, visiting the unearthed terra cotta
warriors, pottery soldiers fashioned to guard an emperor in the
afterlife.
	   Then to Beijing on Saturday, opening with the event that has
stirred the greatest controversy at home: a formal welcoming in
Tiananmen Square, scene of the democracy demonstrations bloodily
repressed by Chinese troops in June 1989.
	   Clinton defends his decision to go to that symbolic site as
protocol, not substance, and said he will speak America's piece for
human rights and freedom. But not there; no speeches at Tiananmen.

World Cup: Belgium leads South Korea 1-0 at halftime 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Belgium took an early lead in a crucial World Cup
first round game against South Korea Thursday when Luc Nilis shot
home from close range. With the Netherlands leading Mexico 2-0 in a
parallel match, the Belgians looked set to continue into the second
round.
	   A header from Gordan Vidovic was pushed off the line in the
seventh minute by a South Korean defender, but Nilis surged into
the area to volley in the much-needed opener past diving goalkeeper
Kim Byung-ji.
	   Belgium needed a win to have any chance of advancing. But its
starting lineup did not reflect a more offensive spirit than the
one that got a 2-2 draw against Mexico.
	   Goalkeeper Filip De Wilde, suffering from strained abductors was
replaced by Philippe Vande Walle, and veteran captain Franky Van
der Elst was rested after the draining game against Mexico. Also,
midfielder Philippe Clement stood in for Danny Boffin, who is out
with a left knee injury.
	   South Korean coach Kim Pyung-Soek _ promoted after Cha Bum-kin
was fired following the team's dismal 5-0 loss to the Netherlands _
made few changes to Cha's starting lineup against the Dutch.
	   Although already eliminated from the tournament, the South
Koreans appeared determined to win their first match in five World
Cup appearances _ their last opportunity before co-hosting the next
World Cup with Japan in 2002.
	   They demonstrated tight defending and an ability to shoot from
distance, but also bouts of tactical naivete that the experienced
Belgians _ fielding a team whose average age is over 30 _ were
quick to take advantage of.
	   In the 22nd minute, forward Seo Jung-won ran down a long pass,
but although completely unmarked, fumbled the shot from some 12
meters, the ball bouncing off his shin and shooting past the post.
	   Lineups:
	   Belgium_Philippe Vande Walle; Eric Deflandre, Gordan Vidovic,
Lorenzo Staelens, Vital Borkelmans; Enzo Scifo, Philippe Clement,
Marc Wilmots, Nico Van Kerckhoven; Luis Oliveira, Luc Nilis.

Top Thai brewer introduces cheaper beer to fend off rival 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's top brewer, Boon Rawd, has
launched a new cheap beer to compete with a low-priced rival that
has cut deeply into its market share.
	   The new beer named Leo _ short for Leopard _ is expected to
capture 10 percent of the market within two years, the company said
in a news release received Thursday.
	   As recently as two years ago, Boon Rawd held about an 80 percent
share of the 40 billion baht (dlrs 952 million) beer market, mainly
through sales of its flagship Singha brand.
	   But government deregulation of the sector in 1990 opened the
door to serious competition, and one particularly well-financed
rival decided to try to capture the low end of the market by
underpricing Singha.
	   With the launch of Leo beer on Wednesday, Boon Rawd is going
head to head with Chang (Elephant) beer, the low-priced competitor
aggressively marketed by a rival group whose main product is
whiskey.
	   Boon Rawd now holds about a 48 percent share of the beer market,
with brands produced by Chang's makers _ including Carlsberg _ also
holding 48 percent. Chang is estimated to have a 30 percent market
share.

Pagans appeal for unity and understanding 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP)_A congress of pagans on Thursday called
for pagan unity around the world, and also appealed for greater
tolerance of their beliefs.
	   A resolution adopted at the close of the five-day World Pagan
Congress i n Vilnius said pagans should network and become more
active in the societies in which they live.
	   ``We encourage pagans of the world to strengthen their
solidarity, and seek membership in international institutions, and
we urge societies to be tolerant of our beliefs,'' the statement
said.
	   Some members of the congress complained that their beliefs were
not accorded the same respect as established religions, and said
pro-pagan organizations were often unable to secure any official
recognition.
	   The gathering brought together about 150 pagan ethusiasts from
15 countries, including India and the United States.
	   Lithuania was the last nation in Europe to be converted to
Christianity. Before the conversion around 1400, Lithuanians
worshipped many different deities, including Perkunas, the god of
thunder.
	   Since independence in 1991, the predominantly Roman Catholic
country has seen a rise in groups advocating pre-Christian beliefs.
Romuva,one of the largest and most outspoken pagan groups in
Lithuania, says it is dedicated to founding a pagan university in
Vilnius.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's opposition-dominated parliament decided
Thursday to delay consideration of a package of emergency economic
measures until next week despite Kremlin pressure for speedy
approval.
	   The measures are needed to implement a new budget-cutting,
revenue-raising plan designed to win new loans from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Russia's financial markets have been falling for months, with
investors put off by the Asian crisis, plummeting oil prices and
the possibility of social unrest.
	   The IMF was to decide later Thursday whether to release a
delayed dlrs 670 installment of an existing loan. A decision on
Russia's request for a new, dlrs 10-15 billion loan is expected to
take several weeks.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko submitted the austerity plan to
the IMF on Wednesday, and asked parliament's lower house to pass
the necessary legislation quickly.
	   Kiriyenko said that if the bills are passed into law, they will
bring Russia's monthly budget revenues up to 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 4 billion), Russian news agencies reported.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said that the package of six
tax reform bills, which the Cabinet approved Thursday before
sending to it to the Duma, should net the budget almost 37 billion
rubles (dlrs 6 billion) annually.
	   In spite of the government's request for quick action, the Duma
scheduled debate of the proposed legislation for July 1 _ just two
days before it is scheduled to recess for the summer.
	   Kiriyenko promised that the Cabinet was ready to work with
parliament and that its members _ in contrast to the legislative
branch _ were ``ready to put off all vacations and trips,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   But he warned that ``without the passing of these draft laws,
the anti-crisis program will not work,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The Duma is dominated by Communists and other hard-liners who
oppose President Boris Yeltsin and his economic policies.
	   On Thursday, it put off a preliminary vote on proposed
privatization legislation until its next session, which begins in
September.
	   The program, designed to increase parliament's input in the
privatization process, sets out methods for privatizing state
property and lists the state companies that will be sold.
	   The ruble sank against the dollar on Thursday, in spite of the
Central Bank's apparent expenditure of hundreds of millions of
dollars in reserves to defend the Russian currency.
	   Investors are nervous that an IMF aid package for Russian
markets wouldn't come soon enough to stave off collapse, and many
have been selling on fears of a devaluation.
	   In other economic news, the Ministry of Trade and Industry
suspended commercial banks' gold exports, saying they didn't have
the right to sell commodities.
	   The sales are vital to Russia's cash-starved gold industry, as
commercial banks are expected to finance around 60 percent of the
nation's gold production this year, said Sergei Kyshtymov, head of
the Central Bank's precious metals department. The bank has
protested the suspension.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish woman likes men in uniform _
so much that she patted a policeman's behind and got fined 300
kroner (dlrs 43).
	   Ulla Isendam said she saw officer Henrik Basse one day and
couldn't resist ``his cute little bum,'' the newspaper Berlingske
Tidende reported Thursday.
	   Basse was affronted and took the 28-year-old woman to the local
police station in Hilleroed, 35 kilometers (22 miles) north of
Copenhagen, and charged her with injury to his integrity and
indecent behavior.
	   Basse sued her for 5,000 kroner, basing the amount on awards
given to three female police officers who had been similarly
handled. But the Hilleroed town court imposed a lower fine.
	   The fine may have depleted Isendam's wallet, but hasn't stilled
her blood.
	   ``I still get turned on by men in uniforms so I guess I can't
resist tapping more behinds in the future,'' the newspaper Ekstra
Bladet quoted her as saying.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In phase two of a swap with Lebanese
guerrillas, Israel on Thursday awaited the return of the body of an
Israeli soldier killed in an ambush last year.
	   Just hours before the planned exchange of the remains for scores
of Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas, two Israeli soldiers were
killed by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, but the violence was not
expected to scuttle the deal.
	   In Lebanon, officials from the Amal and Hezbollah guerrilla
groups, handed over body remains in their possession to the
Lebanese Army.
	   As several hundred people watched from balconies or gathered on
a street in south Beirut, Lebanese army medics transferred the
remains, placed in an icebox, from a Hezbollah ambulance to the
army ambulance outside a Hezbollah office.
	   The army ambulance then took off for Beirut airport, escorted by
other army vehicles.

Environment ministers agree on more openness towards citizens 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Environment ministers from 36
European countries and former Soviet republics on Thursday promised
more transparency in their governments' decision-making, and
pledged that citizens and environmental groups would be allowed to
test their decisions before courts of law.
	   The convention signed at the end of a three-day conference in
northern Denmark, stated that each country must improve public
information on environmental matters and citizens must be consulted
when governments take concrete decisions concerning the
environment.
	   ``We're making real progress. The convention has the potential
to become global if Africa, Asia and Latin America join in,'' said
Svend Auken, Denmark's environment minister and host of the
conference held in Aarhus, 180 kilometers (112 miles) northwest of
Copenhagen.
	   His Swedish colleague, Anna Lindh, said it was ``a step in the
right direction. But there still is a long way to go.''
	   The governments that signed the document said that once it is
ratified by their national parliaments, citizens would be given the
right to test government decisions on environmental matters before
national courts of law.
	   Russia and Hungary said they would sign the Aarhus convention
later. Germany declined to sign saying it couldn't join such
international agreements which would conflict with the German
states' own legislation.
	   On Wednesday, 30 European countries agreed on a total phase-out
of lead in petrol by the year 2005. While unleaded gas is available
in most western European countries, leaded petrol still accounts
for a large share of the market in eastern Europe.
	   The conference also signed protocols on long-range pollution
caused by heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants to reduce
airborne pollution.

Former communist security officers appeal prison sentences 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ An appeals court began deliberating
Thursday whether to shorten the prison sentences for 10 former
communist secret security officers convicted of torturing
pro-democracy activists.
	   The main defendant, Col. Adam Humer, 81, a former high official
at the communist Ministry of Public Security, was sentenced to nine
years imprisonment for beating and intimidating people during
interrogations.
	   His laywer says the sentence is 1 1/2 years longer than what is
recommended under Poland's penal code.
	   The so-called ``Humer trial'' in 1996 has been the only
prosecution of communist security officers for brutal treatment of
prisoners.
	   The appeals court said it will announce its decision July 2.

	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton made this
ancient city his first stop in China for both ceremonial and
practical reasons.
	   Xi'an, an industrial city in northern China, was imperial
China's capital for 1,100 years. It was home to emperor Qin
Shihuangdi, the ruler who unified China, and also boasts thousands
of life-sized terra cotta warriors buried in pits to guard Qin's
spirit.
	   The Xi'an starting point also was designed to give Clinton a
low-key stop to help counter the effects of jet lag before his
meetings starting Friday with President Jiang Zemin in Beijing.
	   A similar schedule was set up for Jiang when he visited the
United States last October. He arrived first in Hawaii, then
visited historic Williamsburg, Virginia, a major city of colonial
America, before heading to Washington.

Police detain dissident in Xi'an: Clinton's first stop in China the first. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to ADD that Zhao's letter on Tiananmen Square is not
By JOHN LEICESTER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have detained two dissidents at the first
stop on President Clinton's China itinerary, a human rights group
said. Police surveillance of other democracy activists remained
tight Thursday.
	   Yan Jun, who joined in a letter signed by 70 people asking
Clinton to meet dissidents, was taken away from his home in Xi'an
Wednesday, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   Yan's whereabouts were unknown Thursday, the day of Clinton's
planned arrival in the north China city, the Hong Kong-based group
added.
	   Also detained Wednesday was Li Zhiying, a county official in
Chengcheng, about 125 kilometers (80 miles) northeast of Xi'an, who
was in frequent contact with other Xi'an dissidents and had
previously signed petitions to the government, the group said.
	   Letters and petitions are among the few recourses for Chinese
who take issue with government policy. Even former Communist Party
leader Zhao Ziyang, under house arrest since the June 3-4, 1989,
crackdown on democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square, has
resorted to penning his grievances.
	   The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported Wednesday that
Zhao wrote a letter to party leaders urging them to use the
occasion of Clinton's visit to reconsider their condemnation of the
Tiananmen protests as ``counterrevolutionary turmoil.''
	   ``The shadow of the June 4 Tiananmen incident should be cast
off. We should face the new century under the light of democracy,''
the newspaper quoted Zhao's letter as saying.
	   One Chinese source with contacts to Zhao's family said he
believed the letter was written with Zhao's knowledge, if not by
Zhao himself. Zhao is not allowed contact with the media, and
former associates of his reached by phone said that while they had
not seen any letter, its message was in keeping with Zhao's point
of view.
	   ``I certainly believe it represents Zhao's point of view,'' said
former aide Bao Tong, who spent seven years in prison for his
association with the liberal leader. ``The whole world can
understand his point of view.''
	   Clinton was due to arrive in Xi'an Thursday evening, kicking off
his nine-day visit, the first by a U.S. president since the
Tiananmen crackdown.
	   In a radio interview before his departure Wednesday, Clinton
said he wanted his trip to be a springboard for the causes of
democracy and freedom in China's closed society.
	   Zhao wrote at least one such letter before. In September 1997,
human rights groups said he appealed to party leaders at the start
of their congress to reassess the Tiananmen Square protests.

World Cup: Africa soccer group denounces tournament refereeing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The African Football Confederation charged Thursday
that teams from the continent had been victimized by ``one-sided''
refereeing at the World Cup and urged FIFA to ``repair prejudice''
that resulted in the elimination of African teams.
	   ``In effect, contrary to all the other teams that have
qualified, a special treatment seems to have been reserved for the
representatives of Africa,'' Mustapha Fahmy, general secretary of
the confederation,'' said in a statement issued in France.
	   Fahmy's statement asserted that refereeing errors had resulted
in the elimination of Cameroon in the first round and also
prevented Morocco from advancing to the second round.
	   Tunisia and South Africa also failed to advance. Nigeria was the
only one of five African teams to reach the round of 16.
	   ``Faced with this situation, all of African soccer suffers from
a profound unease: A feeling that her representatives are
undesirables on the grandest stage of soccer on the planet,''
Fahmy's statement said.
	   His confederation, which is based in Cairo, urged the world
soccer federation to take ``all necessary measures'' to ``rule out
prejudice caused by one-sided refereeing of which our
representatives have been the victim ...''
	   The same rules would be applied to all the teams still in the
competition ``no matter what their origins,'' the statement said.
The 32-nation tournament began June 10 and runs through July 12.
	   David Will, chief of the FIFA referee office, said earlier
Thursday that charges of political favoritism in refereeing were
``just ridiculous.''
	   ``The referees are not the slightest bit interested in the
political situation,'' he said. ``They are simply refereeing the
game. They don't even known who the two teams are. They go from
match to match and round to round,'' Will said at a press
conference in which he defending the quality of refereeing at the
World Cup.
	   On Tuesday, Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner nullified a goal
that would have put Cameroon ahead of Chile 2-1, calling Patrick
Mboma for pushing off a defender. Replays showed contact, but no
clear foul. The 1-1 tie, coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory over
Austria, meant Chile advanced and Cameroon was out.
	   That sparked attacks in the Cameroon capital of Yaounde by black
fans on white-owned businesses and harsh words from the government.
	   ``What we saw is not a World Cup competition. It has been a
festival of scandal,'' Youth and Sports Minister Joseph Owona told
the African Nation newspaper.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A balcony holding more than 100 spectators, mostly
children, collapsed Thursday onto the crowded floor of a sports
stadium in southern Russia, killing 23 people, officials said.
Thirty-nine others were injured.
	   ``People started screaming,'' said Vladimir Sherbakov, a local
sports journalist who was covering a four-day wrestling tournament
in the stadium. ``There was panic, but everybody's first reaction
was shock.''
	   The accident occurred at about 11:40 a.m. (0740 GMT) at the
start of a Russian National Freestyle Wrestling Competition, when a
50-meter-long (160-foot-long) concrete balcony fell about 5 meters
(16 feet) onto the spectators underneath.
	   Immediately after the balcony collapsed, wrestlers and some of
the estimated 2,500 people in the audience rushed to help those
trapped under the balcony.
	   ``Within 10 minutes the wrestlers had lifted the fallen pieces
off and freed the people underneath,'' Sherbakov said.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in the southern city of Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers
(850 miles) south of Moscow in the Kabardino-Balkaraya republic.
	   According to Sherbakov, the stadium was in poor condition.
Construction on the complex began 15 years ago, but the complex,
designed for track and field events, was not finished until 1994
because of funding problems.
	   ``It could have collapsed because of poor construction, but
there were also too many people on the balcony,'' he said.
	   Sherbakov described the balcony as a standing room only area
where non-paying spectators could watch the event. As a result,
most of those on the balcony were children who couldn't afford
tickets, he said.
	   The event, he said, was ``very big for our city and our
republic, with participants from all around Russia. There were lots
of people there.''
	   By mid-afternoon rescue workers said they had found all those
killed or wounded when the balcony fell.
	   Aleksander Khashkhovov, assistant to Kabardino-Balkaraya
president Valery Kokov, said the collapse occurred because the
stadium was old. But NTV television said local police believe that
negligence in the construction process may have been responsible.
	   A criminal investigation has been opened into the incident.
	   Shoddy construction and poor maintenance are endemic in Russia,
where funds for construction and repair of public buildings have
all but disappeared since the Soviet collapse.

Turkey, Switzerland at odds over palace 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Ties with Switzerland have soured over
Swiss officials' refusal to allow Ankara the use of a palace to
mark the 75th anniversary of a treaty that defined Turkey's
boundaries, an official said Thursday.
	   ``We have certain problems with Switzerland,'' Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said. ``We are pursuing our efforts to
overcome these problems.''
	   Local Swiss authorities refused to allow Turkey the use of the
Palais de Rumine where the Treaty of Lausanne, signed on July 24,
1923, settled the borders of modern Turkey, newspaper reports said.
	   The treaty was negotiated after Turkey, rejecting the 1919
Treaty of Sevres that carved up the Ottoman Empire and established
a Kurdish state, fought to win back its Aegean coast and southeast
regions.
	   The mayor of Lausanne reportedly refused to lend the palace,
saying he would rather commemorate the Treaty of Sevres than the
Lausanne treaty.
	   The Swiss embassy refused comment.

Talks underway but coalition not in sight 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Zeman meeting Ruml
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Talks on the future government
continued for the second day Thursday, but formation of a stable
coalition still appears to be weeks away.
	   The leader of the Social Democrats, Milos Zeman met with the
Christian Democrat's leader Josef Lux Thursday to try and figure
out how the two parties could work within the same Cabinet.
	   Zeman's party won last week's elections, but have only 74 seats
in the 200-seat legislature, and lacks obvious center-left allies
that could give him a majority needed to form a government.
	   ``At this stage, we are discussing different coalition
combinations,'' Zeman told Czech radio after the meeting with Lux.
``Some of them are acceptable, some are not.''
	   Negotiations for the future Cabinet began almost immediately
following the elections _ held two years early in a vain attempt to
overcome a political deadlock _ but are expected to take weeks.
	   While Zeman is leaning towards a minority two-party government
with the center-right Christian Democrats, Lux fears that in such a
scenario, the government could fall hostage to the old-guard
Communists.
	   The Communists are the third strongest with 24 seats, but all
four remaining parties have rejected them as coalition partners,
due to their past and lack of will to reform.
	   Communist leader Miroslav Grebenicek has repeatedly said his
party could support a coalition of Social Democrats and Christian
Democrats.
	   Lux therefore wants also the Freedom Union of Jan Ruml to join
Zeman's government.
	   ``In such a grand coalition ... we would defend right-wing
values, as is usual in grand coalitions,'' Lux told the radio.
	   Zeman, who met with Ruml later Thursday, told journalists he
made ``certain proposals'' to Ruml's party and said it was now up
to the Freedom Union to discuss them.
	   But Ruml repeatedly rejected the idea of a coalition with the
Social Democrats.
	   ``This phase of negotiations is only informative and I told Mr.
Zeman that our stand is unchangeable,'' Ruml said.
	   His party seems to prefer a center-right government formed with
Lux and the election runner-up, Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a stable coalition,
President Vaclav Havel will likely ask Klaus to attempt the same.
Klaus' party won 63 seats in the elections.
	   Zeman was scheduled to inform Havel of progress made late
Thursday.

Gingrich to support trade extension for China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ As U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in
China, a major critic of his China policy was speaking out at home
in favor of extending normal trade relations with the Chinese
government.
	   House Speaker Newt Gingrich called a news conference to outline
his position on ``most-favored-nation'' trade status for China and
other trade issues, including giving the president authority to
negotiate free-trade agreements with Latin American countries.
	   Gingrich and other Republican leaders, including Majority Leader
Dick Armey, have supported keeping normal trade relations with
China in the past. But they have said extending the status will be
more difficult this year because of rising anger over China's
human-rights and weapons proliferation policies.
	   Congress must vote this summer whether to disapprove Clinton's
decision to extend most-favored-nation status for another year.
	   Gingrich also was to address the issues of how Republican
leaders intend to restart stalled debate on providing the
International Monetary Fund $3.5 billion for emergency uses and
helping U.S. agricultural exports hit by sanctions against India
and Pakistan.

Borderline calls in key spots put refs in spotlight calls'' AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with African soccer confederation blasting ``one-sided
By LARRY SIDDONS
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The chief of World Cup referees defended his
embattled brigade Thursday, saying the quality of officiating was
higher than four years ago and that new evidence supported a
questionable call by a U.S. referee in a key match.
	   David Will, a Scottish lawyer who has run FIFA's referee office
for eight years, said overall officiating in the first 40 games
averaged 8.3 points out of 10, and marks were getting better as the
tournament progressed. Most games were graded between 8 and 9 by
the officiating supervisors, he said.
	   Refereeing in three of the first 40 games was judged
unsatisfactory, Will said. He refused to identify the matches but
said none of the sub-par grades involved red or yellow cards and
that all were judged ``on overall performance throughout a match,
not one decision that might have been off target.''
	   Will said the last World Cup in 1994 in the United States
produced four unsatisfactorily refereed matches, all in the first
round when there were fewer games than at this World Cup.
	   ``We remain generally satisfied with the performance of the
referees,'' he said. ``The overall standard remains high _ higher
than in the United States, to be sure. ''
	   Will spoke at a news conference as criticism of the referees
came from all directions.
	   Players and coaches said the referees were inconsistent. FIFA
president Sepp Blatter said they were too soft on hard fouls. A
government minister in Cameroon said they were part of an
anti-African plot.
	   The African Football Confederation charged Thursday that teams
from the continent had been victimized by ``one-sided'' refereeing
and urged FIFA to ``repair prejudice'' that resulted in the
elimination of African teams.
	   ``In effect, contrary to all the other teams that have
qualified, a special treatment seems to have been reserved for the
representatives of Africa,'' Mustapha Fahmy, general secretary of
the confederation,'' said in a statement issued in France.
	   Fahmy's statement asserted that refereeing errors had resulted
in the elimination of Cameroon in the first round and also
prevented Morocco from advancing to the second round.
	   But Will said that charges of political favoritism in refereeing
were ``just ridiculous.''
	   ``The referees are not the slightest bit interested in the
political situation,'' he said. ``They are simply refereeing the
game. They don't even known who the two teams are. They go from
match to match and round to round,'' Will said.
	   Will said his 34 men were doing their job properly.
	   ``The referees play it straight,'' he said. ``They call it as
they see it. They don't have the benefit of replays from five
angles.''
	   Esse Baharmast of the United States called a foul on Junior
Baiano of Brazil that set up the winning penalty kick in Norway's
2-1 victory Tuesday. That moved Norway into the second round and
eliminated Morocco, a 3-0 winner over Scotland.
	   Initial replays showed contact but no clear foul. But Will
pointed to photos taken from the Norwegian television network NRK
that show Baiano clearly grabbing the jersey of the Norwegian
player, T.A. Flo, in the penalty area.
	   Will, who generally will not discuss individual calls or games,
went out of his way to defend Baharmast.
	   ``The referee, from his angle, took a decision and played it as
he saw it, direct and straightforward,'' the official said. ``You
can look at television and photographs and pictures on the
Internet. But at the end of the day, the referee has to make a
decision on the field in a split second as he sees it.''
	   On Tuesday, Hungarian referee Laszlo Vagner nullified a goal
that would have put Cameroon ahead of Chile 2-1, calling Patrick
Mboma for pushing off a defender. Replays showed contact, but no
clear foul. The 1-1 tie, coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory over
Austria, meant Chile advanced and Cameroon was out.
	   That sparked attacks in the Cameroon capital of Yaounde by black
fans on white-owned businesses and harsh words from the government.
	   ``What we saw is not a World Cup competition. It has been a
festival of scandal,'' Youth and Sports Minister Joseph Owona told
the African Nation newspaper.
	   Nor did Will believe that the refs had been influenced by
Blatter's call for more punishment against players who tackle from
behind or make other dangerous moves.
	   The 15 expulsions for rough play in the first 40 games _ equal
to the total of four years ago _ was ``not higher than the number
that we reasonably would have expected,'' Will said. He said the
explosion of five red cards in two games the day after Blatter's
comments, compared with four in the previous 20 games, was ``pure
chance.''

Colin Jackson targets British Grand Prix to break record 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Colin Jackson will use the British Grand Prix at
Sheffield on Aug.2 as the venue for an attempt to break his own
110-meter hurdles record.
	   Jackson, who is hoping to regain the world's No. 1 spot this
season from American Alan Johnson, has the added incentive of a
50,000-pound (dlrs 83,300) bonus if he betters his world record of
12.91 seconds.
	   ``It is great to be back on form and I feel that anything is
possible this year. I would love to break at least my own British
all-comers' record in Sheffield,'' he said.

Kendall and Everton part by mutual consent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Howard Kendall ended his third term as Everton
manager Thursday, leaving the Premier League team ``by mutual
consent.''
	   The announcement Thursday ended weeks of speculation about
Kendall's tenure at Everton, which narrowly avoided relegation last
season.
	   Kendall's assistant Adrian Heath will act as caretaker boss
until the club appoints a new manager.
	   Kendall, touted as a future England manager after steering
Everton to two F.A. Cup titles and a European Cup Winners Cup
between 1985 and 1987, said last season had been the most difficult
of his career.
	   ``I leave with regrets but I know our supporters will understand
this club deserves success,'' he said.
	   Everton now faces the same predicament it did when Kendall was
invited to return a third time last June.
	   He took control after three other prospective managers rejected
the job. He arrived within days of pre-season training and missed
the summer's transfer activity.
	   His 1997 campaign was hindered by financial contraints and the
Merseyside team's inability to lure high-profile players.
	   Kendall's second stint at Everton ended in a similar fashion.
	   He had returned to Goodison Park in 1990 after masterminding
Manchester City's successful fight against relegation.
	   But he quit in December 1993 when Everton was struggling.

Prosecution attacks Serb defendant in massacre trial 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Prosecutors on Thursday
relentlessly attacked a Serb ex-mayor standing trial on charges
that he played a key role in the 1991 massacre of 200 Croats and
non-Serbs.
	   U.N. prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their closing
arguments before the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal as the 28-day
trial ended for Slavko Dokmanovic.
	   The defendant, former mayor of the eastern Croatian city of
Vukovar, has pleaded innocent. He faces up to life imprisonment if
convicted; Judge Antonio Cassese of Italy said a verdict was
expected within two weeks.
	   Prosecutors have charged Dokmanovic with six counts of war
crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged participation in
the massacre near Vukovar, believed to be the worst atrocity of the
1991 Serb-Croat war.
	   ``The facts remain, the dead bodies remain ... and all the
revisionist history the defense has presented can't change that,''
said prosecutor Clint Williamson.
	   According to prosecutors, the horrific day of Nov. 20, 1991,
began at Vukovar's hospital, where hundreds of people had sought
refuge after the city fell to forces of the Yugoslav National Army,
known as the JNA.
	   More than 200 Croatian and others from the hospital were rounded
up by JNA and Serb paramilitary soldiers and transported to a
nearby farm where they were beaten.
	   Afterwards, they were taken to a ravine where they were shot and
buried by a bulldozer in a mass grave, prosecutors allege. Since
then, the remains of these victims have been exhumed.
	   Prosecutors said Dokmanovic is responsible for his active
participation in these incidents and for his failure to prevent and
stop the crimes as a civic leader.
	   ``Dokmanovic gave a blessing to the sadistic outpouring of
violence,'' Williamson said.
	   Perpetrators ``turned at least 200 living, breathing persons ...
into a jumble of dead bodies decomposing in an isolated grave,'' he
said.
	   Defense lawyer Toma Fila doggedly insisted the defendant was not
at any of the crime scenes, and that he lacked the military clout
to stop the ethnic violence around him.
	   Fila attacked and mocked the prosecution's arguments, calling
them ``Mickey Mouse proof.''
	   ``You have no proof at all, you just have assumptions,'' he
said.
	   Dokmanovic sat slightly hunched over on the table during
Thursday's session, and showed no outward signs of emotion.
	   Characterizing Dokmanovic, 48, as a family man with no previous
criminal record, Fila asked: ``Can that kind of person take part in
the killing of 200 persons?''
	   Three JNA officers also have been charged with responsibility
for the massacre, but they remain at large.
	   The U.N. tribunal, set up in 1993 by the Security Council, has
publicly indicted 60 people and has issued an unknown number of
secret indictments.

Chinese nuclear and missile aid to Pakistan worsened security, India says 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The concerns about neighbors Pakistan
and China that prompted India to test nuclear weapons last month
were raised again Thursday, in an annual reviews by government
defense and foreign affairs experts.
	   ``China's extensive defense collaboration .... assistance to
Pakistan's nuclear program and sale of missiles and sophisticated
weapons remain a source of concern,'' the government said.
	   Beijing has denied helping Islamabad's nuclear programs and has
said it did not violate international laws when it sold missile
technology to Pakistan.
	   Pakistan responded to a series of Indian nuclear tests in May
with tests of its own, prompting fears their long-standing rivalry
could one day erupt into nuclear war.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif have agreed to meet next month on the
sidelines of a regional summit in Sri Lanka, the Indian Ocean
island nation off India's southeast coast.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since both gained
independence from Britain in 1947. Two of the wars were over the
Himalayan state of Kashmir, two thirds of which is controlled by
New Delhi and the rest by Islamabad.
	   The Indian Defense Ministry report said China maintains one of
the largest armies in the world.
	   China and India fought a border war in 1962. Talks have helped
thaw relations in recent years, although little progress has been
made to resolve the border dispute.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Beefed-up patrols of German border
guards stopped more than 10,000 travelers Thursday and detained at
least 14 suspected hooligans in their push to prevent violence at
World Cup matches in France.
	   The Interior Ministry, which announced the arrests, posted 1,000
extra border guards Wednesday as a precaution against violence
during Thursday night's game between Germany and Iran in
Montpellier, France.
	   Police checked trains en route to France as well as stopping
cars at the border. Seven of those detained were train passengers
who were carrying dangerous items. All the suspected hooligans had
their passports taken away.
	   The border checks came after 180 German thugs clashed with
French police on Sunday during the Germany-Yugoslavia game. A
police officer was beaten comatose.
	   French authorities placed Markus Warnecke, 27, of Hanover, and
Steffen Karl Elschner, 26, of Braunschweig, under formal
investigation Tuesday night in connection with the beating. Formal
investigation is one step short of being charged.
	   German police said Thursday they were investigating a third
suspect in the beating, a resident of the western city of
Gelsenkirchen identified only as Andrei Z., 27.
	   Police said he has participated in soccer hooliganism since
1991. His whereabouts were unknown.

Oldest human footprints survive move unharmed

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The oldest human footprints yet
discovered were undamaged after being moved to the safety of a
museum, it was announced on Thursday.
	   Traveling by helicopter and truck, a stone block containing the
117,000-year-old fossils, dubbed ``Eve's Footprints,'' was taken 75
miles (120 kilometers) from the shores of Langebaan Lagoon to Cape
Town's South African Museum.
	   Set in the crumbly sandstone of the shores of the lagoon, the
delicate footprints had been under threat from vandals and erosion.
	   But it was not known if the footprints had survived their trip
in one piece until Dave Roberts, who discovered them in 1995, and
other geologists unscrewed protective metal casing and lifted off a
solid mass of preservative resin.
	   To Roberts obvious relief the footprints were intact.
	   ``Wow! There we go. They are in one piece,'' he sighed.
	   The footprints, 8 1/2 inches (20 centimeters) long, were made by
a person about 5-foot-3 inches (160 centimeters) tall.
	   The small stature led scientists to suggest they were made by a
young woman.
	   Laid on a rain swept sloping dune, they were quickly buried by
windblown sand and gradually turned to stone.
	   Although much older footprints of apelike human ancestors exist,
the tracks are the oldest prints made by anatomically modern
humans, indistinguishable from people living today.
	   The prints will eventually go on public display in Cape Town,
though it is hoped they will one day return to Langebaan to be
housed in a specially built museum.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's opposition-dominated parliament decided
Thursday to delay consideration of a package of emergency economic
measures until next week despite Kremlin pressure for speedy
approval.
	   The measures are needed to implement a new budget-cutting,
revenue-raising plan designed to win new loans from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Russia's financial markets have been falling for months, with
investors put off by the Asian crisis, plummeting oil prices and
the possibility of social unrest.
	   The IMF was to decide later Thursday whether to release a
delayed dlrs 670 installment of an existing loan. A decision on
Russia's request for a new, dlrs 10-15 billion stabilization loan
is expected to take several weeks.
	   Japan's ambassador to Russia, Takehiro Togo, said Thursday that
his country and Russia's other partners in the Group of Eight
leading industrialized countries would support the IMF's granting
of such a loan.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Popular Algerian singer Lounes Matoub,
who survived an earlier kidnapping by Muslim militants and only
recently returned from exile, was killed near his Berber hometown
Thursday.
	   It was the latest assassination of an Algerian artist during a
6-year-old Muslim insurgency that has left more than 75,000 people
dead.
	   Matoub, 42, who like other Berbers fiercely criticized both the
military-backed government and Muslim militants, was killed outside
the village of Oued Aissi, near the Berber regional capital of
Tizi-Ouzou in eastern Algeria.
	   Living in exile in France since his 1994 kidnapping, Matoub had
only returned to Algeria this month. The militants have killed
other singers including Cheb Hasni, as well as intellectuals.
	   ``He had the courage to denounce, to speak out,'' Algeria's
best-known singer Cheb Khaled said in a radio interview in France,
where he lives in exile. ``It's not over. ... The situation is
still critical.''
	   Algerian state radio said only that Matoub was ``cowardly
assassinated,'' without detailing the circumstances. A spokeswoman
for Triomphe records in Paris, which carries Matoub, said the
singer was killed as he drove out of the village.
	   Matoub was kidnapped Sept. 25, 1994 by the Armed Islamic Group,
the insurgency's most violent movement. He was freed two weeks
later with a letter from the group, demanding the Berbers support
the militants.
	   Meanwhile, security forces killed 18 Muslim militants and five
civilians were slain, according to reports Thursday. A bomb
exploded in an Algiers cafe Thursday morning, causing one slight
injury, French television station LCI reported.
	   The 18 militants were killed Wednesday by security forces near
the village of Sidi Lantri, 250 kms (150 miles) southwest of the
capital, said an official statement.
	   Authorities seized a large amount of arms and ammunition after
the clash, the statement said. As is customary in the insurgency,
officials gave no casualty figure among their own forces.
	   The slain militants were believed to have massacred 14 people
from two families that refused to give money, said villagers
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Four villagers were killed overnight Tuesday in Sidi Salerm,
near the mountain town of Medea about 100 kms (60 miles) south of
Algiers, the independent daily Liberte reported.
	   A member of a local government-backed ``self-defense'' militia
was shot and killed Wednesday in Sebdou, near the western town of
Tlemcen on the Moroccan border, the newspaper said.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government in the
former French colony scrapped second-round parliamentary elections
in January 1992.
	   The Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win the balloting on
voter discontent with corruption and high unemployment in this
petroleum-rich North African nation.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A military transport plane left Beirut
International Airport Thursday carrying the remains of an Israeli
soldier killed in southern Lebanon last year, back to Israel as
part of a swap with Lebanese guerrillas.
	   Just hours before the planned exchange of the remains for scores
of Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas, two Israeli soldiers were
killed by Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.
	   Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross and
the government of France, who helped broker the deal, were at the
heavily guarded Beirut airport when the remains of Sgt. Ist Class,
Itamar Ilya, were loaded onto the French C-160 military transport
aircraft. ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques Fresard, the man who
negotiated the deal, was on board, airport officials said.
	   Earlier in Beirut, officials from the Amal and Hezbollah
guerrilla groups, handed over body remains in their possession to
the Lebanese Army. In a statement, Hezbollah said it had handed
over the remains of Ilya and at least two other Israeli soldiers.
	   As several hundred people watched from balconies or gathered on
a street in south Beirut, Lebanese army medics transferred the
remains, placed in an icebox, from a Hezbollah ambulance to the
army ambulance outside a Hezbollah office.
	   The army ambulance then took off for Beirut airport, escorted by
other army vehicles.
	   A successful swap might give new impetus to efforts by Israel to
engage the Beirut government in negotiations on security
arrangements following an Israeli troop withdrawal from southern
Lebanon. The Lebanese government has refused to do so, saying U.N.
resolutions require Israel to leave without conditions.
	   The exchange was set in motion Wednesday when Israel began
digging up the bodies of 40 guerrillas killed in clashes in Israel,
including that of a son of Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah.
	   Ilya's remains were to arrive in Tel Aviv later Thursday. Israel
is to examine the body before returning the Hezbollah guerrillas'
remains to Beirut, possibly aboard the same plane.
	   A final phase of the swap was to take place Friday. Some 65
Hezbollah guerrillas were to be freed, about 15 from Israeli jails
and 50 from the Khiam lockup in south Lebanon run by an
Israeli-allied militia, the South Lebanon Army.

World Cup: Must-win for Colombia, draw's enough for England 
</HEADLINE>
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Colombia confronts a win or bust situation,
while England needs only a draw to reach the last 16 of the World
Cup, in their final Group G match on Friday night.
	   But it is England manager Glenn Hoddle rather than his opposite
number Hernan Dario Gomez who has the biggest headache in a story
of twists and turns.
	   Hoddle's hopes of England glory went soaring following an
opening 2-0 victory over Tunisia with goals from captain reliable
Alan Shearer and Paul Scholes. Gomez, in contrast, suffered
pre-tournament torture after sending home star striker Faustino
Asprilla for disciplinary reasons, a decision which became even
more difficult to defend when his team subsequently fell 1-0 to
Romania.
	   But all that changed Monday when England's bubble burst in a 2-1
loss to an attacking Romania and Colombia's confidence took off
with a 1-0 victory over Tunisia.
	   This left England and Colombia fighting for second-place behind
the Romanians, or the winner even qualifying as group leader in the
unlikely event of Romania losing big to Tunisia.
	   England's setback against Romania was damaging psychologically,
but more importantly an ankle injury threatens to sideline Paul
Ince, the bustling midfielder who says his favorite sound is the
crunch of a tackle.
	   Significantly, Romania did not get onto the scoreboard before
30-year-old Ince limped off with injured ankle ligaments, and he is
a key constituent in the backbone of the England team with his
defensive qualities and surging runs. David Beckham, who came on as
a substitute against Romania, is more effective in an attacking
role than Ince but lacks his biting tackling.
	   Colombia is back on solid footing after the loss to Romania and
the week-long crisis involving Asprilla. The Colombians' victory
against Tunisia came on a late goal by second-half substitute by
Leider Preciado.
	   While Colombia struggled to regain its form, England fell to
Romania after several glaring defensive lapses.
	   In his team's last practice, Gomez stressed speed and the aerial
attack, England's two main weapons.
	   Colombia will start 10 of the 11 regulars used against Tunisia.
Antonio Moreno will start for defender Jose Fernando Santa, who has
two yellow cards.
	   As for England, central defender Gary Neville is likely to keep
his role as stand-in for Gareth Southgate, who is still battling
against a knee injury.
	   Up front, Hoddle is under strong pressure to give a starting
role to 18-year-old Michael Owen as Alan Shearer's strike partner
instead of 31-year-old Teddy Sheringham.
	   Hoddle has been nursing the precocious talents of Owen, but now
seems ready to let the Liverpool teen-ager off the leash. Owen came
on as substitute for the last five minutes of England's opener
against Tunisia and then replaced Sheringham in the 77th minute
against Romania.
	   Owen responded by equalizing six minutes after coming on and
then followed up with a fierce drive in injury time which would
have earned England a draw if the ball had not hit the woodwork.
	   Hoddle has indicated Owen will be in the starting lineup Friday,
saying his build-up had been pre-planned.
	   ``I've always felt that it would be possible that Michael would
start against Colombia whatever happened. Even before we got to the
tournament, I felt that Colombia played very square at the back,
with a flat four, and against that sort of system is where
Michael's pace can be so useful for us. He's come on and scored
against Romania and so now if we start him his confidence is going
to be sky-high.''
	   Hoddle blamed sloppy defending for the loss against Romania and
remained confident of qualifying.
	   ``My belief hasn't changed, not at all. We gifted Romania two
goals, we've addressed that problem and the morale is right, we're
still very positive.
	   Colombia's attack will be directed by Carlos Valderrama, the
36-year-old veteran with the bushy dyed-blond fizzy hair.
	   ``Valderrama is still a key figure in our team. Every
opportunity of a goal that we get seems to be provided by him,''
Gomez said.
	   Valderrama says England's main asset is their strength and power
in the air. ``So we will not play the ball in the air, that's not
our style. We will make them run and we will make them tired. Then
we will go for victory.''

Two Israelis killed, four wounded in south Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES throughout with details of prisoner swap
By AHMED MANTASH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ In one of the biggest attacks this year,
Lebanese guerrillas detonated two bombs in an ambush Thursday,
killing two Israeli soldiers and wounding four in southern Lebanon.
	   The predawn attack near the border in the Israeli-occupied zone
came as Israel and Lebanon began a complex exchange of the remains
of an Israeli soldier for Lebanese prisoners and slain guerrillas.
The violence did not impede the deal.
	   Thursday's attack occurred near Houla, 1.6 kilometers (one mile)
from the Israeli border and about 50 kilometers (31 miles)
southeast of Sidon, provincial capital of southern Lebanon.
	   In retaliation for Thursday's attack, Israeli helicopters
strafed trails believed used by guerrillas with machine guns, and
other forces fired 15 mortars and about 40 shells, said Lebanese
security officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no word on casualties.
	   A statement by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah said its guerrillas
detonated the two bombs within 15 minutes of each other near an
Israeli patrol and then opened up with ``appropriate weapons'' as
reinforcements arrived at the scene.
	   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the Israeli patrol
hit ``explosive devices'' as it traveled to military exercises. He
said two troops were killed and three of the four wounded were in
serious condition.
	   Roadside bombs are the favorite weapon of guerrillas seeking to
dislodge 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied militiamen from
the occupied zone, which makes up 10 percent of Lebanese territory.
	   Thursday's fatalities raised to eight the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in southern Lebanon this year.
	   In phase two of the swap of prisoners and dead troops with
Lebanese guerrillas, Israel on Thursday awaited the return of the
body of an Israeli soldier killed in an ambush last year.
	   In Lebanon, officials from the Amal and Hezbollah guerrilla
groups handed parts of Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya in their
possession to the Lebanese Army.
	   In a statement, Hezbollah said it had handed over the remains of
Ilya and at least two other Israeli soldiers. It was impossible to
verify the claim.
	   As several hundred people watched from balconies and on a street
in south Beirut, Lebanese army medics transferred the remains, in
an icebox, from a Hezbollah ambulance to the army ambulance outside
a Hezbollah office. The army ambulance left for Beirut airport,
escorted by other army vehicles.
	   Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross and
the government of France, who helped broker the deal, were at the
heavily guarded Beirut airport when the remains of Sgt. Ist Class,
Itamar Ilya, were loaded onto the French C-160 military transport
aircraft.
	   ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques Fresard, the man who negotiated the
deal, was on board, airport officials said.
	   Israel is to examine the body before returning the Hezbollah
guerrillas' remains to Beirut aboard the same plane.
	   The exchange was set in motion Wednesday when Israel began
disinterring the bodies of 40 guerrillas killed in clashes in
Israel, including a son of Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah.
	   On Friday, some 65 Hezbollah guerrillas were to be freed: 15
from Israeli jails and 50 from the Khiam lockup in south Lebanon
run by an Israeli-allied militia, the South Lebanon Army.
	   In 1997, 39 Israeli soldiers were killed in guerrilla attacks, a
record annual figure since 1985 when Israel set up the occupied
zone to protect its northern towns from guerrilla attacks.

World Cup: Netherlands and Mexico qualify 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Mexico rallied from 2-0 down in the
final 15 minutes to tie the Netherlands 2-2 Thursday, qualifying
both teams for the second round of the World Cup.
	   Luis Hernandez fought off defender Jaap Stam to score the tying
goal in the fifth minute of injury time. The Mexicans also came
back from 2-0 down to tie Belgium 2-2 in their previous game.
	   The results placed the Dutch in first place in Group E, ahead of
Mexico on goal differential. Belgium, which needed a victory to
stay alive, finished third after a 1-1 draw with South Korea.
	   Phillip Cocu and Ronald de Boer had the goals for the
Netherlands, which dominated the game until Ricardo Pelaez scored
for Mexico in the 75th minute.
	   Cuauhtemoc Blanco also netted in the 89th, but was whistled for
offsides. Ramon Ramirez was given a red card for protesting the
call and will miss Mexico's second round match Monday.
	   Cocu opened the scoring exactly four minutes into the game when
he outraced the defense to chase down Dennis Bergkamp's long pass
to drive a left-footed shot past goalkeeper Jorge Campos. Cocu
celebrated with a head-first dive on the soaked turf on a cool,
rainy day at Stade Geoffroy Guichard.
	   De Boer followed with one of the best individual efforts of the
tournament. He shook off three challenges before sending the ball
between the legs of defender Joel Sanchez and off the left post,
catching Campos moving in the wrong direction.
	   Campos made a nice save on Bergkamp in the 30th minute, but he
didn't have a chance against Marc Overmars' chip shot that drifted
tantalizingly wide of the post in the 40th. Bergkamp also hit the
crossbar in the 50th minute.
	   Mexico, ragged and ineffective for much of the game, finally got
on the board on a chaotic corner kick. German Villa headed the
corner to substitute Pelaez, whose shot bounced untouched through a
scrum of two Dutch players and one Mexican and into the net.
	   Until the final minutes, the most dramatic Mexican performance
came from a fan climbed onto the beams on the underside of the roof
covering the stands. The man then shimmied more than 30 meters down
a huge pole to the wild cheers of fellow Mexican supporters. He was
escorted away by stewards.

Gingrich to support trade extension for China 
</HEADLINE>
RETRANSMITS to correct category code
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ As U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in
China, a major critic of his China policy was speaking out at home
in favor of extending normal trade relations with the Chinese
government.
	   House Speaker Newt Gingrich called a news conference to outline
his position on ``most-favored-nation'' trade status for China and
other trade issues, including giving the president authority to
negotiate free-trade agreements with Latin American countries.
	   Gingrich and other Republican leaders, including Majority Leader
Dick Armey, have supported keeping normal trade relations with
China in the past. But they have said extending the status will be
more difficult this year because of rising anger over China's
human-rights and weapons proliferation policies.
	   Congress must vote this summer whether to disapprove Clinton's
decision to extend most-favored-nation status for another year.
	   Gingrich also was to address the issues of how Republican
leaders intend to restart stalled debate on providing the
International Monetary Fund $3.5 billion for emergency uses and
helping U.S. agricultural exports hit by sanctions against India
and Pakistan.

World Cup: Belgium eliminated after 1-1 tie with South Korea Associated Press Wirter 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT
By RAF CASERT
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Yoo Sang-chul stretched to knock in a free kick
from Ha Seok-ju in the 71st minute, rallying South Korea to a 1-1
draw with Belgium that turned out to be meaningless for both teams.
	   The result had no impact on either side's chances for
advancement due to Mexico's 2-2 draw with the Netherlands in
Saint-Etienne. Belgium needed a victory over South Korea, which
already had been eliminated, and for the Dutch to beat Mexico to
advance into the second round. The Dutch only needed a draw to
advance from Group E.
	   Belgium looked to be in good shape early, taking a lead shortly
after kickoff, while the Dutch led Mexico 2-0 in the second half.
	   A header from Gordan Vidovic was pushed off the line in the
seventh minute by a South Korean defender, but Luc Nilis surged
into the area to volley in the much-needed opener past diving
goalkeeper Kim Byung-ji.
	   But Belgium's hopes were deflated with 19 minutes remaining,
when Ha lofted a free kick for from the left and Yoo stretched to
touch the ball with his right foot, beating several diving Belgian
defenders on the far side of the goal box.
	   Although already eliminated from the tournament, the South
Koreans appeared determined to win their first match in five World
Cup appearances _ their last opportunity before co-hosting the next
World Cup with Japan in 2002.
	   South Korean coach Kim Pyung-Soek _ promoted after Cha Bum-kin
was fired following the team's dismal 5-0 loss to the Netherlands _
made few changes to Cha's starting lineup against the Dutch.
	   They demonstrated tight defending and an ability to shoot from
distance, but also bouts of tactical naivete that the experienced
Belgians _ fielding a team whose average age was over 30 _ were
quick to take advantage of.
	   In the 22nd minute, forward Seo Jung-won ran down a long pass,
but although completely unmarked, fumbled the shot from some 12
meters, the ball bouncing off his shin and shooting past the post.
	   In the 51st minute, Nilis hit the crossbar from six meters after
chesting a cross in the box and swivelling around defenders Ha and
Lee Sang-hun.
	   After the equalizer, the two teams had at least half-a-dozen
opportunities to take the lead, but the score remained unchanged.
	   Brazilian referee Rezende de Freitas handed out yellow cards to

	   LENS, France (AP) _ The fear of new World Cup violence was
tangible on the streets of this small northern French town
Thursday, with bars closing, and schoolchildren staying home.
	   Lens, a town of about 30,000 people, was hit by the World Cup's
worst violence last Sunday when German fans rampaged. A French
policeman hit over the head by an iron bar was left in a coma.
	   On Friday, the town plays host to a match between England and
Colombia.
	   Fear of English soccer hooligans is running high. In addition,
many people dread a return of the Germans, who, according to
reports, might seek a confrontation Friday with the English.
	   At the Carnot primary school, teacher Evelyne Tumerelle said
only three of her pupils would come to school on Friday, instead of
the usual number of 20.
	   ``You can understand their parents' fears,'' Tumerelle said.
Lens authorities said each school would decide whether to advise
parents to keep their children at home.
	   At a cafe on the central Boulevard Basly, owner Edith Fourneau
said many of her clients would not venture out until the fans were
out of town. She too plans to close for the weekend.
	   ``Having the Spanish in town Wednesday night was very good, but
the fear of British hooligans just won't go away,'' she said.
	   On Thursday, no incidents were reported, and a bolstered police
force was monitoring English fans. Lens police said there was no
sign of German fans arriving.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
has announced alcohol restrictions. Officials banned its sale or
possession on the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   But Lens mayor Andre Delelis said he regretted the ban had not
been extended to surrounding towns, especially supermarkets.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As many as 10,000
ticketless English fans were expected.
	   Authorities have stepped up security around Friday's game, as
well as Thursday night's Germany-Iran clash in Montpellier,
southern France.
	   Germany's Interior Ministry toughened border checks, with 1,000
border guards deployed. By noon Thursday, more than 10,000
travelers had been checked. Fourteen suspected hooligans had their
passports seized.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   Violence has shaken the five-week soccer championship, with
clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100 injured.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have arrested more than 250 people and deported a number of English
and German hooligans.
	   French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said Thursday
that the German hooligans responsible for Sunday's mayhem were
``ultra violent neo-Nazi and neo-fascist thugs.''
	   He said they ``should be held up to public shame.''
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths after clashes with English fans in Marseille
two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen local youths carrying
baseball bats.
	   An English fan, 38-year-old Steven James Clarke, of Stourbridge,
West Midlands, was stabbed. Doctors say he will probably be
released from intensive care on Friday.

Hingis struggles but reaches third round AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Tops with Hingis victory
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Swiping the grass with her racket in
frustration, Martina Hingis hardly looked like the defending
Wimbledon champion and top seed as she struggled Thursday to
overcome a little-known opponent.
	   Hingis faced a surprisingly tough challenge from Elena Makarova,
a Russian ranked 79th in the world, before prevailing 7-6 (7-2),
6-4 to reach the third round on another rain-affected day.
	   ``I made it tough on myself,'' Hingis said. ``It wasn't an
outstanding performance, I must say. Maybe tomorrow's a better
day.''
	   Lisa Raymond, who lost to Hingis in a tight, first-round match,
had said the Swiss teen-ager was ``vulnerable'' to an upset. That
seemed true Wednesday as Hingis got into trouble against a player
who had won only four matches all year.
	   When the match started after a half-hour rain delay, Hingis made
uncharacteristic unforced errors and seemed to rush her shots.
	   ``I was a little bit surprised by the way she played,'' Hingis
said. ``She served very well, played very fast. I tried to force it
more and more and made more and more mistakes.''
	   Makharova was poised to win the first set when she broke for a
5-4 lead. But the Russian double faulted to lose serve, then Hingis
held at love in the next game and dominated the tiebreaker.
	   Play was stopped by showers at the start of the second set. When
the match resumed 30 minutes later, Hingis raced out to a 4-1 lead.
But she faltered again as Makarova won three straight games to tie
the set at 4-4.
	   When Makarova broke in the eighth game, Hingis slammed the grass
with her racket and grimaced in anger. Hingis broke back in the
next game and then served out the match, closing with a backhand
winner.
	   Hingis, who at 16 years and nine months became the youngest
woman in 110 years to win Wimbledon last year, said it will be
tougher to repeat.
	   ``Last year I didn't really expect myself doing so well,'' she
said. ``Now, because I know I can play on grass, there's probably a
little more pressure on myself. I want to do really well and
sometimes it doesn't work that well.''
	   In other early matches, No. 3 Jana Novotna was playing Tatiana
Panova, and Jennifer Capriati faced fellow American wild card Lori
McNeil.
	   Wimbledon has lost six of the 16 men's seeds in the first three
days _ and now Andre Agassi is in danger of going out, too.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13 seed, was trailing two sets
to one against Germany's Tommy Haas when the second-round match was
suspended by darkness Wednesday night.
	   The American was furious over a crucial line call that helped
Haas win the third set.
	   A forehand by Haas was ruled good, even though replays showed it
was clearly out.
	   Agassi stabbed the spot where he saw the ball land, then
approached chair umpire John Frame.
	   ``It was nearly six inches (out),'' he protested. ``It was out
both ways. It was wide and it was long.''
	   Frame shook his head and the call stood, giving Haas a 6-3 lead
in the tiebreaker. Agassi saved one set point, but succumbed on the
next to fall behind 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Play was then suspended, and Agassi resumed his protest.
	   ``In 12 years, I've never seen it miss that much,'' he said to
Frame.
	   The Centre Court crowd jeered the umpire and linesmen as they
left the court.
	   With the match scheduled to resume Thursday, Agassi will have a
lot of work to do to reach the third round.
	   In a sign of how wide open the men's field is, four seeds went
out Wednesday _ No. 2 Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg Rusedski, No. 8
Cedric Pioline and No. 15 Karol Kucera. No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov
and No. 10 Alex Corretja had been ousted earlier.
	   Rios proved what many people thought: he didn't deserve to be
seeded No. 2 behind Pete Sampras. The moody Chilean's distaste for
grass was apparent as he lost in five sets to Spain's Francisco
Clavet.
	   Rios griped about the line calls, the tournament organization
and especially the surface.
	   ``Grass is not a surface to watch tennis or to play tennis,'' he
said. ``It's really boring.''
	   Rios' priority was to catch the first flight out.
	   ``I'm trying to leave tonight, or tomorrow,'' he said. ``But
I've got to go.''

Yeltsin to visit Argentina, praises President Carlos Menem 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian President Boris Yeltsin will visit
Argentina in 1999, his spokesman said Thursday after two days of
talks with President Carlos Menem.
	   ``I like Argentina's president,'' Yeltsin said, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``I did business with him with pleasure
without any problems, and I am ready to continue doing so.''
	   Officials from Russia and Argentina signed several agreements
Thursday on bilateral relations, air traffic, cooperation between
their interior ministries and a program of cultural and educational
exchanges for 1998 and 1999.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC said Thursday it will drastically
slash oil output, hoping to undo the damage it did to prices by an
ill-judged decision to start pumping more crude last winter.
	   World oil supplies are now so glutted that OPEC acknowledged its
plan to withdraw some 1.355 million barrels a day from the market
is not likely to have an immediate impact.
	   But the initial reaction on futures markets was negative, with
modest early losses on the London market worsening after New York
traders went to work.
	   Brent crude oil to be delivered in August was off by 41 cents at
13.20 per barrel by late Thursday afternoon on London's
International Petroleum Exchange. Light sweet crude oil for August
was down 58 cents at dlrs 14.02 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.

EDS: UPDATES with Balbo possibly starting at forward with Batistuta
By TONY CZUCZKA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VITTEL, France (AP) _ Argentina and newcomer Croatia, both
already assured of a place in the second round, battle each other
in Bordeaux on Friday for the top qualifying spot in their World
Cup group.
	   Croatia's aging defense is forewarned after Argentine star
striker Gabriel Batistuta tallied three times in a 5-0 rout of
Jamaica last weekend and vaulted to the top of the scorers' list
with four goals.
	   On the other end, Croatian top scorer Davor Suker will need to
improve his marksmanship after wasting several chances against
Japan before knocking in the late 1-0 that lifted Croatia into the
next round.
	   Batistuta, the tournament's scoring co-leader with four goals,
could see his old friend Abel Balbo in Argentina's front line.
	   Balbo, in his third straight World Cup, could replace Claudio
Lopez, who's had two lackluster performances against Japan and
Jamaica.
	   This would be the first time that Balbo and Batistuta would be
paired in Argentina's front line for a World Cup match.
	   Batistuta has eight goals in two World Cups, Balbo has none in
three world championships. Ariel Ortega is expected to make another
start as playmaker.
	   Croatia will be heartened by the return of team captain and
playmaker Zvonimir Boban, who sat out the Japan game with a pulled
leg muscle.
	   Croatian coach Miroslav Blazevic has promised to field his
strongest team. He is intent on upsetting Argentina, a two-time
world champion, to wipe out bad memories from a similar situation
in the 1996 European Championship in England.
	   There, Blazevic deliberately sent on a weak team that lost the
last group game against Portugal, pitting Croatia against Germany,
his preferred opponent, in the quarterfinals.
	   Portugal won the group and faced the Czech Republic.
	   The Croatians then lost 2-1 to Germany, the eventual champion,
and Blazevic nearly lost his job.
	   Blazevic pumped himself up on the eve of Friday's game.
	   ``I won't pull any such trick this time. We don't have any false
respect for Argentina,'' he said. ``My team is the best.''
	   Argentina last won the World Cup in 1986 with Diego Maradona and
are considered contenders this year.
	   After routing Jamaica and defeating Japan 1-0, the South
Americans need only a draw to finish atop the group and set up a
second-round game with the Group G runner-up _ most likely England
or Colombia. Croatia, which beat Jamaica only 3-1, can expect to
face Romania unless it wins on Friday.
	   Passarella is expected to replace AC Parma's Roberto Sensini,
who has a pulled leg muscle, with Nelson Vivas. Word from the
Argentinian camp is that the coach also may rest left back Jose
Chamot because he already has been cautioned once.
	   Croatia's only absentee is veteran defender Igor Stimac,
suffering from blistered feet. Silvio Maric will take his spot.
	   Croatia and Argentina are meeting for the first time, but one
Croatian player already has faced the South Americans in the World
Cup: midfielder Robert Prosinecki played in the 1990 Yugoslav squad
that was eliminated by Argentina in the quarterfinals after a
penalty shootout.

Last-minute negotiating fails to get Chinese opera to U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Hours after a U.S. music festival
canceled a 22-hour Chinese opera because censors impounded its
sets, officials offered Thursday to release them.
	   But the censors then added a new twist by refusing to allow the
cast to leave Shanghai. The head of the festival said the decision
meant the show could not go on.
	   Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival '98,
received the offer in a bizarre, heated meeting with Chinese
officials held at the Shanghai airport just minutes before Redden
was to board a flight out of China.
	   Redden flew to Shanghai this week to negotiate after the
Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company was barred from going to New York City
to perform the ``Peony Pavilion.'' Officials criticized the opera,
a love story written in 1598, as ``feudal, superstitious and
pornographic.''
	   Lincoln Center on Wednesday canceled the opera, which was
scheduled to open the festival on July 7. Spread over six evenings,
the dlrs 500,000 production involves 21 people singing 150 roles.
	   The dispute, just days before U.S. President Bill Clinton's
scheduled visit to Shanghai, seems inexplicable in an era when
Chinese leaders are vigorously promoting classical culture.
	   Ma Bomin, director of the Shanghai Cultural Bureau, which
impounded the opera sets and barred the singers from traveling,
indicated that her office doesn't have a specific complaint.
	   ``We haven't settled on the problem yet,'' she said.
	   The bureau, stung by public criticism, took the highly unusual
step of inviting American reporters to a meeting between Redden and
Ma in an airport lounge. It wasn't clear whether the Chinese
officials were hoping for a face-saving compromise or wanted to
appear conciliatory.
	   Redden, who said inviting reporters was a ``dirty trick,''
angrily complained that despite three days of talks, Chinese
officials had failed to explain their complaints or respond to
offers to modify the opera.
	   ``All of my flexibility was met on the part of the municipal
Cultural Bureau by no cooperation or flexibility,'' said Redden. He
has said Chinese authorities signed a contract a year ago approving
the production.
	   Ma said the bureau wanted time to review the opera. But she
wouldn't say how long a delay was required _ a condition that
Lincoln Center had said would force a cancellation.
	   After Redden had left the meeting to collect his boarding pass,
Ma told the reporters that some of the sets could be sent to New
York immediately. But she said the singers had to stay in Shanghai
until the opera was changed to the Cultural Bureau's satisfaction.
	   When Redden returned and a reporter told him of the exchange, he
said that meant the Cultural Bureau had canceled the performance.
But when told that Ma also had said she wanted to talk more, he
said, ``Then I will not go on this flight. We'll talk further,''
and dramatically tore his boarding pass into pieces.
	   However, he insisted on meeting away from the reporters.
	   ``I think that it's a dirty trick to invite the press to a
private meeting,'' he said.
	   Redden and Ma then walked away to talk. But after a 10-minute
exchange through an interpreter, Redden turned to the reporters,
gave a thumbs-down gesture and headed for his airplane.

Francois Lehideux, last wartime Vichy minister, dead at 95 
</HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) - Francois Lehideux, a former minister in the
pro-Nazi Vichy regime who tirelessly defended its anti-Jewish
measures during World War II has died. He was 95.
	   Lehideux, the last surviving Vichy minister, died on June 21,
the Le Monde daily reported Thursday. No cause of death was given.
	   For years after the war, Lehideux was among France's most ardent
supporters of Marshall Philippe Petain, the hero of Verdun who led
France's collaborationist regime during World War II.
	   The son of a banker, Lehideux became one of France's best and
brightest civil servants who put their talents to work for the
Nazis.
	   He headed France's automobile commission in the early 1940s, and
as minister of industrial production until 1942, he established
collaborative links between top French companies and Nazi Germany.
	   Lehideux was married to the niece of the founder of automobile
company Renault.
	   In 1940, he agreed that Renault would furnish spare parts to the
German army, repair tanks and provide any technical assistance
necessary to their war effort.
	   Le Monde writer Nicolas Weil described Lehideux as a ``young
idealist who dreamed of modernizing and industrializing France for
its place in a German Europe.''
	   He was arrested and jailed after the liberation, but was freed
in 1946. Charges of collaborating with the enemy were dropped in
1949. He went on to head Ford France until 1953.
	   Lehideux never regretted his wartime collaboration. In
interviews given on the eve of the crimes against humanity trial of
Maurice Papon, a former budget minister, he said there were
``extenuating circumstances'' to justify Vichy's systematic looting
of Jewish assets.
	   No details on survivors or funeral arrangements were immediately
available.

Garzelli scores first major win in taking Tour de Suisse 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Stefano Garzelli won his first major
event Thursday, capturing the 62nd annual Tour de Suisse with a
14th place finish in the 10th and final stage.
	   ``It was a very tough day,'' said the 25-year-old Italian, who
finished 53 seconds ahead of Beat Zberg of Switzerland in the
overall standings.
	   ``In the beginning I was afraid I might lose,'' Garzelli said.
``I thought, `If these attacks continue, this is going to be
difficult.'''
	   Niki Aebersold of Switzerland won the 10th stage, a
193-kilometer (119.9 miles) loop through central Switzerland,
starting and ending in the capital Bern. His time was 4 hours 24
minutes 57 seconds.
	   Aebersold, who also won the eighth stage, led a group of five in
a sprint across the finish line, ahead of Vladimir Duma of Ukraine
and Olympic gold medalist Pascal Richard of Switzerland. Garzelli
was 16 seconds behind.
	   Jan Ullrich of Germany, last year's Tour de France winner,
finished 10th overall. Bjarne Riis of Denmark, winner of the 1996
Tour de France, was 11th.
	   Garzelli's dominance in the gruelling alpine stages last weekend
propelled him to the top of the standings. His victory in the fifth
stage last Saturday was his first professional win.
	   He followed by taking the next stage and capturing the leader's
golden tricot, which he then never relinquished.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A very weak low-level trough embedded in the trade winds has
moved west across the Virgin Islands early this morning and will
cross Puerto Rico this morning, with high pressure across the
east-central Atlantic building into the eastern Caribbean behind
it.
	   This will freshen winds across the Caribbean coastal waters
today, producing very choppy seas offshore.
	   This high pressure will also bring modest amounts of low-level
moisture into the area as well; sufficient to allow for widely
scattered to scattered afternoon showers across the region.
	   A mild and narrow upper-level trough extending from the central
Caribbean northeast across Puerto Rico this morning will drift west
this afternoon, creating moderately unstable atmospheric
conditions.
	   Scattered afternoon showers developing across interior and
western Puerto Rico are expected to intensify, yielding isolated
thunderstorms capable of brief, very heavy rain.
	   These unstable conditions and ample moisture are forecast to
persist across the local area again on Friday for similar weather
conditions.
	   The next tropical wave for our region is expected to pass south
of the local area on Saturday and may increase showers across our
Caribbean waters.
	   The national hurricane center continues to monitor a large area
of disturbed weather across the western Caribbean and the Gulf of
Mexico. This area offers some potential for tropical development
through the weekend.

World Cup: Netherlands and Mexico qualify 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS more detail, quotes; CLARIFIES how first Mexican goal was
scored, 12th graf; optional upcoming
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Mexico rallied from 2-0 down in the
final 15 minutes to tie the Netherlands 2-2 Thursday, qualifying
both teams for the second round of the World Cup.
	   Luis Hernandez fought off defender Jaap Stam and poked the ball
under goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar to score the tying goal in the
fifth minute of injury time, the last in a frantic series of
assaults on the Dutch goal. The Mexicans also came back from 2-0
down to tie Belgium 2-2 in their previous game.
	   ``I am happy. It was an unbelievable game,'' Hernandez said.
``It was a fantastic game for us. A triumph for Mexico and the
Mexican people.''
	   The result placed the Dutch in first place in Group E, ahead of
Mexico on goal differential. Belgium, which needed a victory to
stay alive, finished third after a 1-1 draw with South Korea.
	   Phillip Cocu and Ronald de Boer had the goals for the Dutch, who
relaxed late after dominating most of the game.
	   ``I think they earned the draw,'' Cocu said. ``You can only
compliment Mexico.''
	   Ricardo Pelaez scored for Mexico in the 75th minute. Cuauhtemoc
Blanco also netted in the 89th, but was whistled for offsides.
Ramon Ramirez was given a red card for protesting the call and will
miss Mexico's second round match Monday.
	   The cool, wet conditions were ideally-suited to the fast,
fluent, attacking tactics of the Dutch, and they got the early goal
in the fifth minute when Cocu ran on to a neat flicked pass by
Dennis Bergkamp and fired a low, hard shot past the dive of
goalkeeper Jorge Campos.
	   It was Cocu's second goal in two matches since being promoted
from a defensive midfielder's role to the forward line in a
surprise switch forced on Dutch coach Guus Hiddink by the two-game
suspension of Patrick Kluivert.
	   De Boer followed with one of the best individual efforts of the
tournament. He shook off three challenges before sending the ball
between the legs of defender Joel Sanchez and off the left post,
catching Campos moving in the wrong direction.
	   Campos made a nice save on Bergkamp in the 30th minute, but he
didn't have a chance against Marc Overmars' chip shot that drifted
tantalizingly wide of the post in the 40th. Cocu also hit the
crossbar in the 50th minute.
	   Mexico, ragged and ineffective for much of the game, finally got
on the board when Pelaez rose above the Dutch defense to head home
German Villa's corner kick. The ball bounced untouched through a
scrum of two Dutch players and one Mexican and into the net.
	   Until the final minutes, the most dramatic Mexican performance
came from a fan climbed onto the beams on the underside of the roof
covering the stands. The man then shimmied more than 30 meters down
a huge pole to the wild cheers of fellow Mexican supporters. He was
escorted away by stewards.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ As police detained three dissidents in Xi'an,
where President Bill Clinton began his China visit on Thursday,
three others in the coastal city of Hangzhou took the bold move of
announcing the formation of a democratic opposition party.
	   The Chinese Democratic Party announced it was founded on the
principles of direct elections and division of government power,
and promised to eradicate corruption.
	   Wang Youcai, who along with Wang Donghai and Lin Hui tried to
register the party on Thursday at the Civil Affairs bureau, but
were told the person in charge of registration was not in.
	   ``We must take development step by step,'' said Wang Youcai, a
former Beijing University student who was expelled after he helped
lead the 1989 student protests. The party is still in the
preparatory stage with no other members, he said.
	   After the military quashed the protest movement, Wang was placed
on the government's list of 21 most-wanted student organizers and
spent three years in prison.
	   A declaration by the party invited all Chinese democracy
activists to join.
	   China's Communist Party has allowed no genuine opposition
parties to challenge its complete control over the government.
	   Clinton arrived in Xi'an Thursday evening, beginning the first
visit to China by a U.S. president since the Tiananmen crackdown.
He is scheduled to go to Beijing on Friday for weekend talks with
President Jiang Zemin.
	   Police in Xi'an detained Yang Hai on Thursday at the company
where he works as a salesman after a crew from an American
broadcast news company, ABC, arrived to interview him, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported.
	   Yang, who served a year in prison after the 1989 movement, has
signed various petitions for reform this year, the center said.
	   Yan Jun, a dissident in Xi'an who took part in a letter signed
by 70 people asking Clinton to meet dissidents, was taken away from
his home Wednesday afternoon, the group said.
	   It said police also detained Li Zhiying, a county official in
Chengcheng, about 125 kilometers (80 miles) northeast of Xi'an, who
was in frequent contact with other Xi'an dissidents and had
previously signed petitions to the government.
	   Letters and petitions are among the few recourses for Chinese
who take issue with government policy. Even former Communist Party
leader Zhao Ziyang, under house arrest since the June 3-4, 1989,
crackdown on democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square, has
resorted to penning his grievances.
	   The Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported Wednesday that
Zhao wrote a letter to party leaders urging them to use the
occasion of Clinton's visit to reconsider their condemnation of the
protests as ``counterrevolutionary turmoil.''
	   ``The shadow of the June 4 Tiananmen incident should be cast
off. We should face the new century under the light of democracy,''
the newspaper quoted Zhao's letter as saying.
	   One Chinese source with contacts to Zhao's family said he
believed the letter was written with Zhao's knowledge, if not by
Zhao himself. Zhao is not allowed contact with the media, and
former associates of his reached by phone said that while they had
not seen any letter, it was not out of character for Zhao.
	   ``I certainly believe it represents Zhao's point of view,'' said
former aide Bao Tong, who spent seven years in prison for his
association with the liberal leader. ``The whole world can
understand his point of view,'' Bao said.
	   Wang Bingzhang, who sneaked into China to try to organize the
underground Chinese Democracy and Justice Party, said he supported
the Hangzhou dissidents' efforts to start their own democratic
party.
	   He said in a telephone interview he hoped Clinton would speak
about freedom of association when he meets with Jiang.
	   Wang, who was caught and deported from China, added: ``We hope
the Beijing government could tolerate a Chinese democratic party
and allow us to return to China.''
	   In Beijing, longtime activist Xu Wenli said police on a
motorbike and in a car followed him Thursday when he took his wife
out for a homecoming dinner following her two-month trip to the
United States to visit their daughter.
	   Four of his friends who tried to visit him on Tuesday were
detained, but were released after questioning, he said.

World Cup: Belgium eliminated after 1-1 tie with South Korea Associated Press Wirter 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with comments
By RAF CASERT
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Yoo Sang-chul stretched to knock in a free kick
from Ha Seok-ju in the 71st minute, rallying South Korea to a 1-1
draw with Belgium that turned out to be meaningless for both teams.
	   The result had no impact on either side's chances for
advancement due to Mexico's 2-2 draw with the Netherlands in
Saint-Etienne. Belgium needed a victory over South Korea, which
already had been eliminated, and for the Dutch to beat Mexico to
advance into the second round. The Dutch only needed a draw to
advance from Group E.
	   Belgium looked to be in good shape early, taking a lead shortly
after kickoff, while the Dutch led Mexico 2-0 in the second half.
	   A header from Gordan Vidovic was pushed off the line in the
seventh minute by a South Korean defender, but Luc Nilis surged
into the area to volley in the much-needed opener past diving
goalkeeper Kim Byung-ji.
	   But Belgium's hopes were deflated with 19 minutes remaining,
when Ha lofted a free kick for from the left and Yoo stretched to
touch the ball with his right foot, beating several diving Belgian
defenders on the far side of the goal box.
	   It was Belgium's third draw in the first round. ``You have to be
able to win at least one game to advance and we could not,'' said
Belgian captain Franky Van der Elst.
	   ``After a good start we fell back too quickly,'' said Van der
Elst, who will retire from international soccer after playing in
four World Cups.
	   Although already eliminated from the tournament, the South
Koreans appeared determined to win their first match in five World
Cup appearances _ their last opportunity before co-hosting the next
World Cup with Japan in 2002.
	   South Korean coach Kim Pyung-Soek _ promoted after Cha Bum-kin
was fired following the team's dismal 5-0 loss to the Netherlands _
made few changes to Cha's starting lineup against the Dutch.
	   His players demonstrated tight defending and an ability to shoot
from distance, but also bouts of tactical naivete that the
experienced Belgians _ fielding a team whose average age was over
30 _ were quick to take advantage of.
	   ``We wanted to give our fans a boost after two demoralizing
losses,'' said coach Kim Pyung-seok.
	   In the 22nd minute, forward Seo Jung-won ran down a long pass,
but although completely unmarked, fumbled the shot from some 12
meters, the ball bouncing off his shin and shooting past the post.
	   In the 51st minute, Nilis hit the crossbar from six meters after
chesting a cross in the box and swivelling around defenders Ha and
Lee Sang-hun.
	   After the equalizer, the two teams had at least half-a-dozen
opportunities to take the lead, but the score remained unchanged.
	   Brazilian referee Rezende de Freitas handed out yellow cards to
Vital Borkelmans, Lee Lim-saeng, Lee Min-sung, and keeper Kim
Byung-ji.

Kosovo Albanian leader cites ``ethnic cleansing'' in his province 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Rugova meeting Kohl
By IAN MADER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Kosovo-Albanian political leader Ibrahim
Rugova reiterated demands for independence Thursday, despite urging
by NATO officials that he abandon the push and resume peace talks
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Rugova, after meeting in Bonn with Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel, said the ``climate'' was not right for talks.
	   He also intensified his appeal for NATO intervention in his
secessionist home province, saying that Serb-led forces were
driving out tens of thousands of his ethnic brethren.
	   He recalled the ``ethnic cleansing'' of the war in Bosnia in his
accounts of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian-majority province in the
Serb Republic, which makes up most of Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova said that about 80,000 ethnic Albanians have been driven
from their homes by fighting between Serb forces and the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army. About 15,000 people have fled to
neighboring Albania. More than 300 people have been killed.
	   ``We see ethnic cleansing taking place already in Kosovo,'' said
Rugova.
	   The Albanian leader met briefly later Thursday with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, and then headed back to Kosovo for talks Friday with
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, who helped broker the Bosnian peace
accord.
	   Kinkel said he made clear to Rugova that Germany and most
Western powers oppose independence for Kosovo but want to see its
autonomy restored. Milosevic stripped Kosovo of its broad autonomy
in 1989 and introduced virtual martial law.
	   Kinkel urged Western powers to increase pressure on Milosevic to
withdraw forces from Kosovo and to make clear that NATO is
considering military intervention. He also called on militant
Albanians to follow the pacifist Rugova in renouncing violence.
	   Kohl said in a statement that the international pressure on
Milosevic can be ``credible'' only when the entire Kosovo Albanian
leadership calls on militants to stop their fighting.
	   Kinkel said NATO should try to secure Russia's support for any
intervention in Kosovo, as it did for its U.N.-mandated
intervention in Bosnia. So far, Russia has opposed Western military
pressure on Yugoslavia, its longtime ally.
	   ``Why can't NATO and Russia go together, as they did in
Bosnia?'' Kinkel asked. ``We don't want to attack anyone. We just
want to restore order on the ground.''
	   Defense Minister Volker Ruehe told ARD television Thursday that
NATO would rely on air power to end the violence and expulsions in
Kosovo. Ground troops would be used only to enforce a peace
agreement, as was done in Bosnia, he said.
	   NATO has said it is keeping all options open, including sending
ground troops for military action. But a NATO official in Brussels,
speaking on condition of anonymity, suggested Thursday that ground
troops would be a last, and unlikely, resort.
	   ``Sending ground troops _ whether for military action or even
peacekeeping operations _ is an option that sits on the highest
rung of the ladder,'' the official said.

Puerto Rican strikers plant bombs, smash machines, cut telephone cables 
</HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE FAUL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Protesters planted bombs, smashed
automated bank machines and severed and burned telephone and
electric cables, reacting with fury Thursday to the privatization
of Puerto Rico's telephone company.
	   One homemade bomb exploded Thursday in the hands of a policeman
as he removed it from a bank in the southern coastal town of Santa
Isabel. He was hospitalized with injuries to his hands and legs,
police reported.
	   The bomb, in a flashlight, was planted at a branch of Banco
Popular, part of a consortium buying the Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   The rash of sabotage started hours after Gov. Pedro Rossello on
Wednesday signed a law finalizing the dlrs 1.9 billion sale of the
company, commonly called Telefonica, to a consortium led by the
U.S. communications giant GTE Corp.
	   Fearing they will lose their jobs, Telefonica's 6,400 workers
began an indefinite strike eight days ago and began cutting
telephone cables. By Wednesday, telephone service had been cut to
345,000 of the 1.3 million customers and half the island's 750
automatic bank machines.
	   Dozens more fiber optic cables were cut overnight all over the
island, 48 in the second city of Ponce alone, police reported. In
the central mountain town of Cayey, arsonists set ablaze a
telephone switching box. Protesters burned out a telephone booth in
western Mayaguez.
	   Violent clashes with riot police have won the protesters some
sympathy and other unions have joined the strike.
	   On Thursday, the Labor Union of Nurses and Health Employees
urged its thousands of members to stop work.
	   About 6,000 of the 10,000 electricity workers and several
thousand at the water utility started a 72-hour strike Tuesday that
did not immediately affect services. Overnight, however, police
reported that saboteurs cut and burned a 15,000-volt electric cable
in Rio Piedras, a southern suburb of San Juan with hundreds of
high-rise apartments and several shopping centers.
	   Also in Rio Piedras, protesters at dawn threw a firebomb at an
electric pylon but did not cause major damage, the police said.
	   The effects of the sabotage were not immediately known.
	   Protesters wielding blunt weapons smashed four Banco Popular
automated bank machines in Bayamon suburb, police reported.
	   Unions in Puerto Rico have a history of violent strikes marked
by sabotage. In the worst instance, the Teamsters union set a fire
at the DuPont Plaza hotel on New Year's Eve 1986, killing 97 people
and injuring 140.

Poland will introduce visas for eastern visitors at EU request 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland will introduce visas for its
eastern neighbors if the European Union demands that, the deputy
interior minister said Thursday.
	   It is too early to set a date for introducing visas but the
Polish government will do everything necessary for Poland to be
accepted into the EU, Wojciech Brochwicz told journalists upon his
return from an EU conference on borders in Ostend, Belgium.
	   Poland will be tasked with protecting the EU's longest outer
border after it enters the EU - more than 2,000 kilometers (1240
miles) including the sea border, said Brochwich.
	   Poland restricted the entry for Russians and Belorussians in
December to address concern from its western neighbors that it was
becoming a transit point for illegal immigrants and organized crime
from the east.
	   The new requirements raised complaints on both sides of the
border as they restricted lucrative border trade.
	   Border traffic with Ukraine has not changed because both
countries signed an agreement on visa-free movement and a
readmission agreement providing for returning illegal immigrants.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to negotiate an end to fighting in Kosovo Thursday, meeting with
Slobodan Milosevic a day after demanding the Yugoslav president's
forces leave the province.
	   Aiming to head off NATO intervention in Kosovo, Holbrooke sat
down with Milosevic in the presidential palace for several hours
for the second time in three days. Neither side commented
afterward.
	   Holbrooke also was to meet with a Russian envoy before heading
to Kosovo on Friday for talks with Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic
Albanian leader, in the separatist province's capital of Pristina.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting this year between
Serb-led security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
attracted increasing support in the predominantly Albanian province
of Serbia.
	   Holbrooke, who helped persuade Milosevic to sign a peace
settlement that ended the 3 1/2-year war in Bosnia, has taken on a
diplomacy mission many see as a last-ditch attempt to stop the
conflict before NATO intervenes. He traveled Wednesday into the
heart of the battle zone and met with ethnic Albanian militants.
	   In the turbulent province, Holbrooke declared it was time for
Serb security forces to ``get out of here.''
	   Rugova was in Bonn, Germany, on Thursday, where he reiterated
demands for Kosovo's independence despite having been urged by NATO
officials that he abandon the push and resume peace talks with
Milosevic.
	   After meeting with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Rugova
intensified his appeal for NATO intervention in Kosovo, saying the
Serbs had sent about 80,000 ethnic Albanians fleeing from their
homes.
	   Kinkel said NATO should try to secure Russian support for
intervention in Kosovo. Russia has been a longtime ally of the
Serbs. ``We don't want to attack anyone,'' he said. ``We just want
to restore order on the ground.''
	   Rugova was meeting later with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Serb government officials assailed Holbrooke for meeting with
Albanian fighters and posing for photographs with them during an
inspection tour of Kosovo.
	   A hard-liner, Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj, said the meeting
proves the United States is ``training and arming the Albanian
terrorists, financially helping them, plotting and directing their
terrorist actions,'' the official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   He called for a halt to all talks on Kosovo with U.S. officials.
	   Holbrooke has dismissed any political significance to his talks
with two local Kosovo Liberation Army leaders in Junik, calling
them only unofficial meetings with armed men.
	   In the latest fighting, the Serbs' Media Center said Thursday
that armed Albanians killed a Serb schoolteacher in an attack late
Wednesday on the village of Kijevo west of Pristina.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said Serb-led government forces opened
grenade fire Thursday in a portion of territory in southwestern
Kosovo that Holbrooke visited the previous day.
	   In another sign of deterioration, armed Serb and Albanian
villagers, apparently not part of the KLA or the police, were
firing at each other in parts of Kosovo that until recently were
not engulfed in violence.

oil price figures. Picks up 4th graf pvs, Traders were ...
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ OPEC plans oil production cutbacks,
hoping to undo the damage it did to prices by an ill-judged
decision to start pumping more crude last winter.
	   World oil supplies are now so glutted that OPEC acknowledged
Thursday its plan to withdraw some 1.355 million barrels a day from
the market is not likely to have an immediate impact.
	   But the initial reaction on oil futures markets was negative,
with modest early losses on the London market worsening after New
York traders went to work.
	   Brent crude oil to be delivered in August was off by 41 cents at
dlrs 13.20 per barrel by late this afternoon on London's
International Petroleum Exchange. Light sweet crude oil for August
was down 58 cents at dlrs 14.02 at midday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
	   Traders were skeptical about whether OPEC will deliver its
latest promises, and it likely will be about six weeks before they
get initial indications about whether all the promised production
cuts are real.
	   Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete suggested that it might take
until October or November for prices to improve by around dlrs 3
per barrel.
	   But experts say that if OPEC sticks to its promises _ and this
is far from certain given the group's previous lack of willpower _
then prices could move sharply higher by early next year, shifting
the fortunes of global economies.
	   The OPEC president, United Arab Emirates oil minister Obaid bin
Saif al-Nasseri, vowed that the new cuts will ``banish the
volatility so plaguing the market.''
	   Algerian oil minister Youcef Yousfi said Thursday that if the
lower production fails to improve the market, then the exporters
might agree to curtail production more sharply.
	   ``If it is necessary to cut further, OPEC will meet and take a
decision,'' Yousfi said.
	   Firm prices would be a welcome relief to oil producers who
recently saw oil plunge to levels unseen since the industry's
disaster year of 1986. OPEC's average price was less than dlrs 11
per barrel last week, barely half the group's official target of
dlrs 21.
	   If OPEC's plans succeed, then consumers and oil-dependent
economies like Japan and Germany would stop getting such a huge
break on their fuel bills.
	   Leo Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Center for
Global Energy Studies, said OPEC's new deal appears to have a
``slow-burn fuse'' but that the promised production cuts are severe
enough to make supplies extremely tight in the longer term.
	   OPEC said its new production figures will stay in effect for one
year, starting July 1.
	   ``The duration, that's the key,'' Drollas said. ``That's the
sting in the tail. This, on paper, looks hideous for next year.
You're talking dlrs 25 oil.''
	   Not so fast, though.
	   OPEC was forced into action after its disastrous decision in
November to raise stated output by 10 percent. The extra oil
started flooding the market just as the southeast Asian economic
crisis began cutting into demand for crude oil, the world's most
vital commodity.
	   OPEC's new round of cuts _ following an earlier batch in March
that failed to improve depressed markets _ would put the group's
total output at around 26.5 million barrels a day, said the OPEC
secretary-general, Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria.
	   That would be around a half million barrels less than OPEC was
pumping before its most influential player, Saudi oil minister Ali
Naimi, pushed through last year's plan for higher production.
	   A wild card remains Iraq _ which is not participating in the
effort to produce less oil because its output is still held back by
U.N. sanctions imposed during the Gulf War.
	   The latest OPEC deal, and the earlier production cutbacks,
highlight a new partnership that conceivably could change the face
of global petroleum politics.
	   OPEC's top producer, Saudi Arabia, teamed up with Venezuela,
which has long been the biggest violator of OPEC's quota system,
and non-OPEC member Mexico to form the foundation of the cutback
arrangement.
	   In both sets of supply cuts, these unlikely partners agreed to
reduce oil output on the basis that any Saudi cuts would be matched
by the combined total from Venezuela and Mexico.
	   Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Non-OPEC
producers Russia, Oman, Egypt and Norway also participated in one
or both rounds of production cuts.

Only 10 percent of Russian graduates healthy: report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Only 10 percent of students graduating from
Russian schools can be considered healthy, according to a
government report released Thursday.
	   Some 45 percent to 50 percent of them have serious physical or
mental problems, according to the report presented by Tatyana
Markelova, chairwoman of the State Youth Committee.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency, which reported her comments, did not
indicate how the report defined good health or what it considered
serious health problems to be.
	   It said Markelova told a news conference that almost 2 percent
of Russian young people use drugs regularly and 8 percent more have
tried them at least once.

Italian deputies appeal against death penalty case in Virginia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Protesting the death sentence ordered for an Italian
immigrant, 240 deputies by Thursday had signed a petition asking
the state of Virginia to grant the man a new trial.
	   ``The death penalty is always wrong and morally unacceptable,''
read the petition circulated in the Chamber of Deputies, Italy's
lower legislative chamber. ``Adding to this, there are several
doubts on (Rocco Derek) Bernabei's guiltiness.''
	   No execution date has been set for Barnabei, who was convicted
of the slaying of his girlfriend. He has several avenues of appeals
left.
	   In line with Italy's stiff opposition to the capital punishment,
which is not allowed in this country, an Undersecretary for Foreign
Affairs, Patrizia Toia, said Wednesday she would bring Bernabei's
case to the attention of the European Union.
	   Italian government officials and various advocate groups have
spoken out on several other pending death penalty cases in the
United States.

Prosecution attacks Serb defendant in massacre trial 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The prosecution and defense
presented closing arguments on Thursday in the trial of a Serb
ex-mayor charged with playing a key role in the 1991 massacre of
200 Croats and non-Serbs.
	   Slavko Dokmanovic, the former mayor of the eastern Croatian city
of Vukovar, has pleaded innocent during the 28-day trial. He faces
up to life imprisonment if convicted; Judge Antonio Cassese of
Italy said a verdict was expected within two weeks.
	   Prosecutors have charged Dokmanovic with six counts of war
crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged participation in
the massacre near Vukovar, believed to be the worst atrocity of the
1991 Serb-Croat war.
	   ``The facts remain, the dead bodies remain ... and all the
revisionist history the defense has presented can't change that,''
said prosecutor Clint Williamson.
	   According to prosecutors, the day of Nov. 20, 1991, began at
Vukovar's hospital, where hundreds of people had sought refuge
after the city fell to forces of the Yugoslav National Army, known
as the JNA.
	   More than 200 Croatians and others from the hospital were
rounded up by JNA and Serb paramilitary soldiers and transported to
a nearby farm where they were beaten.
	   Afterwards, they were taken to a ravine where they were shot and
buried by a bulldozer in a mass grave, prosecutors allege.The
remains of the victims have since been exhumed.
	   Prosecutors said Dokmanovic is responsible for his active
participation in these incidents and for his failure to prevent and
stop the crimes as a civic leader.
	   ``Dokmanovic gave a blessing to the sadistic outpouring of
violence,'' Williamson said.
	   Perpetrators ``turned at least 200 living, breathing persons ...
into a jumble of dead bodies decomposing in an isolated grave,'' he
said.
	   Defense lawyer Toma Fila doggedly insisted the defendant was not
at any of the crime scenes, and that he lacked the military clout
to stop the ethnic violence around him.
	   Fila attacked and mocked the prosecution's arguments, calling
them ``Mickey Mouse proof.''
	   ``You have no proof at all, you just have assumptions,'' he
said.
	   Dokmanovic sat slightly hunched over on the table during
Thursday's session, and showed no outward signs of emotion.
	   Characterizing Dokmanovic, 48, as a family man with no previous
criminal record, Fila asked: ``Can that kind of person take part in
the killing of 200 persons?''
	   Three JNA officers also have been charged with responsibility
for the massacre, but they remain at large.
	   The U.N. tribunal, set up in 1993 by the Security Council, has
publicly indicted 60 people and has issued an unknown number of
secret indictments.

EU economic reform threatened by fear of unpopularity, says Britain 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pledges by European Union leaders to restrain
state spending and encourage labor flexibility will be tough to
fulfill because of fear of unpopularity, Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Thursday.
	   ``Even where there is widespread agreement that change is needed
... there is a strong sectional opposition to any change that would
damage any particular interest,'' said Cook, speaking to the Royal
Institute of International Affairs.
	   ``With national elections coming up all the time, making
progress can be difficult. The easy route would be to keep going
with a set of out-of-date and increasingly ineffective policies,''
he added.
	   Britain's Labor Party government, which has a huge parliamentary
majority and does not have to call elections for another four
years, had the 15 EU leaders pledge economic reforms at a summit in
Cardiff, Wales, this month.
	   The rotating six months presidency of the EU passes to Austria
in July.
	   Cook said the Labor Party government, which won power in May
last year from the Conservatives, had transformed Britain's
relations with the EU.
	   ``Now that we have stopped being so paranoid about federalism
and so scared of clever Continentals, we have realized that we
actually have a lot to offer Europe _ and that Europe has a lot to
offer us,'' said Cook.
	   He added that Britain should also not fear a French-German
alliance.
	   ``The friendship between France and Germany is one of the great
successes of the European Union and we need not feel threatened by
it,'' said Cook.
	   ``Instead, we should be grown up enough and secure enough to
realize that we can make our own mark, by offering Europe fresh
ideas, constructive solutions to its problems and the distinct
perspective that Britain enjoys.''

Prosecutor general calls for end to human rights abuse in prisons 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prosecutor general protested Thursday
against ``systematic'' human rights abuses in prisons, saying that
the Interior Ministry's plea of poverty was no excuse for appalling
sanitary conditions.
	   In a letter to Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, Prosecutor
General Yuri Skuratov said that criminal investigations had been
opened into inmates' deaths from dystrophy, or poor nutrition, in
several regions, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   He said that infections, food poisonings and a tuberculosis rate
five times the national average were plaguing the prison system.
	   Police have taken inadequate steps to meet sanitary norms and
that there was evidence that state money that had been appropriated
for prison maintenance had been misappropriated, ITAR-Tass reported
Skuratov as saying.
	   The United States and other western countries have criticized
Russia for inhuman conditions in its overcrowded prisons. A
commission under President Boris Yeltsin is pushing the lower house
of parliament to pass legislation against torture and other
inhumane treatment in the desperately overcrowded penal system.

Portuguese hospital staff stages strike, services disrupted 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A one-day strike over pay forced some
hospitals to cancel scheduled surgery and consultations Thursday.
	   The National Federation of Public Workers' Unions said more than
70 percent of the country's 30,000 hospital auxiliary workers,
including support staff, laundry workers and security guards,
heeded the strike call.
	   Minimum services, including emergency services, were maintained,
officials said.
	   The strike was called over the government's failure to put into
practice a 1996 deal with unions on pay hikes averaging 40,000
escudos (dlrs 217) per worker annually.
	   Health Minister Maria de Belem Roseira's office said no
statement was planned.

World Cup: Saudi dream remains dreamy 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) _ First Gulf nation to reach the second
round; first to be eliminated from the World Cup in 1998. Four
years has made a huge difference for Saudi Arabia.
	   After a memorable effort in 1994, Saudia Arabia carried the
hopes of Asia to France, and their extremely early exit made this
trip just as remarkable.
	   The worst of it was a 4-0 loss to France, a humiliating drubbing
which cost Carlos Alberto Parreira, who was back four years after
winning the title with Brazil, his job as coach.
	   The Saudis take their soccer very seriously, and the government
of the oil-rich kingdom pumps millions of dollars into the sport
every year, arranging camps around the world, building
state-of-the-art facilities and hiring famous coaches.
	   The world famous Brazilian, who joined the Saudis in December,
was fired only two days after the Saudis' loss to France and exited
from the championship.
	   The Saudis were at least expecting to repeat their 1994
accomplishment _ reach the second round. Parreira said it was
asking for too much.
	   ``They are not very good and they are not very bad,'' said
Parreira before the start of the championship.
	   He added that despite their South American playing style,
experience was in short supply.
	   From the start, the ``very demanding Saudis'' expected a repeat
of USA '94. Parreira had lower goals.
	   ``I said it right from the start that it will not be an easy
competition for us,'' said Parreira, who was coaching his fourth
different team at a World Cup finals.
	   Parreira said that despite being fast learners ``the Saudi
soccer is at an amateur level.
	   ``They have a long way to go before they can actually make their
mark.''
	   He blamed a lack of experience and only an average level of
fitness as the main reasons for their downfall.
	   Parreira took Saudi Arabia to France two months before the start
of the tournament, and spent much of his time working on fitness.
Still, the pace of the Saudis remained slow.
	   Saudi Arabia, managed to go home with a mere point after drawing
2-2 with South Africa in their last match on Wednesday.
	   It was a meaningless result, having already been eliminated, but
had the effect of ending the South Africans hopes too.
	   Mohammed al-Kharashi, named as Parreira's interim replacement,
told reporters after the match that the defeat should serve as a
lesson for the Saudis.
	   ``One day you win and another day you lose, that's what football
is all about,'' said al-Kharashi said, who studied under Parreira
12 years ago in Brazil.
	   ``You can't stop playing every time you lose a match and we have
to get used to that,'' al-Kharashi said.
	   ``We have to learn from the mistakes of the past and, InshaAllah
(God willing), e will do better in the next World Cup.''

	   The Saudis were at least expecting to repeat their 1994
accomplishment _ reach the second round. Parreira said it was
asking for too much.
	   ``They are not very good and they are not very bad,'' said
Parreira before the start of the championship.
	   He added that despite their South American playing style,
experience was in short supply.
	   From the start, the ``very demanding Saudis'' expected a repeat
of USA '94. Parreira had lower goals.
	   ``I said it right from the start that it will not be an easy
competition for us,'' said Parreira, who was coaching his fourth
different team at a World Cup finals.
	   Parreira said that despite being fast learners ``the Saudi
soccer is at an amateur level.
	   ``They have a long way to go before they can actually make their
mark.''
	   He blamed a lack of experience and only an average level of
fitness as the main reasons for their downfall.
	   Parreira took Saudi Arabia to France two months before the start
of the tournament, and spent much of his time working on fitness.
Still, the pace of the Saudis remained slow.
	   Saudi Arabia, managed to go home with a mere point after drawing
2-2 with South Africa in their last match on Wednesday.
	   It was a meaningless result, having already been eliminated, but
had the effect of ending the South Africans hopes too.
	   Mohammed al-Kharashi, named as Parreira's interim replacement,
told reporters after the match that the defeat should serve as a
lesson for the Saudis.
	   ``One day you win and another day you lose, that's what football
is all about,'' said al-Kharashi said, who studied under Parreira
12 years ago in Brazil.
	   ``You can't stop playing every time you lose a match and we have
to get used to that,'' al-Kharashi said.
	   ``We have to learn from the mistakes of the past and, InshaAllah
(God willing), e will do better in the next World Cup.''

Day before centrist Free Democrats' convention calls for Kohl to step down 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A day before the centrist Free Democrats
open their convention in Leipzig, the centrist coalition party in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government remained split Thursday over
demands he step down early if re-elected in September.
	   The Free Democratic leader in Bremen, Peter Braun, was quoted in
an interview with Bild newspaper as saying ``we want a clear
timetable for a staff change,'' from Kohl to Wolfgang Schaeuble,
the conservatives' party whip in parliament.
	   But Free Democratic Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt said in an
interview with the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper he would not
name a time for ``a changing of the guard,'' from Kohl to
Schaeuble.
	   The 68-year-old Kohl will have been in office nearly 16 years
when the election is held. He has said he favors Schaeuble, as his
successor, but has never indicated when that might be.
	   Guido Westerwelle, the general secretary of the Free Democrats,
has also insisted on Kohl making the ``generation change,'' to
Schaeuble and said Thursday that his own party had already done
that long ago.
	   In another interview with the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper,
Gerhardt said his main goal is to get badly-needed tax and other
reforms pushed through quickly with Kohl's conservative Christian
Democrats if the Sept. 27 elections are won.
	   The reforms theme is expected to dominate the party congress
that kicks off Friday.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After months of negotiations, the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed during an ambush in southern
Lebanon last year were returned to Israel Thursday, as part of a
swap with Lebanese guerrillas.
	   In exchange, Israel was to return the remains of 40 Hezbollah
guerrillas Thursday and release some 65 Lebanese prisoners Friday,
in the largest swap with Lebanon in two years.
	   Just hours before the planned exchange, Hezbollah detonated two
bombs in another ambush in south Lebanon, killing two Israeli
soldiers and wounding four others in on-going fighting between the
sides.
	   Official from the International Committee of the Red Cross and
the government of France, who helped broker Thursday's swap, the
remains of Sgt. Ist Class, Itamar Ilya to the Beirut International
Airport.
	   ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques Fresard, the man who negotiated the
deal, made the 50-minute flight aboard the French C-160 military
transport aircraft.
	   ``It's a mitzvah (Good deed) to return him to his family, to his
country,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said just
before the flight took off from Beirut.
	   Earlier in Beirut, officials from the Amal and Hezbollah
guerrilla groups, handed over body remains in their possession to
the Lebanese Army. In a statement, Hezbollah said it had handed
over the remains of Ilya and at least two other Israeli soldiers,
which were also brought to Israel.
	   Israeli officials had no comment regarding the Hezbollah claims
of body parts belonging to two other soldiers.
	   As several hundred people watched from balconies or gathered on
a street in south Beirut, Lebanese army medics transferred the
remains, placed in an icebox, from a Hezbollah ambulance to the
army ambulance outside a Hezbollah office.
	   The army ambulance then took off for Beirut airport, escorted by
other army vehicles.
	   A successful swap might give new impetus to efforts by Israel to
engage the Beirut government in negotiations on security
arrangements following an Israeli troop withdrawal from southern
Lebanon. The Lebanese government has refused to do so, saying U.N.
resolutions require Israel to leave without conditions.
	   The exchange was set in motion Wednesday when Israel began
digging up the bodies of 40 guerrillas killed in clashes in Israel,
including that of a son of Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah.
	   At a military airport outside Tel Aviv, a small guard of honor
of naval officers in white caps waited for the doors of the French
plane to open.
	   Ilya's parents were not at the airport, army officials said. The
army's chief chaplain was to board the plane first, to check the
remains, the army said.
	   Israel is to examine the body before returning the Hezbollah
guerrillas' remains to Beirut, possibly aboard the same plane.
	   A final phase of the swap was to take place Friday. Some 65
Hezbollah guerrillas were to be freed, about 15 from Israeli jails
and 50 from the Khiam lockup in south Lebanon run by an
Israeli-allied militia, the South Lebanon Army.

Supreme Court invalidates president's line-item veto 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Supreme Court struck down as
unconstitutional a law giving the president a line-item veto, which
let him cancel specific items in tax and spending measures.
	   Thursday's 6-3 decision said the law violates a stipulation in
the U.S. Constitution that requires every bill passed by the
Congress to be presented to the president for his signature of
approval or veto. The court said the constitutional language does
not allow what in effect would be partial vetoes.
	   The justices said that type of line-item veto could be
authorized only by amending the Constitution, an arduous process
done only 27 times in the document's 211-year history. The
line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho
potato growers' group after U.S. President Bill Clinton vetoed
provisions they sought that were granted by Congress.
	   Clinton was the first president to exercise a line-item veto, an
authority sought by almost every president this century as a tool
to limit wasteful politically based spending by Congress. Congress
enacted the veto in 1996, and Clinton used it 82 times last year.

Government can withhold support from indecent art 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The government can deny cash grants to artists
because their work is considered indecent, the Supreme Court ruled
Thursday, saying the policy does not violate artists' free-speech
rights.
	   The 8-1 decision said the National Endowment for the Arts can
consider decency as well as artistic merit in deciding who gets
public money for the arts.
	   The law ``neither inherently interferes with First Amendment
rights nor violates constitutional vagueness principles,'' Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
	   O'Connor wrote that the law imposes no categorical requirement
but amounts to ``advisory language'' that ``admonishes the NEA
merely to take 'decency and respect' into consideration.''
	   Congress set that standard in 1990 after a furor over the NEA's
role in funding such works as the homoerotic images of Robert
Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix immersed
in urine.
	   Lower courts struck down the law, saying it was too vague and
violated artists' free-speech rights under the Constitution's First
Amendment.

Moya becomes seventh men's seed eliminated AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: TOPS with Moya defeat; updates with Capriati loss
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon lost its seventh men's seed
Thursday when No. 5 Carlos Moya, the French Open champion, was
ousted in four sets by Morocco's Hicham Arazi.
	   Andre Agassi was in danger of becoming the eighth seed to lose
as he trailed two sets to one against Germany's Tommy Haas in a
match suspended Wednesday night.
	   In a Centre Court match between two players more acccomplished
on clay than grass, Arazi rallied to beat Moya 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.
	   Moya's defeat means five of the top eight seeds have been
eliminated in the first four days. The others are No. 2 Marcelo
Rios, No. 4 Greg Rusedski, No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and No. 8
Cedric Pioline.
	   Also out are No. 10 Alex Corretja, who lost to Moya in the
French Open final, and No. 15 Karol Kucera.
	   Of all the Spanish clay-court experts, Moya was considered the
player with the best all-around game and the best chance of
excelling at Wimbledon.
	   But he was thoroughly outplayed by Arazi, a clay-court master
who reached the French Open quarterfinals the last two years. The
French-based lefthander is considered one of the best shotmakers in
the game.
	   But the match, delayed twice by rain, never lived up to
expectations.
	   ``It wasn't a great match,'' Arazi said. ``I don't think we
played good tennis. It's not easy to play here on grass. It takes
time to get used to it. He was playing better than me in the
beginning, but after the rain, he started to make a lot of
mistakes.''
	   Jennifer Capriati, who won her first Grand Slam match in five
years Wednesday, couldn't keep up the momentum as she lost 4-6,
6-4, 6-2 to fellow American wild card Lori McNeil.
	   Martina Hingis hardly looked like a Wimbledon champion as she
struggled to a 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 victory over Elena Makarova, a
Russian ranked 79th in the world.
	   ``I made it tough on myself,'' Hingis said. ``It wasn't an
outstanding performance, I must say. Maybe tomorrow's a better
day.''
	   Lisa Raymond, who lost to Hingis in a tight, first-round match,
had said the Swiss teen-ager was ``vulnerable'' to an upset. And
that seemed true Wednesday, with Hingis facing a player who had won
only four matches all year.
	   When the match started after a half-hour rain delay, Hingis made
uncharacteristic unforced errors and seemed to rush her shots.
	   ``I was a little bit surprised by the way she played,'' Hingis
said. ``She served very well, played very fast. I tried to force it
more and more and made more and more mistakes.''
	   Makharova was poised to win the first set when she broke for a
5-4 lead. But the Russian double faulted to lose serve, then Hingis
held at love in the next game and dominated the tiebreaker.
	   Play was stopped because of showers at the start of the second
set. When the match resumed 30 minutes later, Hingis raced out to a
4-1 lead. But she faltered again as Makarova won three straight
games to tie the set at 4-4.
	   When Makarova broke in the eighth game, Hingis slammed the grass
with her racket and grimaced in anger. Hingis broke back in the
next game and then served out the match, closing with a backhand
winner.
	   Hingis, who last year at 16 became the youngest woman in 110
years to win Wimbledon, suspects it will be tougher to repeat.
	   ``Last year I didn't really expect myself doing so well,'' she
said. ``Now, because I know I can play on grass, there's probably a
little more pressure on myself. I want to do really well and
sometimes it doesn't work that well.''
	   In other early matches, No. 3 Jana Novotna was playing Tatiana
Panova.
	   When his match was halted Wednesday night, Agassi was furious
over a crucial line call that helped Haas win the third set.
	   A forehand by Haas was ruled good, even though replays showed it
was clearly out.
	   Agassi stabbed the spot where he saw the ball land, then
approached chair umpire John Frame.
	   ``It was nearly six inches (out),'' he protested. ``It was out
both ways. It was wide and it was long.''
	   Frame shook his head and the call stood, giving Haas a 6-3 lead
in the tiebreaker. Agassi saved one set point, but succumbed on the
next to fall behind 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Play was then suspended, and Agassi resumed his protest.
	   ``In 12 years, I've never seen it miss that much,'' he said to
Frame.
	   The Centre Court crowd jeered the umpire and linesmen as they
left the court.

High Court rules attorney-client privilege shields notes 
</HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Supreme Court thwarted special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr's effort to get notes taken by White House aide
Vincent Foster's lawyer during a meeting shortly before Foster's
1993 suicide.
	   By a 6-3 vote, the court ruled Thursday that the attorney-client
privilege of confidentiality, embodied in American legal practice,
protects against disclosure of the notes even after Foster shot
himself.
	   The decision, a setback for Independent Counsel Starr, will have
an enormous lasting impact on the legal profession and all
Americans who at some time seek a lawyer's help.
	   A White House official accompanying U.S. President Bill Clinton
in China called the ruling ``an important validation of the vital
issue of attorney-client privilege.''
	   The justices overturned a federal appeals court ruling that
Washington lawyer James Hamilton's three pages of notes might have
to be surrendered to a grand jury that issued a subpoena for them
in 1995.
	   The investigative panel headed by Starr wanted the notes for its
probe into allegations of misdeeds within the Clinton White House.
Specifically Starr expected to find information in the documents
about the role of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president's wife, in
the firing of the White House travel office's staff.
	   ``It has been generally, if not universally, accepted for well
over a century that the attorney-client privilege survives the
death of the client in a case such as this,'' Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.

	   As several hundred people watched from balconies and on the
street in south Beirut, Lebanese army medics transferred the
remains, placed in an icebox, from a Hezbollah ambulance to the
army ambulance outside a Hezbollah office.
	   The army ambulance then took off for Beirut airport, escorted by
other army vehicles.
	   A successful swap might give new impetus to efforts by Israel to
engage the Beirut government in negotiations on security
arrangements following an Israeli troop withdrawal from southern
Lebanon. The Lebanese government has refused to do so, saying U.N.
resolutions require Israel to leave without conditions.
	   The exchange was set in motion Wednesday when Israel began
digging up the bodies of 40 guerrillas killed in clashes in Israel,
including a son of Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah.
	   At a military airport outside Tel Aviv, a small guard of honor
of naval officers in white caps waited for the doors of the French
plane to open.
	   Ilya's parents were not at the airport, army officials said.
	   Israel is to examine the body before returning the Hezbollah
guerrillas' remains to Beirut, possibly aboard the same plane.
	   A final phase of the swap was to take place Friday. Some 65
Hezbollah guerrillas were to be freed: 15 from Israeli jails and 50
from the Khiam lockup in south Lebanon run by an Israeli-allied
militia, the South Lebanon Army.

Mexico expels three accused of collaboration with armed Basque group 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mexico expelled three men Thursday wanted
in Spain for questioning about attacks blamed on armed Basque
separatists.
	   Pedro Maria Celarain, Ignacio Miguel Azcue and Juan Luis
Caminero were detained Wednesday in Mexico.
	   Celarain, 49, and Azcue, 21, are accused of participating in
several attacks of the armed separatist group ETA while Caminero,
28, face a six-year prison jail term for attacking a policeman
during a town festival in the northern Basque region, said Interior
Ministry spokeswoman Angeles Morejon.
	   The three men, allegedly collaborators of the armed separatist
group ETA, were arrested by Spanish police on arrival at the Madrid
airport.
	   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed
nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for the independence of
northern Spain's three Basque provinces.
	   Mexico has expelled 10 suspected ETA members since 1996 when it
and Spain agreed to increase cooperation in fighting terrorism.
	   Dozens of suspected members of the group are believed to live
outside Spain, especially in neighboring France and Latin American
countries.

Russian parliament delays consideration of emergency economic measures Kazakstan, edits to conform.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's opposition-dominated parliament decided
Thursday to delay consideration of a package of emergency economic
measures until next week despite Kremlin pressure for speedy
approval.
	   The measures are needed to implement a new budget-cutting,
revenue-raising plan designed to win new loans from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Russia's financial markets have been falling for months, with
investors put off by the Asian crisis, plummeting oil prices and
the possibility of social unrest.
	   The IMF was to decide later Thursday whether to release a
delayed dlrs 670 installment of an existing loan. A decision on
Russia's request for a new, dlrs 10-15 billion stabilization loan
is expected to take several weeks.
	   Japan's ambassador to Russia, Takehiro Togo, said Thursday that
his country and Russia's other partners in the Group of Eight
leading industrialized countries would support the IMF's granting
of such a loan.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko submitted the austerity plan to
the IMF on Wednesday, and asked parliament's lower house to pass
the necessary legislation quickly.
	   Kiriyenko said that if the bills are passed into law, they will
bring Russia's monthly budget revenues up to 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 4 billion), Russian news agencies reported.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said that the package of six
tax reform bills, which the Cabinet approved Thursday before
sending to it to the Duma, should net the budget almost 37 billion
rubles (dlrs 6 billion) annually.
	   In spite of the government's request for quick action, the Duma
scheduled debate of the proposed legislation for July 1 _ just two
days before it is scheduled to recess for the summer.
	   Kiriyenko promised that the Cabinet was ready to work with
parliament and that its members _ in contrast to the legislative
branch _ were ``ready to put off all vacations and trips,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   President Boris Yeltsin said he would put off a visit to the
former Soviet republic of Kazakstan, which had been scheduled for
next week, until September so he could work on solving the economic
crisis at home.
	   Kiriyenko warned that ``without the passing of these draft laws,
the anti-crisis program will not work,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The Duma is dominated by Communists and other hard-liners who
oppose Yeltsin and his economic policies.

Remains of Israeli soldier returned to Israel With Lebanon-Israel

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After months of negotiations, the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed during an ambush in southern
Lebanon last year were returned to Israel Thursday, as part of a
swap with Lebanese guerrillas.
	   In exchange, Israel was to return the remains of 40 Hezbollah
guerrillas the same day and release some 65 Lebanese prisoners
Friday, the largest swap with Lebanon in two years.
	   Just hours before the planned exchange, Hezbollah detonated two
bombs in another ambush in south Lebanon, killing two Israeli
soldiers and wounding four others in on-going fighting between the
sides.
	   Officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross and
the government of France, who helped broker Thursday's swap,
accompanied the remains of Sgt. Ist Class, Itamar Ilya to Beirut
International Airport.
	   ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques Fresard, the man who negotiated the
deal, made the 50-minute flight aboard the French C-160 military
transport aircraft.
	   ``It's a mitzvah (Good deed) to return him to his family, to his
country,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said just
before the flight took off from Beirut.
	   Earlier in Beirut, officials from the Amal and Hezbollah
guerrilla groups handed over body parts in their possession to the
Lebanese Army.
	   In a statement, Hezbollah said it had also handed over the
remains of at least two other Israeli soldiers. Israeli officials
had no comment and the claim could not be immediately verified.
	   As several hundred people watched from balconies and on the
street outside a Hezbollah office in south Beirut, Lebanese army
medics transferred the remains, placed in an icebox, from a
Hezbollah ambulance to the army ambulance. The army ambulance left
for Beirut airport, with an army escort.
	   A successful swap might give new impetus to efforts by Israel to
engage the Beirut government in negotiations on security
arrangements following an Israeli troop withdrawal from southern
Lebanon. The Lebanese government has refused to do so, saying U.N.
resolutions require Israel to leave without conditions.
	   The exchange was set in motion Wednesday when Israel began
digging up the bodies of 40 guerrillas killed in clashes in Israel,
including a son of Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah.
	   At a military airport outside Tel Aviv, a small guard of honor

Hezbollah guerrillas were to be freed: 15 from Israeli jails and 50
from the Khiam lockup in south Lebanon run by an Israeli-allied
militia, the South Lebanon Army.
	   Thursday's fatalities raised to eight the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in southern Lebanon this year. In 1997, 39 Israeli
soldiers were killed in guerrilla attacks, a record annual figure
since 1985 when Israel set up the occupied zone to protect its
northern towns from guerrilla attacks.

Modest growth in the insurance industry, says report 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The world insurance market saw modest
growth in 1996, the most recent year for which figures are
available, according to a report released Thursday.
	   Total premium volume _ the amount paid by policyholders for
insurance protection _ was dlrs 2.1 trillion, representing a growth
rate of just 1 percent in real terms and a drop from the 1995
figure of 3.7 percent, said the study by the Swiss Reinsurance
Company's economic research department.
	   Growth rates dipped sharply compared with 1995 in both the
non-life and life insurance businesses, with increases of 0.5
percent and 1.3 percent respectively, falling back to the same
levels as at the beginning of the decade.
	   The biggest insurance markets were the United States, with a 31
percent share (dlrs 653 billion), and Japan with 24.7 percent (dlrs
520 billion).
	   Growth rates in most regions including North America, Western
Europe and South and East Asia were below long-term averages, the
report said.
	   Premiums stagnated in Eastern Europe and declined in Japan and
Latin America. Life insurers in Japan saw premium volumes fall by
more than 7 percent, said the study.
	   It said Japanese life insurers were badly hit by the previous
years' slump in the real estate and stock markets, which led to
massive write-offs on capital assets.
	   In North America, the report said increased capacity in the
market led to more competition for market share, causing premium
volumes to fall.
	   Steady liberalization in Europe allowing new providers into the
market has also led to tougher competition.
	   The Swiss spent most on insurance in 1996, shelling out dlrs
4,663 per inhabitant _ roughly twice as much as North America.

Army makes money selling off obsolete equipment 
</HEADLINE>
By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA 
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Excavators and bulldozers were among the
hot items sold by a government agency dealing with obsolete army
property, which has earned some 5 million zlotys (dlrs 1.4 million)
in its first six months of operation, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   Col. Wieslaw Rozbicki of the Army Property Agency told The
Associated Press that among some 20,000 items it offers, ranging
from shoe strings to military airports, construction equipment has
been easiest to sell.
	   Another real hit are mobile electricity generators and kitchens,
he said.
	   Local authorities use the generators as backup in hospitals and
offices, farmers use them as a cheap source of lighting and
heating. Others make small fortunes selling hot sausages from
former army kitchens, Rozbicki said.
	   Military equipment, munition and guns can be only sold to
licensed companies or individuals with weapons permits.
	   But a tank, on offer in the southwestern region of Wroclaw, can
go to a foreign collector or to firefighters, after it is disarmed.
	   ``A tank would be ideal to cut off fire-affected areas in woods,
where it would be dangerous for people to go,'' Rozbicki said
advertising the bulky goods on stock.
	   Started in October with 10 million zlotys (dlrs 2.9 million)
from the Defense Ministry, the agency sells or leases property that
the Polish Army finds obsolete as it adjusts to NATO standards and
cuts down on the number of troops and equipment.
	   Rozbicki hopes the agency will start bringing profit next year.
	   ``We look for the best ways of using the army property, be it
sale, rent or lease,'' Rozbicki said.
	   Hard to sell will be five airports, which are large territory,
often in woods, far from cities or any business, he said. Dividing
them into smaller units for holiday resorts may be a solution.
	   The agency has held some 12 auctions this year and is planning
350 more, expecting to funnel some 7 million zlotys (dlrs 2
million) to the ministry. Some 70 percent of the proceeds go for
modernization of the army, the rest remains in the agency, which is
self-financing. The auctions are also open to foreigners.

	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on declining Japanese currency:
	   Monetary authorities in Japan and the United States have begun a
concerted intervention in the foreign exchange markets to put a
stop to the sharp decline in the value of the yen. ... The
concerted intervention is a first step forward. But successfully
drawing the United States into foreign exchange market rescue
operations does not mean the malaise that caused the `sell-off of
Japan' has been cured. Unless the rot is removed as soon as
possible, there will be renewed pressure to sell the yen.
	   Steps for restoring confidence in Japan must be taken promptly,
taking advantage of this brief grace period. The most urgent among
them is to liquidate the bad loans saddling the banking system _ a
move that is long overdue.
	   We want the prime minister, after coming up with a concrete
timetable for dealing with the bad loans, to declare that he has
the political will to enrich people's lives by eliminating their
fears about the future. He should do this by changing his approach
to precious budget allocations.
	    &UR; ___
	   Buenos Aires Herald, on Japanese economy:
	   Even if United States support for the yen vouchsafed global
stock markets at least a temporary reprieve last week, there does
not seem to be excessive pessimism underlying the decision. ... The
plunging shares early last week should be viewed with more alarm
than the ``Tequila Crisis'' of 1994-5 in Mexico.
	   If the Japanese economy contracted by an annual rate of 5.3
percent in the first quarter of this year, there is every prospect
of the real economy eventually being hit here. The most worrying
aspects of this crisis are that it is in many ways inevitable and
that it feeds on several countries other than Japan.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Cork (Ireland) Examiner, on Northern Ireland:
	   Those who said the two referenda, North and South, held last
month to ratify the Good Friday Agreement, would be the beginning
rather than the end of a process were very prescient. ...
	   Hard-line elements on the fringes of the republican movement are
still determined to resort to violence to defeat what they see as a
sellout. Similarly, and this is a far more serious threat, sizable
segments of the Unionist opinion are either very lukewarm about
aspects of the agreement and the machinery flowing from it, or are
openly opposed to it. The strength of that opposition will be
tested in a very crucial manner tomorrow with the elections for the
108 seats in the new Northern Assembly. ...
	   The outcome still looks good for the parties backing the
agreement, but matters have not been helped by the insistence of
Unionists in the North and the Conservative Party in London to link
the release of prisoners with the decommissioning of paramilitary
arms.
	   Two developments would help matters considerably and advance the
cause of peace: a clear and unambiguous declaration by Sinn Fein
that the `armed struggle' is over, and the adoption on the Unionist
side of a realistic attitude to decommissioning.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on East Timor:
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie's offer on East Timor is a
dramatic leap for Jakarta to take but one that falls short of
meeting the demands of the East Timorese themselves. Habibie says
he is prepared to release the resistance leader Xanana Gusmao from
prison immediately, to order a troop withdrawal from East Timor and
to grant wide powers of autonomy to the territory. The price:
international recognition of Indonesia's 1976 annexation of East
Timor. Gusmao has rejected the offer, saying that there won't be a
solution without a referendum on full independence. The question
now is whether these two inflexible positions can be massaged into
a compromise acceptable to all sides. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Corriere Della Sera, Milan, Italy, on United States-Iran soccer
match:
	   During the whole two hours of the soccer game between the United
States and Iran last Sunday, the American people, led by President
Bill Clinton, couldn't keep away from the screens. The Superpower
stopped and prayed for its boys.
	   There was no miracle and victory expectations were disappointed.
...
	   But it has been the day for the peace spirit to win over the
spirit of war. The defeat has maybe wounded America, but has also
sanctioned the triumph of sports and diplomacy. ...

Day before centrist Free Democrats' convention calls for Kohl to step down 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDs Schaeuble's age in 4th graf
<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ A day before the centrist Free Democrats
open their convention in Leipzig, the centrist coalition party in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government remained split Thursday over
demands he step down early if re-elected in September.
	   The Free Democratic leader in Bremen, Peter Braun, was quoted in
an interview with Bild newspaper as saying ``we want a clear
timetable for a staff change,'' from Kohl to Wolfgang Schaeuble,
the conservatives' party whip in parliament.
	   But Free Democratic Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt said in an
interview with the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper he would not
name a time for ``a changing of the guard,'' from Kohl to
Schaeuble.
	   The 68-year-old Kohl will have been in office nearly 16 years
when the election is held. He has said he favors Schaeuble as his
successor, but has never indicated when that might be. Schaeuble
will be 56 on Sept. 8.
	   Guido Westerwelle, the general secretary of the Free Democrats,
has also insisted on Kohl making the ``generation change,'' to
Schaeuble and said Thursday that his own party had already done
that long ago.
	   In another interview with the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper,
Gerhardt said his main goal is to get badly-needed tax and other
reforms pushed through quickly with Kohl's conservative Christian
Democrats if the Sept. 27 elections are won.
	   The reforms theme is expected to dominate the party congress
that kicks off Friday.

	    &UR; ___
	   Le Figaro, Paris, on World Cup violence:
	   England and Germany are primarily responsible for the (World
Cup) violence that occurred in France. The English hooligans who
vandalized Marseille are the product of a ``Francophobia'' fueled
by Britain, more specifically by certain newspapers.
	   The German thugs who terrorized Lens and seriously injured a
policeman Monday are the heirs of a neo-Nazi ideology which is
minor but nevertheless tolerated.
	   We need to ask ourselves: should these two countries not be
sanctioned?
	   Of course, France is not in the best position to preach: some
extremist supporters also have blemished the name of some big
clubs, especially in Paris.
	   Nevertheless, never had such levels of hatred been reached.
	   If this barbaric behavior continues, the question of whether
these nations should be allowed to continue in the World Cup should
be addressed.
	    &UR; ___
	   Nhan Dan, Vietnam, on U.S. economic sanctions:
	   President Clinton on June 20 publicly lamented that the U.S. has
depended too much on imposing economic sanctions against other
countries. President Clinton could not conceal his view when he
said he was very frustrated with the U.S. becoming a country which
likes sanctions.
	   It is obvious that U.S. foreign policy of imposing sanctions ...
has become outdated and cannot be used as the instrument for its
superpower dominating role at a time when other countries have been
advancing toward freedom and equality and are affirming their right
to national self-determination and maintaining national
sovereignty. ...
	   Things that are new, progressive and suitable ... are welcomed.
They are, however, difficult to implement because there are still a
number of forces (in the U.S. Congress) who want to create some
hurdles.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Herald, Everett, Washington, on NATO and Yugoslavia:
	   NATO jets have moved Yugoslavia in the right direction. But the
Clinton administration must keep up the pressure.
	   Just one day after 80 NATO warplanes flew near his troops that
are attacking civilians in the province of Kosovo, Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic announced he would like to resume
settlement talks. The breakthrough came while Milosevic was
visiting Russian President Boris Yeltsin, his ally. Yeltsin
apparently agreed with President Bill Clinton on the need to
restore substantial autonomy for Kosovo's majority of ethnic
Albanians.
	   Getting Milosevic to talk is only a start. The real goal must be
a rapid end to the fighting in Kosovo. Milosevic cannot be allowed
to ignite a new war in the Balkans. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Miami Herald, on conflict between Ecuador and Peru:
	   The end is in sight _ if only Peru and Ecuador can get past the
scars of a nearly two-centuries-old border dispute. ... The two
nations have been at war three times. ... The last skirmish, a

	   The New York Times, on Israel's redrawing the boundaries of
Jerusalem:
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has chosen an
awkward moment to redraw the boundaries of Jerusalem, one of the
most sensitive issues in the Mideast peace talks. The point of
those talks is to resolve disputed issues by negotiation and
compromise, not by one side's acting on its own.
	   At Mr. Netanyahu's behest, Washington has been trying to find a
formula to move the peace talks forward to the toughest remaining
issues. These include boundaries within greater Jerusalem, the
future of Jewish settlements and the political status of
Palestinian-controlled areas. Mr. Netanyahu says he still wants
such accelerated talks. But if he means to negotiate in good faith,
he should not now be redrawing the political boundaries of greater
Jerusalem. ...

	   Tulsa World, Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Clinton and China relations:
	   President Clinton will carry a lot of baggage when he leaves for
China this week. His heaviest bags are political.
	   Clinton is the first American president in nine years to visit
China. His trip is surrounded by the controversy of questionable
campaign donations from Chinese and the sale of U.S. satellite
technology to China.
	   Clinton also will attend a rally in Tiananmen Square, the site
of the pro-democracy rally in 1989 that was violently quashed by
the Chinese government. Clinton, when running for president in
1992, sharply criticized China for its attack there and promised to
take strong measures against China until that country came into
compliance with human rights standards.
	   China's way of getting ready for a dignitary leaves a lot to be
desired. Democratic dissidents have been harassed or jailed;
Chinese-Americans have been prevented from visiting relatives in
China.
	   China is not exactly an American's idea of a country on the way
to democracy.
	   But, Clinton is doing the right thing in going to China. It is,
after all, the most populous country in the world. It also holds
the keys to peace in Southeast Asia and, with its nuclear
capability, remains a country that is better dealt with than
bullied. ...

	   Just about the time we think our society is moving past the bad
race relations of the past into a world of the future in which
people are judged ``not by the color of their skin but by the

relations. ...
	   The responsibility lies not just with whites to eliminate
racism, but also with blacks. It will take us working together to
solve this problem.

Kuwait journalists call for canceling prison sentence on editor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwaiti journalists have called on the government
to annul a 6-month prison sentence imposed on an editor convicted
of insulting Islam.
	   The Kuwait Journalists Association also urged the government to
amend the law on publications to make it compatible with the
country's ``democratic atmosphere,'' the professional union said in
a statement issued Wednesday night.
	   A court sentenced the editor of the opposition newspaper,
al-Qabas, and a freelance Egyptian journalist to six months in jail
on Wednesday for publishing a cartoon deemed to have insulted
Islam.
	   The cartoon, published Jan. 5 on the entertainment page, showed
a teacher asking his students, ``why did God kick out Adam and Eve
from heaven?'' A student answers: ``Because they hadn't paid the
rent.''
	   The editor, Mohammed Jassim al-Saqar, defended the cartoon,
saying ``it was only a joke.''
	   It was the first time an editor was sentenced to jail in Kuwait,
which has one of the freest media in the region. The freelancer,
Ibrahim Marzouk, who filed the cartoon from Egypt, was sentenced in
absentia.
	   Al-Saqar and Marzouk were prosecuted after Islamist legislators
complained to the Information Ministry.
	   In its statement, the journalists association called on the
government to ``cancel'' the prison sentence and added: ``It is
necessary to carry out fundamental amendments to the publication
law so that it suits the democratic atmosphere and general freedom
that Kuwait enjoys.''
	   A group of liberal intellectuals and legislators, the Kuwaiti
Democratic Platform, criticized the sentence Thursday as harsh.
	   ``We express our fear that this verdict will set a precedent in
imprisoning journalists and writers as if they were criminals or
corrupt persons who deserve harsh punishment.''

World Cup: Netherlands and Mexico qualify 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: optional
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) _ Just before the curtain fell, ``El
Matador'' brought the crowd to its feet.
	   Five minutes into second-half injury time, in the last of a
frantic series of assaults on the Dutch goal, Luis Hernandez shook
off defender Jaap Stam and poked the ball under goalkeeper Edwin
van der Sar to give Mexico a 2-2 draw with the Netherlands.
	   It was Hernandez' third goal of the World Cup, and the draw
qualified both teams for the second round. It also capped another
great comeback for the Mexicans, who rallied from 2-0 down to tie
Belgium 2-2 in their previous game.
	   ``I am happy. It was an unbelievable game,'' said Hernandez, who
was a doubtful starter because of an ankle injury. ``It was a
fantastic game for us. A triumph for Mexico and the Mexican
people.''
	   The result placed the Dutch in first place in Group E, ahead of
Mexico on goal differential. Belgium, which needed a victory to
stay alive, finished third after a 1-1 draw with South Korea.
	   ``We didn't do what we wanted in the first half,'' Mexico coach
Manuel Lapuente said. ``I told my players not to lose faith. With
faith you move mountains. They have a big heart and they displayed
that all over the field.''
	   Phillip Cocu and Ronald de Boer had the goals for the Dutch, who
relaxed late after dominating most of the game.
	   ``This was a game in which we cannot be satisfied,'' Dutch coach
Guus Hiddink said. ``For one or other reason, we settled too much
and we did not defend like we like to defend.''
	   Ricardo Pelaez scored for Mexico in the 75th minute. Cuauhtemoc
Blanco also netted in the 89th, but was whistled for offsides.
Ramon Ramirez was given a red card for protesting the call and will
miss Mexico's second round match Monday.
	   The cool, wet conditions were ideally-suited to the fast,
fluent, attacking tactics of the Dutch, and they got the early goal
in the fifth minute when Cocu ran on to a neat flicked pass by
Dennis Bergkamp and fired a low, hard shot past the dive of
goalkeeper Jorge Campos.
	   It was Cocu's second goal in two matches since being promoted
from a defensive midfielder's role to the forward line in a
surprise switch forced on Dutch coach Guus Hiddink by the two-game
suspension of Patrick Kluivert.
	   De Boer followed with one of the best individual efforts of the
tournament. He shook off three challenges before sending the ball
between the legs of defender Joel Sanchez and off the left post,
catching Campos moving in the wrong direction.
	   Campos made a nice save on Bergkamp in the 30th minute, but he
didn't have a chance against Marc Overmars' chip shot that drifted
tantalizingly wide of the post in the 40th. Cocu also hit the
crossbar in the 50th minute.
	   Mexico, ragged and ineffective for much of the game, finally got
on the board when Pelaez rose above the Dutch defense to head home
German Villa's corner kick. The ball bounced untouched through a
scrum of two Dutch players and one Mexican and into the net.
	   ``We did not keep up the pace,'' Bergkamp said. ``It felt like
we were in a downward spiral in the second half.''
	   Until the final minutes, the most dramatic Mexican performance
came from a fan climbed onto the beams on the underside of the roof
covering the stands. The man then shimmied more than 30 meters down
a huge pole to the wild cheers of fellow Mexican supporters. He was
escorted away by stewards.

Voters pick who will govern Northern Ireland into new era 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs; will be led with RTE exit poll data 2300gmt
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Knowing that their choices
could make or break a peace agreement, Northern Ireland's voters on
Thursday selected the men and women who will govern their divided
land in a new power-sharing Assembly.
	   Results for the 108-seat Assembly, the central plank of the
April 10 agreement that most voters endorsed in a referendum last
month, won't be confirmed until late Friday or even Saturday. But
the Irish national broadcasters RTE planned to present exit poll
data soon after Northern Ireland's 1,220 polling stations closed at
10 p.m. (2100gmt).
	   The implications for the peace process couldn't be higher in
this election, which begins the process of returning government
power from London back to Belfast after a bloody generation of
conflict.
	   Unlike the previous Protestant-dominated parliament that the
British abolished in 1972, the new Assembly is designed to ensure
that neither Protestants nor Catholics can impose their will on the
other side.
	   ``The guiding spirit of our agreement means that there can be no
victories by either side, because in a divided society, victories
are not solutions,'' said John Hume, leader of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, after casting his ballot in his native
Londonderry.
	   Hume, a prime architect of the successful negotiations, expects
his moderate Catholic party to be rewarded at the polls _ with an
outside chance to become the largest party in the Assembly.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, whose IRA-allied party has made
strides in winning Catholic votes since the Irish Republican Army's
abortive 1994 cease-fire, has downplayed his ambitions of
overtaking Hume's SDLP for the first time.
	   Both Hume and Adams are united in support for the agreement. By
contrast the leaders of Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant
majority are bitterly divided over the deal, particularly the
prospect of sharing power with Sinn Fein.
	   Two hard-line parties _ both of which boycotted the talks once
Sinn Fein gained admission after the IRA renewed its cease-fire in
July 1997 _ are running on a promise to obstruct key functions of
the Assembly.
	   ``Come Friday the world will see what the Protestant people
really think of this so-called peace process, which is really a
surrender process,'' said the Rev. Ian Paisley, whose Democratic
Unionists have estimated that Protestants opposed to the agreement
will need to win about 30 seats in the Assembly to block decisions.
	   The biggest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, is running
the most candidates at 48. But at least six are publicly opposed to
their leader David Trimble's acceptance of the agreement.
	   Trimble, voting with his wife Daphne beside him, predicted his
party would triumph comfortably among Protestants, while Paisley
and his ``dinosaur'' allies would struggle to get 20 percent of the
overall vote.
	   ``The Ulster Unionist Party is committed to making this
agreement work, and to making Northern Ireland work for all its
people,'' Trimble said.
	   But hopes for a peaceful future mixed with the realities of the
latest car bomb. Many voters in the village of Newtownhamilton, its
main street of shops and homes badly damaged in Wednesday's blast,
said they were too busy picking up the pieces of their shattered
property to vote.
	   A small anti-British gang, the Irish National Liberation Army,
claimed responsibility for the attack.
	   For the village's minority of Protestant residents, the attack
illustrated why they're so opposed to compromise with IRA
supporters.
	   ``We've given these people every chance in the world to come
into democratic politics, and they still bomb us,'' said Andrea
Clark, a Protestant woman sweeping glass and plaster out of her
boarded-up bakery.
	   Last year her home in nearby Markethill was wrecked when IRA
dissidents set off another car bomb.
	   ``When you offer to give them half a loaf, they just go on
asking for the whole loaf anyway,'' she said.

Talks under way, but coalition not in sight 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Havel meeting Zeman. ADDs byline
By JAN SLIVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Talks on the future government
continued for the second day Thursday, but formation of a stable
coalition still appears to be weeks away.
	   The leader of the Social Democrats, Milos Zeman, met with
Christian Democrats' leader Josef Lux to try and figure out how the
two parties could work within the same Cabinet.
	   Zeman's party won last week's elections, but has only 74 seats
in the 200-seat legislature, and lacks obvious center-left allies
that could give him a majority needed to form a government.
	   ``At this stage, we are discussing different coalition
combinations,'' Zeman told Czech radio after the meeting with Lux.
``Some of them are acceptable, some are not.''
	   Zeman met with President Vaclav Havel late Thursday to inform
him of progress made. He said he had ``three variants of a possible
coalition ready.'' He refused to give other details, but ruled out
a coalition with the election runner-up, the Civic Democratic Party
of former Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   Negotiations for the future Cabinet began almost immediately
after elections _ held two years early in a vain attempt to
overcome a political deadlock _ but are expected to take weeks to
complete.
	   While Zeman is leaning toward a minority two-party government
with the center-right Christian Democrats, Lux fears that the
government could fall hostage to the old-guard Communists under
such a scenario.
	   The Communists are the third-strongest party, with 24 seats, but
all four remaining parties have rejected them as coalition partners
because of their past and lack of will to reform.
	   Communist leader Miroslav Grebenicek has repeatedly said his
party could support a coalition of Social Democrats and Christian
Democrats.
	   Lux, whose party captured 20 seats, wants the Freedom Union of
Jan Ruml to join Zeman's government.
	   ``In such a grand coalition ... we would defend right-wing
values, as is usual in grand coalitions,'' Lux told the radio.
	   Zeman, who also met Thursday with Ruml, told journalists he made
``certain proposals'' to Ruml's party and said it was now up to
Freedom Union members to discuss them.
	   Ruml has repeatedly rejected the idea of a coalition with the
Social Democrats.
	   ``This phase of negotiations is only informative and I told Mr.
Zeman that our stand is unchangeable,'' Ruml said.
	   His party seems to prefer a center-right government formed with
Lux and the Civic Democratic Party .
	   Should Zeman fail in his efforts to build a stable coalition,
President Vaclav Havel will likely ask Klaus to attempt the same.
Klaus' party won 63 seats in the elections.

High-level U.S. delegation heading for Nigeria 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States is sending a high-level
delegation to Nigeria to urge on that country's new government a
quick and credible transition to civilian democracy, the State
Department said Thursday.
	   Susan Rice, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
also suggested that Nigeria's cooperation with U.S. anti-drug
efforts might improve. That would allow the government to lift
sanctions imposed under Washington's drug cooperation certification
program.
	   ``We would hope that over the next several months we can work
together and make progress sufficient to enable us to review in a
positive light our decerticifation decision when it next comes up
for review,'' Rice said at a hearing before the International
Relations Committee of the House of Representatives.
	   She said the administration is encouraged by steps taken by
Nigeria's new leader, Abdulsalam Abubakar, since he took over on
the death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha this month. Abubakar has
released several prominent political prisoners and has expressed
willingness to start a dialogue with representatives of various
political groups.
	   ``These are hopeful signs that lead us to be relatively more
encouraged than we were ... just a month ago,'' Rice said.
``Obviously we need to continue to watch carefully and not make any
decisions or judgments that would unduly tie our own hands. ...
There's reason for caution as well.''
	   Rice also expressed hope for the quick and unconditional release
of Moshood Abiola, jailed in 1994 a year after winning Nigeria's
presidential elections. She said the United States wants him to be
allowed to participate freely in a democratic electoral process.
	   Rice said Thomas Pickering, the State Department's third-ranking
official and a former ambassador to Nigeria, will head a delegation
to Nigeria soon.
	   ``We are seeking to encourage the emergence of a stable,
prosperous, democratic Nigeria that respects human rights,'' said
Rice. ``We believe for that to be possible there needs to be a
credible transition to civilian democracy as soon as possible.''
	   The State Department had planned to send a mission to Nigeria
before Abacha's death. But that visit was canceled after Abacha's
government demanded the lifting of travel restrictions on Nigerian
officials in the United States.

Thousands of Mexicans turn out to celebrate soccer qualification

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With 2,000 riot police standing nearby,
thousands of fans thronged Mexico City's streets with their faces
painted in the national colors to celebrate Mexico's qualification
Thursday for the second round of the World Cup.
	   Singing ``We proved we could,'' throngs of teen-agers in Mexico
City, Monterrey and Guadalajara rejoiced about Mexico's 2-2 tie
with Holland, which guarantees the team will advance in the
international soccer tournament.
	   ``The next team we play is going to eat Mexican chili! We're
spiced up!'' gloated Enrique Robles, celebrating at Mexico City's
Independence monument with his hair painted red, green and white.
	   Even the normally retiring wife of President Ernesto Zedillo
made a televised phone call to congratulate the Mexican team.
	   ``Give the players a hug on behalf of all Mexicans,'' Nilda
Patricia Zedillo told Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente in a telephone
call to France.
	   Lapuente said: ``This is a holiday. Why not go out in the
streets to celebrate? But do it the right way.''
	   In the past, rowdy Mexico City celebrations have ended in
arrests and damages, with fans hurling rocks and soda cans at
police. About 20 people were detained for disturbing the peace
Thursday.
	   During the phone call with his wife, Zedillo called Mexico's
come-from-behind tie ``an example for all Mexicans.''
	   ``We should all act with that same character, conviction and
force,'' he said.
	   To the sounds of an impromptu salsa band, teen-agers stretched
volleyball nets across Mexico City's main boulevard, which was
closed to traffic. Revelers roared by on motorcycles waving large
Mexican flags, while others ran celebratory laps around the
angel-topped Independence monument.
	   ``I feel very, very proud,'' 9-year-old Araceli Robles Martinez
said, smiling through her face paint and tightly gripping her
little brother's hand as her father danced.
	   But others were more realistic about the Mexican team's narrow
qualification and chances for advancing to the quarter finals in
France.
	   ``We'll do well, as long as the (team) doesn't get nervous,''
said Gerson Gonzalez, a 21-year-old vocational-school student.
	   ``I'll be satisfied if we just get to the semi-finals,''
48-year-old carpenter Eliseo Betancourt said.

Kuwait journalists call for canceling prison sentence against editor accused of insulting Islam 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwaiti journalists have called on the government
to annul a 6-month prison sentence against an editor convicted of
insulting Islam.
	   The Kuwait Journalists Association also urged the government to
amend the law on publications to make it compatible with the
country's ``democratic atmosphere,'' the professional union said in
a statement issued Wednesday night.
	   A court sentenced the editor of the opposition newspaper,
al-Qabas, and a freelance Egyptian journalist to six months in jail
on Wednesday for publishing a cartoon deemed to have insulted
Islam.
	   The cartoon, published Jan. 5 on the entertainment page, showed
a teacher asking his students, ``why did God kick out Adam and Eve
from heaven?'' A student answers: ``Because they hadn't paid the
rent.''
	   The editor, Mohammed Jassim al-Saqar, defended the cartoon,
saying ``it was only a joke.''
	   It was the first time an editor was sentenced to jail in Kuwait,
which has one of the freest media in the region. The freelancer,
Ibrahim Marzouk, who filed the cartoon from Egypt, was sentenced in
absentia.
	   Al-Saqar and Marzouk were prosecuted after Islamist legislators
complained to the Information Ministry.
	   In its statement, the journalists association called on the
government to ``cancel'' the prison sentence and added: ``It is
necessary to carry out fundamental amendments to the publication
law so that it suits the democratic atmosphere and general freedom
that Kuwait enjoys.''
	   A group of liberal intellectuals and legislators, the Kuwaiti
Democratic Platform,also criticized the sentence.
	   ``We express our fear that this verdict will set a precedent in
imprisoning journalists and writers as if they were criminals or
corrupt persons who deserve harsh punishment,'' it said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A balcony holding more than 100 spectators, mostly
children, collapsed Thursday onto the crowded floor of a sports
stadium in southern Russia, killing 22 people, officials said.
Thirty-nine others were injured.
	   ``People started screaming,'' said Vladimir Sherbakov, a local
sports journalist who was covering the opening ceremony of a
wrestling tournament in the stadium. ``There was panic, but
everybody's first reaction was shock.''
	   The accident occurred at about 11:40 a.m. (0740 GMT) at the
start of a Russian National Freestyle Wrestling Competition, when a
50-meter-long (160-foot-long) concrete balcony fell about 5 meters
(16 feet) onto the spectators underneath.
	   Immediately after the balcony collapsed, wrestlers and some of
the estimated 2,500 people in the audience rushed to help those
trapped under the balcony.
	   ``Within 10 minutes the wrestlers had lifted the fallen pieces
off and freed the people underneath,'' Sherbakov said.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in the southern city of Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers
(850 miles) south of Moscow in the Kabardino-Balkaraya republic.
	   According to Sherbakov, the stadium was in poor condition.
Construction on the complex began 15 years ago, but the complex,
designed for track and field events, was not finished until 1994
because of funding problems.
	   ``It could have collapsed because of poor construction, but
there were also too many people on the balcony,'' he said.
	   Sherbakov described the balcony as a standing room only area
where non-paying spectators could watch the event. As a result,
most of those on the balcony were children who couldn't afford
tickets, he said.
	   The event, he said, was ``very big for our city and our
republic, with participants from all around Russia. There were lots
of people there.''
	   Alexander Khashkhovov, assistant to Kabardino-Balkaraya
president Valery Kokov, said the collapse occurred because the
stadium was old. But NTV television said local police believe that
negligence in the construction process may have been responsible.
	   A criminal investigation has been opened into the incident.
	   Shoddy construction and poor maintenance are endemic in Russia,
where funds for construction and repair of public buildings have
all but disappeared since the Soviet collapse.

New items on Roberto Baggio saying defenders too physical, Bergomi predicting Brazil-France finals, Celso Ayala and fastest goal, Iranian punished over logos, French athletes volunteer for World Cup, British soccer gamblers back striker Michael Owens. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Roberto Baggio says he sees no change in
the physical play of defenders at the World Cup, despite new rules
intended to protect forwards.
	   ``Defenders are as tough as in the World Cup editions of 1990
and 1994,'' said the 31-year-old striker, who's playing in his
third World Cup with Italy.
	   ``I see no improvement for the forwards and rough tackles still
are carried,'' Baggio said. ``I got kicked as usual.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SENLIS, Italy (AP) _ Italy's veteran sweeper Giuseppe Bergomi
said he considered Brazil and home team France as the favored teams
for the 1998 World Cup title.
	   ``Italy comes just behind them, along with Germany and
Argentina,'' the 34-year-old defender said.
	   Bergomi, a teammate of the Brazilian star Ronaldo with Inter
Milan, said the young striker ``has more scoring chances with Inter
because we play more defensively and he has more room for his
unstoppable raids. With the more offensive Brazil he's somewhat
compressed in front.''
	   ``Ronaldo is one of the greatest world players. We will see the
true Ronaldo in the next matches if he's fit,'' Bergomi said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _The fastest goal of the World Cup helped get
Paraguay into the second round and put Celso Ayala in line for a
gold watch.
	   Ayala's header at 52 seconds against Nigeria Wednesday was the
fastest goal of the tournament and the fourth-fastest in Cup
history, FIFA said.
	   Vaclav Masek scored for Czechoslovakia 15 seconds into a match
against Mexico in 1962, Bryan Robson of England had one at 27
seconds of a 1982 match against France and Frenchman Bernard
Lacombe scored in 37 seconds into a 1978 match against Italy.
	   FIFA gives a gold Swiss watch to the player who scores the
fastest goal of the tournament.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ An Iranian player found out Thursday that you can
take sponsor promotion too far.
	   Goalie Ahmad Abedzadeh was fined dlrs 5,000 for having two sets
of manufacturers' logos on his gloves during Sunday's 2-1 victory
over the United States. FIFA rules allow just one emblem on the
gloves.
	   The companies involved were not disclosed.
	   FIFA warned that Abedzadeh faced heavier penalties if he wore
the gloves again.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two former Olympic athletes who starred for
France's top track club more than 30 years ago are working as
volunteers at World Cup games in Paris.
	   Constantin Lissenko and Claude Piquemal first met at the Racing
Club de France before their Olympic appearances _ Lissenko in the
100 meters at Rome in 1960, Piquemal in the 400-meter relays at
Tokyo in 1964 and Mexico City in 1968.
	   Lissenko was the volunteer recruiter at Parc des Princes when he
came across the file of his old friend, and he is making good use
of Piquemal's specific talents. He gave him the task of getting the
lineups to journalists at the stadium as quickly as possible before
the start of the game.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON _ Teenage striker Michael Owen has replaced England
captain Alan Shearer as the most heavily backed player to score the
first goal in Friday's World Cup game against Colombia.
	   Graham Sharpe, spokesman for British bookmaker William Hill,
said in recent years soccer gamblers had relied on Alan Shearer to
score England's first goal to make them a quick profit.
	   ``But now we are seeing tremendous interest in Michael Owen at
odds of 9-2 against Colombia,'' he said.
	   Shearer (3-1) was still favorite to score the first goal
according to the odds but more people are putting money on Owen,
who is also rated a 14-1 chance to score three goals.
	   Hill's is offering odds of 4-5 for England to beat Colombia, 1-6
to progress to the next round and 14-1 to win the World Cup.

Agassi, Moya are latest upset victims AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: TOPS with Agassi defeat
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Andre Agassi, hurt by double faults
and disputed line calls, became the eighth men's seed eliminated at
Wimbledon when he lost in four sets Thursday to Germany's Tommy
Haas.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13 seed, trailed by two sets
to one when the second-round match was suspended by darkness
Wednesday. Haas won the fourth set Thursday to close out the match
4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4.
	   Haas, 20, has been billed as Germany's successor to Boris
Becker. He is a product of the Nick Bollettieri academy in Florida,
where Agassi also got his start.
	   ``I used to see him practice there,'' Haas said. ``I used to sit
on the sideline when he was playing. ... This is a very special win
for me. I can say I beat Andre Agassi, a former No. 1 who won a
couple of Grand Slams.''
	   Earlier, No. 5 seed Carlos Moya, the French Open champion, was
ousted in four sets by Morocco's Hicham Arazi. In a Centre Court
match between two players more acccomplished on clay than grass,
Arazi rallied to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.
	   The exits of Agassi and Moya mean that half of the 16 men's
seeds have been ousted in the first two rounds.
	   The others are No. 2 Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg Rusedski, No. 7
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 8 Cedric Pioline, No. 10 Alex Corretja and
No. 15 Karol Kucera.
	   Agassi broke in the first game of the fourth set and held for a
2-0 lead. But he double faulted on break point in the sixth game to
let Haas even the set at 3-3.
	   The two remained on serve until the 10th game when another
double fault by Agassi gave Haas a match point. Agassi saved that
one, but Haas converted his second match point with a forehand
return.
	   In the final game, leading 40-30, Agassi was upset when at least
one groundstroke by Haas appeared to land long but drew no call. He
approached chair umpire John Frame, who refused to make an
overrule.
	   Agassi had been furious with Frame over another line call
Wednesday that helped Haas win the third set.
	   A forehand by Haas was ruled good, even though replays showed it
was clearly out.
	   ``It was nearly six inches (out),'' Agassi protested. ``It was
out both ways. It was wide and it was long.''
	   Frame shook his head and the call stood, giving Haas a 6-3 lead
in the tiebreaker. Agassi saved one set point, but succumbed on the
next.
	   Play was then suspended, and Agassi resumed his protest.
	   ``In 12 years, I've never seen it miss that much,'' he said to
Frame.
	   The Centre Court crowd jeered the umpire and linesmen as they
left the court.
	   On Thursday, Haas acknowledged the ball had been out.
	   Of all the Spanish clay-court experts, Moya was considered the
player with the best all-around game and the best chance of
excelling at Wimbledon.
	   But he was thoroughly outplayed by Arazi, a clay-court master
who reached the French Open quarterfinals the last two years. The
French-based lefthander is considered one of the best shotmakers in
the game.
	   But the match, delayed twice by rain, never lived up to
expectations.
	   ``It wasn't a great match,'' Arazi said. ``I don't think we
played good tennis. It's not easy to play here on grass. It takes
time to get used to it. He was playing better than me in the
beginning, but after the rain, he started to make a lot of
mistakes.''
	   Jennifer Capriati, who won her first Grand Slam match in five
years Wednesday, couldn't keep up the momentum as she lost 4-6,
6-4, 6-2 to fellow American wild card Lori McNeil.
	   Martina Hingis hardly looked like a Wimbledon champion as she
struggled to a 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 victory over Elena Makarova, a
Russian ranked 79th in the world.
	   ``I made it tough on myself,'' Hingis said. ``It wasn't an
outstanding performance, I must say. Maybe tomorrow's a better
day.''
	   Lisa Raymond, who lost to Hingis in a tight, first-round match,
had said the Swiss teen-ager was ``vulnerable'' to an upset. And
that seemed true Wednesday, with Hingis facing a player who had won
only four matches all year.
	   When the match started after a half-hour rain delay, Hingis made
uncharacteristic unforced errors and seemed to rush her shots.
	   ``I was a little bit surprised by the way she played,'' Hingis
said. ``She served very well, played very fast. I tried to force it
more and more and made more and more mistakes.''
	   Makharova was poised to win the first set when she broke for a
5-4 lead. But the Russian double faulted to lose serve, then Hingis
held at love in the next game and dominated the tiebreaker.
	   Play was stopped because of showers at the start of the second
set. When the match resumed 30 minutes later, Hingis raced out to a
4-1 lead. But she faltered again as Makarova won three straight
games to tie the set at 4-4.
	   When Makarova broke in the eighth game, Hingis slammed the grass
with her racket and grimaced in anger. Hingis broke back in the
next game and then served out the match, closing with a backhand
winner.
	   Hingis, who last year at 16 became the youngest woman in 110
years to win Wimbledon, suspects it will be tougher to repeat.
	   ``Last year I didn't really expect myself doing so well,'' she
said. ``Now, because I know I can play on grass, there's probably a
little more pressure on myself. I want to do really well and
sometimes it doesn't work that well.''

Diplomats continue to leave Belarus in protest 
</HEADLINE>
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The Polish ambassador was the latest
member of the diplomatic community to leave Belarus to protest a
housing dispute, while Russia's communist leader praised Belarusian
President Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday for standing up to
western pressure.
	   Lukashenko's government has been trying for weeks to oust
ambassadors from their homes on the wooded outskirts of Minsk,
contending that the houses need urgent sewer and plumbing repairs.
	   If that's not reason enough for the evictions, Lukashenko says
the compound belongs to him.
	   Diplomats from the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Greece, Italy and Japan left Belarus earlier this week to consult
with their governments over the dispute. Polish Ambassador Mariusz
Maszkiewicz left on Thursday, and Bulgarian Ambassador Marko
Ganchev is set to leave on Friday.
	   With the number of diplomats left in the compound dwindling,
Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov gave Lukashenko a
comradely salute for his steadfastness, and blamed the dispute on
western attempts to pump up a Cold War mood.
	   ``The scandal was cooked up by those who do not want the union
of Russia and Belarus to consolidate and are trying to weaken one
country and make the other look bad,'' Zyuganov was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   ``The difference is that in the case of Belarus, the diplomatic
factor was used, while in the case of Russia, which is doing what
the International Monetary Fund is telling it to do, it is the
economic factor,'' Zyuganov said, according to Interfax.
	   Russia and Belarus signed a union agreement in April 1997 to
ensure closer economic, political and military ties between the two
former Soviet republics.
	   The deal stopped short of Lukashenko's goal: a full merger of
the two Slavic neighbors.

Canadian government urged to cut taxes to curb brain drain to U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
By DAVID CRARY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Canada is under increasing pressure to cut taxes
in order to stem the flow of Canadians _ many with high-tech skills
_ to better-paying, lower-taxed jobs in the United States.
	   There has been a Canada-to-U.S. brain drain for many years, but
it has accelerated recently as U.S. high-tech companies recruit
more aggressively north of the border.
	   Moreover, the issue of tax cuts has become more sensitive for
the Liberal Party government this year. It has finally eliminated
the budget deficit, after five years of painful cutbacks, and can
no longer say that tax cuts are out of the question.
	   The leader of the main opposition faction in Parliament, Preston
Manning of the right-wing Reform Party, has decided to make the
brain drain a cornerstone of his latest push for tax cuts.
	   He released a Reform Party study on Wednesday asserting that
more than 660,000 Canadians now work south of the border. It said
the number of Canadians seeking temporary work visas in the United
States increased to 46,574 in 1996 from 19,378 in 1989.
	   ``It's time the Liberals woke up to the fact that this country
is losing a generation thanks to their high-tax policies,'' Manning
said. ``We can't continue to let our biggest competitor lure away
our top draft picks.''
	   Taxes in Canada vary from province to province, but the top tax
rate _ combining federal and provincial taxes _ is generally close
to 50 percent. Significantly lower taxes in the United States,
combined with higher salaries, provide recruiters with effective
ammunition.
	   U.S. tax rates vary widely by state, but it is common for
Canadians to pay 50 percent higher more of their income in taxes
than Americans.
	   Finance Minister Paul Martin, considered the top contender to
succeed Jean Chretien as Liberal Party leader and prime minister,
has thus far balked at major tax cuts.
	   He says the government will use 50 percent of future budget
surpluses for social programs, while the rest will be divided
between tax relief and reduction of the federal debt.
	   Reform has proposed spending 50 percent of any surplus on debt
reduction and 50 percent on tax relief.
	   Pleas for tax cuts also have come from high-tech executives.
	   ``We lose a lot of our scientists to the United States and we
don't succeed in attracting foreign researchers here,'' said
Francesco Bellini, chief executive of leading pharmaceutical firm
BioChem Pharma.
	   Bellini said he had supported the government's focus on deficit
reduction, but urged it to make tax relief the next priority so
corporations could spend more on research.
	   ``Otherwise, we're going to see certain research and development
activities move to countries that don't face this problem, such as
the United States,'' he said.
	   Help-wanted ads placed by U.S. high-tech firms appear regularly
in Canadian newspapers, and U.S. recruiters flock to high-tech job
fairs in Canada with offers of salaries and perks that Canadian
firms generally won't match.
	   ``The raiding that's going on is just crazy,'' said Shirley-Ann
George, executive director of the Canadian Advanced Technology
Association. ``Americans have found that Canada is a ripe picking
ground.''
	   The recruiters' targets include both experienced workers and new
graduates. U.S. software giant Microsoft has become the top
destination for computer science graduates from the University of
Waterloo in southwestern Ontario, the leading Canadian school in
the field.

Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with dissidents, McCurry comment;
picks up 5th graf 8th Ld, Clinton spoke ...
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ Welcomed with ancient pageantry, U.S.
President Bill Clinton began his journey through China with a
declaration Thursday that commitment to human dignity and freedom
is as ``vital to the strength and success'' of this nation as it is
in America.
	   Clinton came to pursue at the summit, at village roundtables,
with communists and with stockbrokers the East-West relationship he
calls crucial to peace and stability in the 21st century.
	   He had said he would be striving for the advancement of
political and human rights, an issue rankling a Congress divided
over his policy of cordial engagement and investigating his prior
deals with Beijing.
	   Thus, the extravagant ceremonial welcome at the South Gate of
the Old City of Xi'an opened a presidential mission disputed at
home. Even the sendoff was marred by formal diplomatic protest
after China revoked visas to bar three reporters for Radio Free
Asia, a U.S. government broadcaster nettlesome to Beijing.
	   In a display of China's hard line against pro-democracy
activists, police arrested three dissidents even as Clinton
arrived.
	   ``We are very concerned by the reports that some dissidents may
have encountered difficulties and some may have even been
detained,'' White House spokesman Mike McCurry said. He said
Ambassador James Sasser will raise the issue Friday in Beijing.
	   Clinton spoke first of U.S.-China accord, not discord. ``We
Americans admire your accomplishments, your economy, your hard work
and vision, your efforts against hunger and poverty, your work with
us on peace and stability in Korea and South Asia,'' Clinton said.
	   Then the polite lecture:
	   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' he told a throng in the old city. ``In this global
information age, where both economic growth and equal opportunity
are based on ideas, a commitment to providing all human beings the
opportunity to develop their full potential is vital to the
strength and success of the new China as well.''
	   As for the critics, Clinton said: ``There may be those here and
back in America who wonder whether closer ties and deeper
friendship between China and America are good.''
	   ``Clearly, the answer is yes,'' he said. ``We have a powerful
ability to help each other grow.''
	   Clinton delighted the crowd by opening his speech with a few
words of Chinese: ``Ni, hao ma?'' _ which means ``Hello, how are
you?'' He closed by saying ``Thank you'' in Chinese.
	   Air Force One landed in the murky dusk of a city shrouded by
chronic smog. At the formal welcoming rites, giant red-globe
lanterns reflected in the floodlights along the 200-yard, broad red
carpet that was Clinton's path to his greeting.
	   It was a rainbow scene of gowns, costumes, elaborate headdresses
of dynasties long past, of customed as warriors parading to bow to
the president, of dancers waving banners and scarlet globes on
lofty staffs, all amid the music of gongs, flutes and drums.
	   The pageant was styled an ``emperor's welcome,'' after rituals
dating from the 7th century rulers of imperial China. Xi'an Mayor
Feng Xichu presented Clinton the ceremonial gold key to the city.
	   But there was no easing the controversy, as a congressional
committee in Washington heard testimony on alleged leaks of U.S.
missile technology to China, while a Beijing official defended the
satellite deals involved.
	   The foreign ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said Wednesday
that cooperation on satellite launches ``benefits both sides. Those
who are in the mainstream of bilateral relations should have a
correct view.''
	   Tang dismissed U.S. investigations as ``a wave of noise in the
United States that is intended to obstruct the development of
bilateral relations with the United States. We believe it by no
means represents the attitude of most American people.''
	   Clinton views his nine-day mission to China, the first by an
American president since George Bush's in February 1989, as the
right way to increase America's impact on human rights, nuclear
weapons spread and efforts to stabilize shaken Asian economies.
	   ``Even in our differences, meeting with them ... face to face is
the best way to advance our ideals and our values,'' Clinton said
at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, where his plane stopped to
refuel.
	   ``Over time, the more we bring China into the world, the more
the world will bring freedom to China,'' he told about 4,000 people
who turned out to see him on his way.
	   But even as Clinton flew to China, Chinese police arrested two
dissidents in a display of Beijing's hard line against
pro-democracy activists.
	   The gritty industrial city surrounding Xi'an was primped,
painted and flag-decked for Clinton's arrival.
	   On Friday, Clinton goes to the village of Xia He for what is
billed as a roundtable discussion with ordinary Chinese citizens
about their lives in a changing society. He'll speak in the village
square. Then Clinton, his wife, Hillary, and daughter, Chelsea, are
tourists for an afternoon, visiting the unearthed terra cotta
warriors, pottery soldiers fashioned to guard an emperor in the
afterlife.
	   Then to Beijing on Saturday, opening with the event that has
stirred the greatest controversy at home: a formal welcoming in
Tiananmen Square, scene of the democracy demonstrations bloodily
repressed by Chinese troops in June 1989.
	   Clinton defends his decision to go to that symbolic site as
protocol, not substance, and said he will speak America's piece for
human rights and freedom. But not there; no speeches at Tiananmen.

New law sets sentences for pedophiles 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In a bid to crack down on the growing
number of foreign pedophiles, legislators voted for a new law
Thursday setting sentences of up to seven years for anyone
convicted of having sex with minors.
	   The new law, which makes it a crime to have sex with a child
under the age of 14, was approved by the lower chamber of deputies.
	   A person such as a doctor or teacher who is responsible for the
welfare of a youngster up to 18 years old can be sentenced to seven
years in prison if they abuse their position in order to obtain
sexual favors.
	   Pedophilia has become a major problem in Romania in recent
years. Foreign pedophiles have been attracted by the thousands of
homeless and poor children who are easy prey.
	   A trial of an Anglican priest from Britain who recently admitted
having sex with two 13-year-old runaway boys is currently under
way.
	   The new law still needs to be approved by parliament's upper
chamber.
	   Up until now, the country has had no specific laws punishing
those who sexually abuse children.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A powerful explosion rocked an apartment building
in eastern Paris Thursday, killing two people, and seriously
injuring another, police said.
	   The explosion occurred inside a three-story building opposite
the Sainte-Ambroise church in the Bastille neighborhood, police
officials, who requested anonymity, said.
	   Police cordoned off the area. The cause of the explosion, which
took place at about 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT), was not immediately
known, the officials said.
	   One man and a woman, both in the second floor of the building at
the time of the blast, died, police said.
	   The explosion sparked fires in the building, which was
immediately evacuated. Firemen extinguished the flames.

U.S. syphilis rate hits record low 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Hold for release at 2000 GMT.
By RUSS BYNUM
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The syphilis rate in the United States has
plummeted 84 percent since 1990 to the lowest level on record,
putting health officials within striking distance of stamping out
the sexually transmitted disease.
	   The rate of new cases in 1997 was 3.2 for every 100,000 people,
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported
Thursday. That is the lowest level since health officials started
tracking the disease in 1941.
	   ``This tells us that we have a unique opportunity to eliminate
syphilis,'' said Dr. Lyn Finelli, a CDC epidemiologist.
	   Syphilis reached epidemic proportions in the United States in
1986 and peaked in 1990 at 20.3 cases per 100,000. Rates have been
declining since then, in part because of increased funding for
treatment, Finelli said.
	   Changes in sexual behavior to avoid AIDS _ such as using condoms
and having fewer sex partners _ have also reduced syphilis, she
said.
	   The number of new cases per year dropped 83 percent between 1990
and 1997, from 50,578 cases to 8,551.
	   Maryland had the highest rate at 17.6 per 100,000, followed by
Mississippi at 14.4 and Tennessee at 14. Five states reported no
syphilis cases _ Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Vermont and
Wyoming.
	   The 16 Southern states had a 1997 syphilis rate of 6.6 per
100,000 _ more than double the national rate. One possible reason
is the limited availability of medical care in the region's rural
areas, Finelli said.
	   Blacks were infected at a substantially higher rate than other
ethnic groups. Twenty-two of every 100,000 blacks contracted
syphilis, compared with 0.5 of every 100,000 whites and 1.6 per
100,000 Hispanics.
	   ``It may be because blacks are poorer and they have less access
to health care,'' Finelli said.
	   Syphilis first appears as a painless sore, then causes rashes
and lesions. It can be cured with antibiotics, but if left
untreated can lead to degeneration of bones, the heart and the
nervous system.
	   The previous low was in 1957, when the U.S. rate was 3.9 cases
per 100,000.

World Cup: Spain adds new chapter in country's underachievement 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ If awards for disappointment are ever
issued, Spain better find a gigantic trophy case.
	   The Iberian crew wrote probably the most spectacular chapter in
the national team's history of underachievement Wednesday night,
scoring a tournament high number of goals in a 6-1 thrashing of
Bulgaria and still getting ousted from the competition.
	   The victory and subsequent elimination brought tears to many
Spanish fans. Despite the victory, the final Group D games saw
Nigeria and Pargaguay advance but sent Spain home with its earliest
exit since 1978.
	   For other Spanish, it was only more expected disillusionment,
albeit more dramatic than usual.
	   One of the world's perennial powers, analysts have long been
puzzled as to why Spain has never achieved the pedigree along the
likes of Brazil, Italy, Germany or Argentina.
	   Despite always mentioned as a contender, its only major title
was the 1964 European Championship.
	   It has, however, missed out narrowly on several occasions.
	   It was eliminated in the 1994 World Cup quarterfinals by
eventual finalist Italy in a game all agreed it deserved to win.
	   Then in the 1996 European Championship, it swamped host England
with superior style and speed only to go out in the quarterfinals
on penalties.
	   Coach Javier Clemente had said that in previous years Spain
lacked a serious striker, but this year he had internationally
acclaimed Raul Gonzalez, Luis Enrique and Fernando Morientes.
	   This time the 48-year-old Basque attributed the stumble to
misfortune.
	   ``We gave it all we could; luck was just not with us,'' he said
after the Bulgarian loss, offering what has come to be almost a
stock response for the Spaniards.
	   Dutch legend Johan Cruyff believes Spain was punished for
underestimating its opponents.
	   ``Spain's situation is no disappointment. It never does anything
in the World Cup anyway,'' he added earlier in the week as
elimination loomed.
	   His comment touched on what many feel may be the crux of the
matter: Nobody expects Spain to go far because the team itself
doesn't.
	   ``We're going out with our heads high because although we didn't
go through. We fought to the end on the pitch,'' said defender
Miguel Angel Nadal, who looked relaxed Thursday just when many
expected him to be bitterly disappointed.
	   Spain came into its sixth consecutive World Cup finals riding
high expectations after losing only one game since the 1994
tournament.
	   It admitted it had a tough group with Nigeria, Paraguay and
Bulgaria, but never for a moment doubted its ability to reach the
second round.
	   Some believe Clemente failed to respond adequately after it's
opening 3-2 sting by Nigeria.
	   ``Clemente panicked after the Nigerian defeat, and so did the
team '' said Ramon Besa, a senior sports journalist with Spain's
leading daily El Pais. ``Against Paraguay, they were mentally
frazzled. They didn't know how to respond.''
	   When they did finally react against Bulgaria, it was too late.
	   Calls for Clemente's job are likely but they'll be few.
	   Players and fans know that, for all his unfilled promises, he's
still the best available and success will just have to wait.
	   ``He's a coach who went for four years without losing. Here
we've lost just one game,'' Nadal said. ``But nobody can deny his
class, and if somebody disputes it, I as a veteran player can
testify that he is the best we've had.''

Netherlands, Mexico, referee advance developments AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: NEW throughout with Thursday's early games, other
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Netherlands and Mexico advanced to the second
round of the World Cup on Thursday, and so did an American referee
whose controversial decision to award a penalty earlier this week
was vindicated by a Norwegian television replay.
	   The Dutch and the Mexicans both qualified after a 2-2 draw at
Saint-Etienne, a game decided on Luis ``El Matador'' Hernandez'
goal five minutes into second-half injury time.
	   ``I am happy. It was an unbelievable game,'' said Hernandez, who
was a doubtful starter because of an ankle injury. ``It was a
fantastic game for us. A triumph for Mexico and the Mexican
people.''
	   While it was a thrilling finish _ Mexico was 2-0 down in the
75th minute _ the Mexicans needed to win for the game to make any
difference in either team's destiny in Group E. Belgium, the third
place team, eliminated itself by drawing 1-1 with South Korea at
Paris, so the Dutch won the group ahead of Mexico on goal
differential.
	   Both teams will play second round matches Monday against
opponents that were determined later Thursday when Germany played
Iran and Yugoslavia faced the United States in the Group F
deciders.
	   Meanwhile, the chief of World Cup officiating defended his
embattled referees, including American Esse Baharmast, who awarded
the winning penalty kick to Norway in a 2-1 victory over Brazil on
Monday.
	   That result eliminated Morocco from the tournament and led to
charges Thursday from the African Football Confederation that the
continent had been victimized by ``one-sided'' refereeing and urged
FIFA to ``repair prejudice'' that resulted in the elimination of
African teams.
	   Initial replays of Baharmast's call showed contact but no clear
foul. But David Will, who runs FIFA's referee office, pointed to
photos taken from the Norwegian television network NRK that show
Brazil's Junior Baiano clearly grabbing the jersey of the Norwegian
player, Tore Andre Flo, in the penalty area.
	   ``The referee, from his angle, took a decision and played it as
he saw it, direct and straightforward,'' Will said. ``You can look
at television and photographs and pictures on the Internet. But at
the end of the day, the referee has to make a decision on the field
in a split second as he sees it.''
	   Baharmast and other referee whose call cost an African team a
chance to advance were picked Thursday for the officiating crews of
second-round World Cup games, albeit as substitutes. Baharmast and
Laszlo Vagner of Hungary, whose call nullified a crucial Cameroon
goal on Monday, could also be named as head referees for matches
later in the tournament.
	   Will said overall officiating in the Cup's first 40 games
averaged 8.3 points out of 10, and marks were getting better as the
tournament progressed. Most games were graded between 8 and 9 by
the officiating supervisors, he said.
	   ``We remain generally satisfied with the performance of the
referees,'' Will said. ``The overall standard remains high _ higher
than in the United States (in 1994), to be sure.''
	   Elsewhere, the fear of new World Cup violence was seen on the
streets of Leon, where bars closed and and schoolchildren planned
to stay home as the town prepares for Friday's England-Colombia
match.
	   Lens was hit by the World Cup's worst violence last Sunday when
German fans rampaged. A French policeman hit over the head by an
iron bar was left in a coma.
	   Fear of English soccer hooligans is running high. In addition,
many people dread a return of the Germans, who, according to
reports, might seek a confrontation Friday with the English.
	   ``You can understand their parents' fears,'' said primary school
teacher Evelyne Tumerelle, who said she was expecting said only
three of her 20 pupils to show up Friday.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
has announced alcohol restrictions. Officials banned its sale or
possession on the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Germany's Interior Ministry toughened border checks, with 1,000
border guards deployed. By noon Thursday, more than 10,000
travelers had been checked. Fourteen suspected hooligans had their
passports seized.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.' ''

Iranians hope for surprise victory against Germany in World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians pushed their sporting ambitions
sky-high Thursday night as they hoped their soccer team would
deliver a stunning surprise defeat of Germany in the World Cup.
	   Squads of teenagers took to the streets of the capital before
the match began, shouting ``IRAN'' and blowing whistles. Passing
motorists joined in the clamor, honking their horns in support of
the demanded victory.
	   An Iranian win against Germany in Montpellier, France, would
push the team into the second round of the World Cup, which has
become the national target after Iran's 2-1 triumph over the United
States on Sunday.
	   Most Iranians know that the match against Germany, the European
Champions and a team fancied to win the cup, will be more difficult
than Sunday's game, and less politically charged. But they
nevertheless believe Iran has a chance.
	   ``We have good, strong and highly motivated footballers and God
is with us, so we can create something more than a surprise. We can
be the phenomenon of the century's last World Cup,'' said Abbas
Rafaat, 26, a Tabriz university student.
	   ``I think our people now expect much more than before. The guys
must go ahead. We do not accept any excuse. We want to see them
among the world's top 16 teams,'' Majid Alizadegan, a 29-year-old
civil engineer, said.
	   While the match against the United States turned Tehran into a
ghost town before kickoff and triggered a night-long party after
the final whistle, the capital was quieter Thursday owing to its
being a national holiday.
	   For Iran to advance to the second round, it has to win the match
or draw it and hope that the United States beats Yugoslavia by two
goals, a remote possibility considering the American's record so
far.
	   ``We will play with our all capability. We do not think that
Germany is invincible, and we can beat it,'' Iran's coach, Jalal
Talebi, told the newspaper Abrar.
	   With a star-studded team and vast experience, Germany is a hot
favorite to win the match and the World Cup.
	   But Iranians have put their faith in their ability to counter
attack with speed and the relative youth of their players. The
average age of Germany's players is 31, the oldest in the
tournament.
	   As in the game against the United States, Iran will depend on
Karim Bagheri, Ali Daei and Khodadad Azizi, who all play in the
German league and know their rivals well.
	   Iran will also be fielding Mehdi Mahdavikia, who scored a goal
and set up another in the match against the Americans.
	   ``We are quite ready, morally and physically, to confront
Germany and, God willing, we will win,'' Mahdavikia told Abrar.

Spain mourns World Cup exit WITH Sports-Soccer-Spain-Exit style.

EDS: REPEATING to European lines to CORRECT slug to conform to
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Bitter victory or epic tragedy, Thursday's
headlines rammed home the futility of Spain's 6-1 trouncing of
Bulgaria that marked its departure from the 1998 World Cup.
	   And accompanying the words, the photos chosen displayed images
of desolation and pain at Spain's elimination Wednesday night from
the competition in the first round _ its worst World Cup
performance since 1978 in Argentina.
	   On the inside pages, coach Javier Clemente took much of the
blame for the national shame, hinted when Nigeria beat Spain 3-2 in
the opener and all but confirmed with a goalless draw against
Paraguay.
	   Throughout the tournament, Clemente has been criticized by the
Spanish press for arrogance, lack of refinement and being
confrontational with journalists.
	   ``Nobody is more responsible for the failure than Clemente _
that foul-spoken coach submerged in a destructive process that
ended up contaminating the players,'' leading daily El Pais said.
	   But while the coach's future at the head of the squad was in
doubt, direct calls for his dismissal were notably absent.
	   Madrid-based sports daily Marca and national newspaper El Mundo
announced a ``national debate'' on Clemente's position.
Barcelona-based sports paper El Mundo Deportivo echoed the
sentiment.
	   ``The question on the street is should Clemente go or not,'' it
wrote.
	   Despite the criticism, Clemente's impressive track record since
taking over the national squad in 1992 was not questioned and
Spain's ignominious exit from the World Cup also was treated with a
sense of fatalism.
	   Despite being one of the world's perennial powers, the last time
Spain reached the World Cup semifinals was in 1950.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A mother and her 17-year-old son died, and another
person was seriously injured, in an apartment explosion in eastern
Paris on Thursday, police said.
	   The victims were both Yugoslavs, police said.
	   The explosion occurred inside a three-story building opposite
the Sainte-Ambroise church in the Bastille neighborhood, police
officials, who requested anonymity, said.
	   Police cordoned off the area. The cause of the explosion, which
took place at about 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT), was probably domestic,
the police officials said.
	   The explosion sparked fires in the building, which was
immediately evacuated. Firemen extinguished the flames.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranians pushed their sporting ambitions
sky-high Thursday night as they hoped their soccer team would
deliver a stunning surprise defeat of Germany in the World Cup.
	   Squads of teenagers took to the streets of the capital before
the match began, shouting ``IRAN'' and blowing whistles. Passing
motorists joined in the clamor, honking their horns in support of
the demanded victory.
	   An Iranian win against Germany in Montpellier, France, would
push the team into the second round of the World Cup, which has
become the national target after Iran's 2-1 triumph over the United
States on Sunday.
	   Most Iranians know that the match against Germany, the European
Champions and three-time winners of the cup, will be more difficult
than Sunday's game, and less politically charged. But they
nevertheless believe Iran has a chance.

Agassi, Moya are latest upset victims Serena Williams AP Sports Writer

Eds: updates with Agassi quotes; victories by Krajicek, Novotna,
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Angry at the officiating and hurt by
double faults, Andre Agassi is gone from Wimbledon.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13 seed, became the eighth
men's seed eliminated when he lost in four sets Thursday to
Germany's Tommy Haas.
	   Agassi trailed two sets to one when the second-round match was
suspended because of darkness Wednesday. Haas won the fourth set
Thursday to win 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4.
	   ``I didn't deserve to win the match today,'' Agassi said. ``I
didn't do what I needed to do. Three of the first sets were
completely in my hands.''
	   It was Agassi's second early Grand Slam exit. He lost in the
first round of the French Open.
	   ``It reflects not having enough matches,'' said Agassi, who is
trying to make a full-time return to tennis after playing sparingly
in 1997. ``I need the matches. It's been a slow run right now and
it makes it difficult.''
	   Haas, 20, has been billed as Germany's successor to Boris
Becker. He is a product of the Nick Bollettieri academy in Florida,
where Agassi also got his start.
	   ``I used to see him practice there,'' Haas said. ``I used to sit
on the sideline when he was playing. ... This is a very special win
for me. I can say I beat Andre Agassi, a former No. 1 who won a
couple of Grand Slams.''
	   Earlier, No. 5 seed Carlos Moya, the French Open champion, was
ousted in four sets by Morocco's Hicham Arazi. In a Centre Court
match between two players more acccomplished on clay than grass,
Arazi rallied to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.
	   The exits of Agassi and Moya mean that half of the 16 men's
seeds have been ousted in the first two rounds.
	   The others are No. 2 Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg Rusedski, No. 7
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 8 Cedric Pioline, No. 10 Alex Corretja and
No. 15 Karol Kucera.
	   Asked who he thinks will the title, Agassi said ``Cracker
Jack,'' referring to 1996 champion Richard Krajicek. The
ninth-seeded Dutchman cruised into the third round with a
straight-set win over Romania's Dinu Pescariu.
	   Michael Chang, unseeded this year, lost in five sets to Sweden's
Magnus Gustafsson.
	   In women's play, Martina Hingis hardly looked like a Wimbledon
champion as she struggled to a 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 victory over Elena
Makarova, a Russian ranked 79th in the world.
	   ``I made it tough on myself,'' Hingis said. ``It wasn't an
outstanding performance, I must say. Maybe tomorrow's a better
day.''
	   Hingis, who last year at 16 became the youngest woman in 110
years to win Wimbledon, suspects it will be tougher to repeat.
	   ``Last year I didn't really expect myself doing so well,'' she
said. ``Now, because I know I can play on grass, there's probably a
little more pressure on myself. I want to do really well and
sometimes it doesn't work that well.''
	   Serena Williams, playing on Centre Court in only her second
Wimbledon match, crushed fellow 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic 6-3, 6-0.
	   Jennifer Capriati, who won her first Grand Slam match in five
years Wednesday, failed to keep her momentum, losing 4-6, 6-4, 6-2
to fellow American wild card Lori McNeil.
	   No. 3 Jana Novotna, a two-time finalist, advanced in three sets
over Tatiana Panova.
	   Agassi broke Haas in the first game of the fourth set and held
for a 2-0 lead. But he double faulted on break point in the sixth
game to let Haas even the set at 3-3.
	   The two remained on serve until the 10th game when another
double fault by Agassi gave Haas a match point. Agassi saved that
one, but Haas converted his second match point with a forehand
return.
	   In the final game, leading 40-30, Agassi was upset when at least
one groundstroke by Haas appeared to land long but drew no call. He
approached chair umpire John Frame, who refused to overrule.
	   Agassi had been furious with Frame over another line call
Wednesday that helped Haas win the third set.
	   A forehand by Haas was ruled good, even though replays showed it
was clearly out.
	   ``It was nearly six inches (out),'' Agassi protested. ``It was
out both ways. It was wide and it was long.''
	   Frame shook his head and the call stood, giving Haas a 6-3 lead
in the tiebreaker. Agassi saved one set point, but succumbed on the
next.
	   Play was then suspended, and Agassi resumed his protest.
	   ``In 12 years, I've never seen it miss that much,'' he said to
Frame.
	   The Centre Court crowd jeered the umpire and linesmen as they
left the court. On Thursday, Haas acknowledged the ball had been
out.
	   Of all the Spanish clay-court experts, Moya was considered the
player with the best chance of excelling at Wimbledon.
	   But he was thoroughly outplayed by Arazi, a clay-court master
who reached the French Open quarters the last two years. The
lefthander, who is based in France, is considered one of the best
shotmakers in the game.
	   But the match, delayed twice by rain, never lived up to
expectations.
	   ``It wasn't a great match,'' Arazi said. ``I don't think we
played good tennis. It's not easy to play here on grass. It takes
time to get used to it. He was playing better than me in the
beginning, but after the rain, he started to make a lot of
mistakes.''

Defeat sours Brazil's upbeat mood 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ It took just one game to throw
Brazil's harmony off-key.
	   The touted unity of the defending World Cup champions appeared
to collapse in a fusillade of gripes and finger-pointing after a
2-1 loss to Norway on Tuesday.
	   And the game didn't even mean anything for Brazil, already
qualified in first place in Group A. Imagine if it had.
	   ``We must win, always. Defeats bring bad consequences,'' summed
up midfielder Leonardo.
	   Now, as Brazil readies to face Chile in the round of 16
Saturday, the team must find a way to defuse tensions, restore
harmony and ride herd on some runaway egos.
	   Star striker Ronaldo was among the most annoyed with the team's
play _ and especially with playmaker Rivaldo. In a phone interview
with Brazilian journalists, the two-time FIFA Player of the Year
complained that the midfield was slow and that he wasn't getting
the ball enough.
	   Rivaldo implied that it was Ronaldo's own fault for not shaking
his coverage.
	   ``We wanted to feed Ronaldo, but he always had three defenders
on him,'' the FC Barcelona midfelder said. ``Better to hold the
ball than to give it away.''
	   Coach Mario Zagallo sided with Rivaldo.
	   ``Ronaldo has to move more, shake his marker, open spaces,'' he
said in an interview on the Internet. ``This business about the
ball not reaching him doesn't exist. The problem is that he's the
team's big man and he plays static. That makes marking easy.''
	   Roberto Carlos, second to Ronaldo in the Player-of-the-Year
balloting, also bridled at criticism that he isn't producing. His
World Cup play has been sharply censured by former teammate
Romario, who was cut from the squad with a calf injury and now does
TV commentary.
	   ``People ask why I don't attack more,'' said Roberto Carlos,
whose potent left-footed shot has been rarely seen. ``If I got the
ball more, I would.''
	   Like many of Brazil's big-name players, Roberto Carlos says it's
difficult adjusting to a co-starring role after being the go-to
player on his club. For Spain's Real Madrid, he has more freedom to
attack and less responsibility to defend.
	   ``There, the team plays around me,'' he said.
	   That's not bragging, just a fact. The dilemma is similar for
Denilson, Rivaldo and Giovanni _ star attackers on their clubs, now
trying to learn new roles and new defensive chores.
	   Another dissonant note came from team captain Dunga.
	   Stung by a rebuke for his aggressive on-field conduct against
Morocco and a near-fight with Bebeto, Dunga was unusually silent
against Norway. Brazil appeared to miss his leadership and looked
confused in the final minutes, when Norway scored twice.
	   ``We all noticed that Dunga was quieter, more reserved, and that
was bad,'' goalkeeper Taffarel said on the Internet. ``It's
important for him to talk a lot because he wakes the team up.''
	   Dunga said his behavior was deliberate.
	   ``I said I'd be quiet and I was quiet,'' he said. ``Sometimes,
silence is golden.''
	   The Jornal do Brasil newspaper of Rio de Janeiro chided Dunga.
	   ``A grown man of 34, sulking like a child,'' it wrote.
	   But his attitude left doubts about how his reaction against
Chile.
	   Veteran fullback Aldair spoke almost wistfully of the rapport
among players on the 1994 World Cup champions, a team with less
talent but more harmony than the current one.
	   ``It's not easy to put together a group like the one in '94,''
he said.
	   Revealing resentments on the team, Aldair said, ``can undermine
the unity of the group.''

Iranians hope for surprise victory against Germany in World Cup

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian ambitions ran sky-high Thursday
night as soccer fans hoped their team would deliver a stunning
surprise defeat of Germany in the World Cup.
	   Squads of teenagers took to the streets of the capital before
the match began, chanting and blowing whistles. Passing motorists
joined in the clamor, honking their horns in support of the
revelers.
	   An Iranian win against Germany in Montpellier, France, would
push the team into the second round of the World Cup, which has
become the national goal after Iran's 2-1 triumph over the United
States on Sunday.
	   Most Iranians know that Germany, the European Champion and a
candidate to win the cup, will be difficult to beat. But they
nevertheless believe Iran has a chance.
	   ``We have good, strong and highly motivated footballers and God
is with us, so we can create something more than a surprise. We can
be the phenomenon of the century's last World Cup,'' said Abbas
Rafaat, 26, a Tabriz university student.
	   ``I think our people now expect much more than before. The guys
must go ahead. We do not accept any excuse. We want to see them
among the world's top 16 teams,'' Majid Alizadegan, a 29-year-old
civil engineer, said.
	   While the match against the United States turned Tehran into a
ghost town before kickoff and triggered a night-long party after
the final whistle, the capital was quieter Thursday due to a
national holiday.
	   For Iran to advance to the second round, it has to win the match
or draw it and hope that the United States beats Yugoslavia by two
goals, a remote possibility considering the American record so far.

Hillary Clinton replies to letter from Belarusian women 
</HEADLINE>
By MARINA BABKINA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A group of Belarusian women received a
reply Thursday to a letter they sent to Hillary Rodham Clinton
asking her to intervene on behalf of political prisoners in the
former Soviet republic.
	   Mrs. Clinton said in her letter, delivered by a State Department
official, that the human rights situation in Belarus was cause for
concern.
	   ``But in your struggle you are not alone,'' she wrote. ``The
United States remains committed to the cause of defending human
rights in Belarus.''
	   The Belarusian women gave U.S. Ambassador Daniel Speckhard a
letter in May that said more than 1,500 people in Belarus have been
subject to political repression of some kind in the past year.
	   The letter asked Mrs. Clinton ``to give support to political
prisoners in Belarus, to political emigres and to all citizens to
defend human rights and fight for the restoration of democracy and
law in Belarus.''
	   It was signed by 11 mothers and five wives of men who were
described as having been persecuted or imprisoned for political
reasons by President Alexander Lukashenko's government.
	   Under Lukashenko's authoritarian administration, many leaders of
the nationalist opposition have been jailed, often for relatively
minor infractions during anti-government demonstrations.
	   In her reply dated June 3, Mrs. Clinton praised the women's
``courageous efforts'' in defending human rights. She encouraged
the women and their sons and husbands to ``remain strong in these
difficult times.''
	   The letter was delivered to the Belarusian women in Minsk by
Jack Segal, director of the U.S. State Department's division for
Belarus and Moldova.
	   One of the women, Lyudmila Gryaznova, welcomed Mrs. Clinton's
reply, saying it was ``colossal support'' for everyone who fights
for human rights in Belarus.
	   Gryaznova was a member of the parliament disbanded by Lukashenko
in 1996.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Beefed-up patrols of German border
guards stopped more than 10,000 travelers Thursday and detained at
least 14 suspected hooligans in their push to prevent violence at
World Cup matches in France.
	   The Interior Ministry, which announced the arrests, posted 1,000
extra border guards Wednesday as a precaution against violence
during Thursday night's game between Germany and Iran in
Montpellier, France.
	   Police checked trains en route to France as well as stopping
cars at the border. Seven of those detained were train passengers
who were carrying dangerous items. All the suspected hooligans had
their passports taken away.
	   In southern Baden-Wuertteberg state, which borders France,
police said 20 known troublemakers at soccer games were ordered to
report to police every day Germany played at the world cup.
	   State police in North-Rhine Westphalia said they visited the
homes of known hooligans to make it clear to them they are judged
troublemakers and that ``long sentences already handed down in
France,'' to some German thugs ``should be a warning.''
	   The border checks came after 180 German thugs clashed with
French police on Sunday during the Germany-Yugoslavia game. A
police officer was beaten comatose.
	   French authorities placed Markus Warnecke, 27, of Hanover, and
Steffen Karl Elschner, 26, of Braunschweig, under formal
investigation Tuesday night in connection with the beating. Formal
investigation is one step short of being charged.
	   German police said Thursday they were investigating a third
suspect in the beating, a resident of the western city of
Gelsenkirchen identified only as Andrei Z., 27.
	   Police said he has participated in soccer hooliganism since
1991. His whereabouts were unknown.

	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac on
Thursday waded into a crowd of French-speaking students in a black
township, where he was greeted by teenage screams normally saved
for rock stars.
	   Inside the Jan Jonker High School, he smiled and made notes
while listening to a student's speech in French, a language taught
for the first time in Namibian schools in 1991.
	   ``To hear a young Namibian girl here in Katutura mention the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a sign of trust and
confidence in the future,'' Chirac responded in French.
	   In 1958, when South Africa's apartheid government ruled Namibia,
30,000 black people were forcibly uprooted and moved to Katutura, a
word in the local Herero language that means ``we don't want to
live here.''
	   Chirac began a six-day tour of southern Africa on Thursday,
establishing an economic and political beachhead that is key to
France's new African policy.
	   On Friday he travels to South Africa, the dominant nation of the
region that since 1994's first all race elections has become the
anchor for new investment and economic growth in the formerly
war-torn region.
	   The tour comes less than a year after France launched major
changes in its Africa policies away from involvement in her former
West African colonies.
	   At a press conference, Chirac denied that France wants to
counterbalance increasing U.S. influence in Africa.
	   ``Contrary to the polemics I'm hearing, there is no competition
between the United States and and France in Africa. That is
completely absurd,'' he said.
	   Like U.S. President Bill Clinton when he visited Africa earlier
this year, Chirac is traveling with top business people to explore
investment and trade opportunities.
	   But Chirac emphasized that France continues to offer official
development assistance to countries that need it, while the United
States places more focus on trade and investment.
	   Chirac and Namibian president Sam Nujoma signed agreements on
health care assistance, a 35 million French francs (dlrs 6 million)
loan to Nampower, the power utility, and transportation
development.
	   The trip marks the first time a French President is visiting
Namibia, Mozambique and Angola.
	   The late President Francois Mitterrand visited South Africa soon
after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994.
	   In 1992, France established its first cultural center in Nambia.
It proved so popular it has outgrown its available space.
	   On Thursday, Chirac and Nujoma laid the cornerstone for a new
Franco-Namibian Culture Center that will also promote local ethnic
cultures.
	   At the event, a French-Namibian archeological team unveiled a
100,000 year-old partial human skull that was found by a diamond
miner at Oranjemund on the coast ten years ago.
	   The miner recently turned over the fossil that he used as a
candle holder to the joint team that was working near the mine.
	   Namibia, a country 1 1.2 times the size of France situated on
the continent's southwest Atlantic coast, was hailed as a model of
democracy when it broke away from South Africa in 1990.
	   But now the semi-arid country of 1.6 million people is edging
toward one-party rule by the South West Africa People's
Organization (SWAPO) that waged a bush war against South African
occupation.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Argentina's Carlos Menem and Russia's Boris
Yeltsin discussed joint action Thursday to reduce illegal weapons
trafficking between the two countries, a news agency reported.
	   They agreed to ``coordinate their efforts towards cutting arms,
putting them under control, and slashing military expenditures,''
the Interfax news agency reported, citing a document signed by the
two leaders.
	   Menem's trip marks the first state visit of an Argentine
president to Russia.
	   Yeltsin was ebullient about the meeting. ``I like the Argentine
president, and I have with pleasure and without any obstacles done
business with him in the past and am ready to do more,'' he said,
according to Interfax.
	   Yeltsin plans to visit Argentina in 1999, Interfax said, citing
presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   Officials from Russia and Argentina signed several other
agreements on bilateral relations, air traffic, and a program of
cultural and educational exchanges for 1998 and 1999.
	   Interior ministers from the two countries agreed to cooperate to
fight drug trafficking and economic crimes, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ The fear of new World Cup violence was
tangible on the streets of this small northern French town
Thursday, with bars closing, and schoolchildren staying home.
	   Lens, a town of about 30,000 people, was hit by the World Cup's
worst violence last Sunday when German fans rampaged. A French
policeman hit over the head by an iron bar was left in a coma.
	   On Friday, the town plays host to a match between England and
Colombia.
	   Fear of English soccer hooligans is running high. In addition,
many people dread a return of the Germans, who, according to
reports, might seek a confrontation Friday with the English.
	   At the Carnot primary school, teacher Evelyne Tumerelle said
only three of her pupils would come to school on Friday, instead of
the usual number of 20.
	   ``You can understand their parents' fears,'' Tumerelle said.
Lens authorities said each school would decide whether to advise
parents to keep their children at home.
	   At a cafe on the central Boulevard Basly, owner Edith Fourneau
said many of her clients would not venture out until the fans were
out of town. She too plans to close for the weekend.
	   ``Having the Spanish in town Wednesday night was very good, but
the fear of British hooligans just won't go away,'' she said.
	   On Thursday, no incidents were reported, and a bolstered police
force was monitoring English fans. Lens police said there was no
sign of German fans arriving.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
has announced alcohol restrictions. Officials banned its sale or
possession on the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   But Lens mayor Andre Delelis said he regretted the ban had not
been extended to surrounding towns, especially supermarkets.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As many as 10,000
ticketless English fans were expected.
	   Authorities have stepped up security around Friday's game, as
well as Thursday night's Germany-Iran clash in Montpellier,
southern France.
	   Germany's Interior Ministry toughened border checks, with 1,000
border guards deployed. By noon Thursday, more than 10,000
travelers had been checked. Fourteen suspected hooligans had their
passports seized.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.'''
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met Thursday with French
police providing security for the Germany-Iran match in
Montpellier. He expressed his government's sympathy for the French
gendarme, Daniel Nivel, who is still in a coma.
	   Iran's ambassador to Germany, Ahmad Azizi, flew to Montpellier
with Kinkel for the game, in a show of improving relations between
the two countries.

Test cricket coverage to go to the highest bidder 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Television rights to test cricket matches in
England, considered one of the ``Crown Jewels'' of British sport,
will now go to the highest bidder.
	   British culture minister Chris Smith on Thursday removed test
matches from the list of sports events reserved for terrestrial
television.
	   Free live coverage of test cricket has been considered almost a
right of armchair sports viewers in Britain and the BBC has enjoyed
a virtual monopoly on the game.
	   But subscription television providers like Rupert Murdoch's Sky
TV can now challenge for the rights to England's national game.
	   Test matches have been included on a new ``B-list'' of sporting
events, allowing subscription broadcasters to bid for exclusive
live rights.
	   Smith said he was determined to ensure terrestrial broadcasters
did get good quality access to secondary coverage even if
subscription broadcasters won the primary rights.
	   ``This is something for which the England and Wales Cricket
Board and county cricket clubs have specifically asked,'' he said.
	   ``My decision allows (cricket) more freedom to negotiate a fair
price for its flagship events.''
	   The revised ``A-list'' of events which must be made available to
free-to-air TV includes the Olympic Games, the soccer World Cup
finals and FA Cup final, the Grand National, the English Derby,
Wimbledon tennis finals, the rugby union World Cup finals and the
rugby league Challenge Cup final.

World Cup: Goalie Grodas feels right at home in Marseille AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHAN NASSTROM
<TEXT>
	   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ One of the Norwegians will have a
kind of home-field advantage in Saturday's second-round game
against Italy in Marseille.
	   Goalkeeper Frode Grodas has played three times at Stade
Velodrome since December.
	   ``It's my new home pitch,'' he said.
	   At Tottenham, Grodas was a third-choice keeper this past season
and didn't play a first-team match for the English club for over 12
months.
	   Some people may think it's strange that Espen Baardsen, who is
Norway's backup goalie, got into Tottenham's lineup while his club
backup, Grodas, got the World Cup job.
	   ``Yes, but now it's about the World Cup and I'm not thinking
about Tottenham,'' Grodas said. ``It's been a frustrating season,
but the World Cup has been my motivation. Now it feels good playing
again. Fortunately, I have a coach (Egil Olsen) here who believes
in me.''
	   Grodas, 33, was a backup in the 1994 World Cup to Erik
Thorstvedt, who also played for Tottenham. Grodas transferred to
Chelsea from Lillestrom in Norway and won the 1997 FA Cup final
against Middlesbrough, his last first-team club game.
	   Though Chelsea won that final, Grodas fell behind Ed de Goey and
Dimitri Kharine in the Stamford Bridge pecking order. In midseason
he was sold to Tottenham, but couldn't displace Baardsen and Ian
Walker.
	   ``Winning the FA Cup final was great, but beating Brazil felt
even better,'' Grodas said. ``Finally we had some luck in the World
Cup. This was probably our best performance in a match when it
really counted.''
	   Grodas, who conceded three goals against Morocco (2-2) and
Scotland (1-1) in the first two Group A games, enjoyed his best
World Cup game so far as Norway edged the defending champions 2-1
Tuesday at Stade Velodrome to clinch a second-round berth for the
first time in three World Cup appearances.
	   ``Our defense played very disciplined and I believe that's a key
against Italy too,'' Grodas said.
	   Saturday's match will be his fourth at Stade Velodrome. In
December, Grodas played the second half _ he didn't concede a goal
in 45 minutes _ for an All-Star team during the draw for France '98
in Marseille.
	   In February, Grodas let in three goals against France, but
Norway rallied from a 3-1 deficit to tie the World Cup hosts 3-3.
	   After beating Brazil for the second time in a year _ the world
champions lost a friendly 4-2 last May in the Norwegian capital of
Oslo _ Norway now is unbeaten in 17 matches.

Refs involved in controversies picked for second-round crews With Sports-Soccer-Referee Problems 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An American and a Hungarian referee involved in
controversial calls in key first-round matches were picked Thursday
for the officiating crews of second-round World Cup games.
	   Both Essie Baharmast of the United States and Laszlo Vagner of
Hungary were chosen as the fourth _ or substitute _ officials for
games this weekend.
	   Baharmast will be the sub for Sunday's France-Paraguay match at
Lens, while Vagner will fill the same role at the Italy-Norway
match in Marseille on Saturday.
	   A call by Baharmast helped Norway advance, awarding a penalty
kick that gave the Norwegians a 2-1 victory over Brazil. Initial
replays showed contact but no clear foul, but photos taken from the
Norwegian television network NRK show Junior Baiano clearly
grabbing the jersey of Norway's Tore Andre Flo in the penalty area.
	   Vagner nullified a goal that would have put Cameroon ahead of
Chile 2-1, calling Patrick Mboma for pushing off a defender.
Replays showed contact, but no clear foul. The 1-1 tie, coupled
with Italy's 2-1 victory over Austria, meant Chile advanced and
Cameroon was out.
	   Picked to referee the first four second-round games were Marc
Batta of France, for Brazil-Chile; Bernd Haynemann of Germany, for
Italy-Norway; Jose Manuel Garcia Aranda of Spain, for
Nigeria-Denmark; and Ali Mohamed Bujsaim of the United Arab
Emirates, for France-Paraguay.
	   Garcia Aranda handled the tournament's opening game, a 2-1
victory by Brazil over Scotland.

Nine arrested in anti-hashish raid at Copenhagen's hippie city 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Riot police used tear gas against a
rock-throwing mob Thursday after officers arrested nine people
during a crackdown on the sale of hashish at the city's hippie
enclave of Christiania.
	   During the 90-minute action, helmeted police with shields seized
an undisclosed amount of hashish sold openly from bazaar-like
booths at the enclave, on the grounds of a former military barracks
just east of the city center.
	   Although hashish is illegal in Denmark, police only occasionally
make raids at Christiania, which was founded in 1971 and has become
both a tourist attraction and a largely self-supporting community.
	   It is a striking remnant of the ``flower-power'' days, with
elaborate hand-crafted houses and an air of relaxed hedonism.
	   The raid occurred on the same day Denmark's largest rock
festival opened in Roskilde, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Copenhagen.
	   Many festival spectators traditionally buy hashish at
Christiania before heading for the event.

World Cup: Spanish veteran keeper says goobye to soccer 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Blamed by some for Spain's early exit
from the World Cup, veteran goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta bade
goodbye to soccer by formally confirming his retirement Thursday.
	   In a brief press conference a day after Spain suffered an
embarrassing first-round elimination from the tournament despite a
6-1 victory over Bulgaria, 36-year-old Zubizarreta made it official
one last time.
	   ``It's time to say goodbye, goodbye to football, to the
stadiums, to the seasons, the controversies, goodbye to the
tensions and ambitions,'' he said.
	   Zubizarreta has played 127 times for Spain since 1985.
Wednesday's goal by Bulgaria's Emil Kostadinov was the 100th to be
scored against him. Zubizarreta played solidly throughout the rout
of the Balkan side but the victory proved futile.
	   For the former FC Barcelona star, his fourth World Cup always
will carry some bitter memeories given the roasting he got by the
media following Spain's shocking 3-2 defeat in its opening game
against Nigeria, in which he deflected a ball into his own net to
swing the game for the Africans.
	   The defeat was a bitter blow to Spain and it failed to recover
against Paraguay, with whom it drew 0-0. And although it trounced
Bulgaria in its final group game Wednesday, the victory was not
enough to stave off elimination.
	   ``The time for playing is over, '' the Basque goalkeeper said.
``It's a moment for being proud of what I achieved, knowing that in
soccer nothing is ever given away.''
	   Earlier this year, Zubizarreta had let it be known that he
planned to put his gloves away after France.
	   He expressed special thanks to his wife, Anni, and Spanish coach
Javier Clemente, who he singled out as ``someone who has never lost
faith in me.
	   ``Thanks Javi,'' he said. ``Soccer needs you and, although we
are going through hard times, we need you.''
	   Clemente, who was blamed for not knowing how to react against
Nigeria and Paraguay, has also been long been criticized for
keeping Zubizarreta as the national team's No. 1 goalkeeper ahead
of younger players.
	   In Spain, Zubizarreta has played 622 first-division games with
Athletic Bilbao, FC Barcelona and, most recently, Valencia. He has
won several Spanish and European titles including the prized
European Champions Cup in 1992.
	   ``The bell has rung, play time is finished,'' Zubizarreta said.
``It's all over.''

US defeats Nicaragua in baseball pre-championship series 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The United States defeated Nicaragua
8-6 in a 14-inning game leading up to next month's baseball World
Championship in Italy.
	   Nicaragua's loss Wednesday night has little impact since the
team has already qualified to attend the series, which opens on
July 21 in Italy. The United States, Canada and Panama also will
advance to the championship tournament.
	   The qualification games began in Nicaragua on June 17, with 10
countries from the continent aiming to clinch one of the five open
slots to advance to Italy. The final slot will be filled by either
Venezuela or the Dominican Republic.
	   Colombia, Argentina, Mexico and Honduras have been knocked out
of the series.
	   Cuba, as the reigning champion, automatically qualified.
	   A total of 16 teams will compete in the two-week championship
series. In addition to Cuba and the five teams from the Americas,
they will be Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan, Italy, the Netherlands,
Spain, Russia, Australia and South Africa.

World Cup: Scoring when it mattered, Paraguay advances to the second round 
</HEADLINE>
By JUAN ZAMORANO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ With one of the world's best goalkeepers
guarding its net, all Paraguay needed for a respectable showing in
the World Cup was to score a few goals.
	   For after being grouped with Spain, Nigeria and Bulgaria, only
the most die-hard of fans believed the South American team to get
past the first round.
	   Even when goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert held the powerful
Bulgarians and Spaniards to scoreless ties, no one expected him to
carry the team without Paraguay actually scoring a goal or two.
	   On Wednesday, with Chilavert allowing only one goal to Group D
winner Nigeria, Paraguay scored when it mattered most: It tallied
the quickest goal of the Cup so far and advanced to the second
round with a 3-1 win.
	   ``Finally, the goals came,'', said midfielder Miguel Angel
Benitez, who scored the second goal.
	   Celso Ayala opened the scoring, surprising the Nigerians, who
started seven substitues, with a header after only 51 seconds. Jose
Saturnino Cardozo also scored.
	   ``Everybody played great. They moved the ball very well and
fought for every loose ball,'' said Chilavert.
	   ``We've got the best defense in the world and I'm very proud of
my team.''
	   Paraguay faces host France, the Group C winner, in Lens on
Sunday, the same day Nigeria plays Denmark at Saint-Denis.
	   ``Paraguay will continue to surprise in this World Cup,'' said
Cardozo, who along with Benitez had been criticised for a lack of
``calm and talent'' by head coach Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani after the
lackluster draw with Bulgaria.

Holbrooke continues negotiations in Kosovo kidnapped by KLA, Yugoslav army clash with militants killing two; ADDS information from meetings in Germany and London. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Holbrooke quotes, three Serbs reported
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to negotiate a cease-fire Thursday in Kosovo, meeting with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and demanding a pullback of government
forces in the province.
	   Aiming to head off NATO intervention in Kosovo, Holbrooke spent
several hours with Milosevic in the presidential palace for the
second time in three days.
	   The West is urging ``that security forces, the armed forces on
both sides, should dismantle the checkpoints and withdraw to ...
barracks,'' Holbrooke told reporters at a news conference for the
Yugoslav media.
	   More than 300 people have died this year in fighting between
Serb-led security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
attracted increasing support in the predominantly Albanian
province.
	   Holbrooke, who helped persuade Milosevic to sign a peace
settlement that ended the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war, has taken on a
diplomacy mission many see as a last-ditch attempt to stop the
Kosovo conflict before NATO intervenes.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo poses the most severe dangers to ...
stability in Europe,'' Holbrooke said. ``It's the Wild West down
there.''
	   On Friday, the U.S. diplomat is scheduled to meet with moderate
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in Kosovo's capital,
Pristina.
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo support independence for their
province _ an option Western and NATO officials have ruled out.
Holbrooke underscored this Thursday, saying the province must
remain within the borders of Serb-led Yugoslavia, comprised of
Serbia and Montenegro.
	   On a visit to Germany, Rugova reiterated demands for
independence, despite pressure to resume peace talks with
Milosevic.
	   Rugova said the ``climate'' was not right for talks and
intensified his appeal for NATO intervention in Kosovo, saying the
Serbs had forced about 80,000 ethnic Albanians to flee.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said NATO should try to
secure Russian support for intervention in Kosovo. ``We don't want
to attack anyone,'' he said. ``We just want to restore order on the
ground.''
	   Russia, a traditional Serb ally, opposes NATO intervention in
Kosovo and has launched a diplomatic initiative of its own to solve
the crisis.
	   Nikolai Afanasyevsky, a Russian diplomat who is also touring the
Balkans in search of a solution for Kosovo, met Holbrooke in
Belgrade on Thursday. According to Russian sources there,
Afanasyevsky was to meet Friday with Milosevic.
	   Meanwhile, speaking at the Royal Institute for International
Affairs in London, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Thursday the Albanian majority holds the key to future developments
in Kosovo.
	   ``Now in a lot of ways the ball is in the Albanians' court,''
Primakov said, adding that the question of intervention is not
simply black and white.
	   Also Thursday, Serb government officials assailed Holbrooke for
meeting with Albanian fighters and posing for photographs with them
during an inspection tour of Kosovo.
	   A hard-liner, Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj, said the meeting
proves the United States is ``training and arming the Albanian
terrorists, financially helping them, plotting and directing their
terrorist actions,'' the official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   He called for a halt to all talks on Kosovo with U.S. officials.
	   Holbrooke has dismissed any political significance to his talks
with two local Kosovo Liberation Army leaders in Junik, calling
them only unofficial meetings with armed men.
	   In reports of the latest fighting, the Serbs' Media Center said
Thursday that a Yugoslav army patrol clashed with a group of
militants trying to cross into Yugoslavia from Albania. Two
Albanian citizens were killed and six others captured. Large
quantities of weapons were seized.
	   The Media Center also said armed Albanians killed a Serb
schoolteacher in an attack late Wednesday in the village of Kijevo,
west of Pristina. Three Serbs were abducted by armed militants
south of the capital.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said Serb-led government forces fired
grenades Thursday in southwestern Kosovo, where Holbrooke visited
the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, in another sign of deterioration, armed Serb and
Albanian villagers, apparently not part of the KLA or the police,
are increasingly firing at each other in parts of Kosovo that until
recently were not engulfed in violence.

Arab League condemns Israel's plans to extend Jerusalem authority 4-6; no pickup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Arab League discussing issue with EU envoy, grafs
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Thursday condemned
Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem municipal services to West
Bank settlements, calling it an attempt to ``eliminate the Arab
identity of east Jerusalem.''
	   The 22-member league also warned in a statement that the
implementation of the plan will ``destroy the (Middle East) peace
process and put the entire area on the brink.''
	   ``This is a very dangerous decision and will have grave
consequences,'' the statement said.
	   The league meeting was called by the Palestinians to discuss the
Israeli Cabinet's decision on June 21 to extend some of Jerusalem's
municipal services to Jewish West Bank settlements.
	   Palestinians fear the step will lead to the annexation of West
Bank land and the cutting off of Arab parts of Jerusalem from other
Palestinian areas. Palestinians also want east Jerusalem to be the
capital of their would-be state.
	   Later Thursday, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
discussed Israel's move with with the European Union's envoy to the
Middle East, Miguel Moratinos.
	   Abdel-Meguid told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that he asked
Moratinos to intervene ``in order to curb the Israeli government,
whose move contradicts (U.N. Security Council) resolutions.''
	   Moratinos, who arrived in Cairo from Lebanon Thursday, told
reporters: ``The European Union rejects all unilateral measures
that contradict international law and international legitimacy,''
	   Security Council resolutions passed after the 1967 and 1973
Arab-Israeli wars call on Israel to withdraw from all territory
occupied in return for peace. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the
1967 war.
	   The league said it would ask the U.N. Security Council to
discuss the Israeli move.
	   The Israeli Cabinet has said its decision is aimed at
strengthening ties between Jewish settlements and Jerusalem.

Billie Jean King says Rios' comments were `diabolical' AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Marcelo Rios' brief, controversial
appearance at Wimbledon didn't sit well with six-time women's
champion Billie Jean King.
	   The sullen Rios, the Australian Open runner-up and No. 2 seed at
Wimbledon with a professed aversion to grass, was eliminated
Wednesday by Francisco Clavet, then ripped Wimbledon as ``just
another tournament.''
	   ``It's horrible when you see Rios in the last couple of games in
his match and he doesn't care,'' said King, a Hall of Famer and
commentator for HBO.
	   ``He was diabolical in his criticism of the tournament. He has
no appreciation of history or his heritage or the people who came
before him.''
	   Rios, who was briefly ranked No. 1 earlier this year, complained
about the officiating and transportation at Wimbledon and said
grass-court tennis is boring.
	   ``He needs to support the sport whether it's on grass, clay or
cement,'' King said. ``He needs to grow up.''
	   --- &QC; 
	   STEFFI STALKER: &LR;  Police at Wimbledon are reported keeping a
close watch on a 35-year-old Egyptian who tossed candy at Steffi
Graf on Monday after her first-round win.
	   Graf denied she knew the man, although the British tabloids
claimed he was a stalker.
	   Asked about it, Graf shrugged. ``I am not aware of that. There
was somebody who threw sweets yesterday.''
	   The Daily Mail quoted the man, identified as El Sayed Ali, as
saying, ``Steffi's the love of my life... I'm a single man and I've
never married _ there's no room for another woman in my life.''
	   The Daily Mail said police escorted him away from the Graf
match. It also showed photographs taken with the Egyptian standing
next to Graf at earlier matches.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   NEXT BECKER: &LR;  Alan Jones, one of Britain's four national squad
coaches, predicts teen-age Russian Marat Safin will be the next
Boris Becker. This despite his first-round, four-set loss to Andre
Medvedev.
	   ``The boy has everything,'' Jones said. ``He's 6-foot-4 with
great power, he's technically sound, he has a big serve, he moves
really well and he's mentally tough. He's good enough to become No.
1 in the world and if he can just get a little more grass-court
practice he could win Wimbledon next year.''
	   Safin made a big splash with wins in the French Open over Andre
Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OVA HERE: &LR;  You only have to look at the surnames ending with the
suffix ``ova'' to see the influence of eastern Europeans on women's
tennis. In the 128-women's draw at Wimbledon, 16 players had last
names that ended that way. They represented countries like the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Bulgaria and Ukraine.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ENGLAND VS. CROATIA: &LR;  Goran Ivanisevic says Croatia will whip
England if they meet in the second stage of the World Cup. ``Attack
England? I mean, the defense... is not tough to attack. It's a lot
of holes so we can sneak with out attackers.''
	   Ivanisevic said he practiced with the Croatian team last year in
Split. ``I love football, maybe I've missed only two matches till
now in the World Cup.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SERVE AND VOLLEY: &LR;  A pub near Bristol, England, has split itself
in two _ one half for fans who want to watch Wimbledon and the
other for England's World Cup fans.
	   Owner Alun Peters runs the soccer side and his wife, Jane, runs
the tennis half.
	   ``The lads certainly don't mind _ at least we can enjoy our
football without our other halves interrupting,'' Alun said.
	   ____ &QC; 
	   Odds and ends: &LR;  Jeremy Shales, 55, has been umpiring at
Wimbledon for a record 38 years. He began at 17 in qualifying
matches, missed only one year _ 1965 _ and has been in the chair
for 10 finals.
	   Britain has a rare women's player into the third round. But
Samantha Smith is doubtful after spraining an ankle in her
second-round win.
	   First and second round men's doubles were reduced to
best-of-three sets to speed up play after rain delays the first
four days.

Primakov says Iraq must admit chemical weapons if UN report true 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Updates with comments on Iraq
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Thursday that if the United Nations is correct about traces of
nerve gas found on Iraqi missile warheads, Baghdad must admit it
and destroy the weapons.
	   Russia is one of Iraq's strongest champions on the U.N. Security
Council, and had accepted Baghdad's claim that it had made
significant progress in disclosing weapons information.
	   But on Wednesday the United Nations Security Council decided to
maintain sanctions against Iraq after Richard Butler chief U.N.
weapons inspector, said U.S. Army lab tests left ``no doubt'' that
Iraq had put deadly VX nerve gas in missile warheads. Iraq has
always denied this.
	   ``If that corresponds to reality, the Iraqis should not refuse
it, since they did not use chemical weapons during the Gulf War,''
Primakov said Thursday at London's Royal Institute of International
Relations. ``If this information is true, it is in vain that
Baghdad is dismissing it. It is essential to destroy them,'' he
said, according to ITAR-Tass, the Russian news agency.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon warned of a new showdown
with the United Nations unless the Security Council accepts
Baghdad's claims and brings the sanctions to an end.
	   Iraq must destroy such weapons and disclose all details of
illegal arms programs to U.N. inspectors before the council will
lift crippling economic sanctions imposed in 1990 during the
Persian Gulf War.
	   Primakov also told reporters that ``the ball is in the
Albanians' court'' in Kosovo, and that there was no simple answer
to the issue of whether Serbian forces should be forcefully
restrained in the province.
	   Primakov said Ibrahim Rugova, the Albanian leader in Kosovo,
``does not have as much power as he did before. The extremists who
are putting a lot of pressure on him now have the power.''
	   U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, who is in Belgrade for talks with
President Slobodan Milosevic, has warned that time for a peaceful
end to the Serb crackdown against Albanians in Kosovo is running
out.
	   Asked if air strikes would be the next step if Holbrooke's
mission fails, Primakov said: ``I hope it will not fail.''

WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK: Chinese lay on emperor's greeting for Clinton With AM-Clinton-China 
</HEADLINE>
By LAURA MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's introduction
to China was a ceremony fit for an emperor.
	   Men dressed as ancient warriors and dancing women draped in
white silk and carrying glowing red lanterns greeted Clinton on his
arrival in the ancient imperial capital Xi'an for his first night
in China.
	   Young men beat drums that measured six feet. Women wearing stark
white facial powder and blood-red lipstick presented the president
and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton with bouquets of flowers and
baskets of fruit.
	   Xi'an Mayor Feng Xichu gave Clinton the ceremonial gold key to
the city. ``I believe it will bring good luck and joy to your
efforts,'' Feng said.
	   The ceremony was outside the ancient city's fortress-like South
Gate, where 40-foot-high walls were built to deter enemies. It was
the ceremonial greeting given to emperors during the Tang Dynasty
more than 1,000 years ago.
	   Clinton appeared delighted by the spectacle. He bent toward Mrs.
Clinton several times to point out feats of grace as dancers bowed
their way. His steps were cushioned by a 200-yard-long red carpet.
	   The 600-year-old South Gate, crenelated like the top of a
medieval castle, was strung with warm yellow lights.
	   Inside the compound where emperors of yore greeted visiting
guests, the president and his entourage watched children practice
calligraphy and listened to a Chinese orchestra play traditional
songs. A fish pond and neon-lighted dragons were part of the scene,
too.
	   Clinton tried his hand at a little Chinese, too. He addressed
the crowd with ``Ni, hao ma?'' That means, ``Hello, how are you?''
He closed with ``Xie xie,'' or ``Thank you.''
	   ___
	   Clinton had more than one reason to enter China through ancient
Xi'an rather than the bustling capital of Beijing.
	   Starting in Xi'an allowed a chance to combat the effects of jet
lag before meetings starting Friday with President Jiang Zemin.
China is 12 hours ahead of Washington, and even in the comfort of
Air Force One, the flight was an exhausting 16 hours.
	   Of course, there were aesthetic reasons to visit Xi'an as well.
Xi'an was the capital of imperial China for 1,100 years, the home
of iron-handed emperor Qin Shihuangdi, the ruler who unified China
_ but also had books burned and scholars buried alive.
	   The city, an industrial outpost in the north, boasts thousands
of life-sized terra cotta warriors buried in pits to guard Qin's
spirit.
	   ___
	   If being first lady is an official job, then Mrs. Clinton got a
promotion by going to China.
	   The mayor of Xi'an presented the key to the city to ``your
excellency, Mr. President and Mrs. President.''
	   The first lady planned to break away from her husband's schedule
Saturday to hold a dialogue with women in Beijing on ``challenges
and opportunities in a changing society.''
	   She also will address issues facing women and girls in visits to
a girls' school, a law center and a training center in Shanghai and
in a roundtable setting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
in Hong Kong.
	   The last time Mrs. Clinton was in China, in September 1995, she
attended a U.N. conference on the state of the world's women. In a
speech, she scolded the Chinese and other societies for denying
women equal opportunities.
	   Mrs. Clinton will attend the signing Saturday of a health
partnership between the United States and China, tour a children's
hospital in Shanghai, deliver a speech at the Shanghai Library and
visit a Shanghai synagogue.
	   Her mother, Dorothy Rodham, and daughter, Chelsea, are on the
trip as well.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An explosive device ripped through a three-story
Paris apartment on Thursday, killing a mother and her 17-year-old
son, authorities said Thursday.
	   The explosion also left another person seriously injured, police
said. The two victims were Yugoslavs. The identity of the injured
person was not immediately known.
	   George Sarre, the mayor of the Bastille neighborhood, in east
Paris, said the explosion was the result of a homemade explosive
device.
	   ``I don't know if they received a parcel, or if they were
fabricating something,'' Sarre told reporters near the scene of the
blast.
	   Previously, police had said the cause of the blast was probably
domestic.
	   The explosion occurred inside a three-story building opposite
the Sainte-Ambroise church, police officials, who requested
anonymity, said.
	   Police cordoned off the area. The explosion occurred at about
6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT).
	   The explosion sparked fires in the building, which was
immediately evacuated. Firemen extinguished the flames.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a deal with Lebanon Thursday, Israel
received the remains of its naval commando killed in south Lebanon
last year and in exchange, sent back 40 wooden coffins holding the
bodies of Shiite Muslim guerrillas.
	   The swap, brokered by the International Committee of the Red
Cross and the French government, was the largest between Israel and
Lebanon in two years.
	   Just hours before the exchange, Hezbollah detonated two bombs in
another ambush in south Lebanon, killing two Israeli soldiers and
wounding four others in on-going fighting between the sides.
	   The remains of Sgt. 1st Class, Itamar Ilya, brought from Beirut
to Israel on a French military transport plane, were identified by
an army chaplain and then placed into an Israeli flag-draped
coffin. In a brief and somber ceremony, the coffin was carried off
the aircraft by six naval commandos in white caps and placed into a
military ambulance.
	   ``It's a mitzvah (Good deed) to return him to his family, to his
country,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said just
before the flight took off from Beirut.
	   The army later loaded 40 coffins onto the same French C-160
military transport aircraft back to Beirut. ICRC delegate
Jean-Jacques Fresard, the man who negotiated the deal, traveled in
both directions with the plane.
	   ``We brought back Itamar's remains to Israel and now we will
bring back 40 dead bodies to Lebanon so people will now have a
proper burial,'' Fresard said in Tel Aviv. ``This is also going to
make a number of families extremely happy so, as a humanitarian
organization, we can only be satisfied by this,'' he said.
	   Friday, Israel will complete the deal by releasing 60 Lebanese
prisoners, an Israeli government statement said.
	   Earlier in Beirut Thursday, officials from the Amal and
Hezbollah guerrilla groups, handed over body remains in their
possession to the Lebanese Army. In a statement, Hezbollah said it
had handed over the remains of Ilya and at least two other Israeli
soldiers, which were also brought to Israel.
	   Israeli officials had no comment regarding the Hezbollah claims
of body parts belonging to two other soldiers.
	   Yaccov Perry, the former chief of Israel's Shin Bet security
agency, who worked the Israeli side of the deal described ``10
months of exhaustive negotiations,'' and said Lebanon's prime
minister had been directly involved in organizing the deal.
	   ``Our only dialogue partner was Prime Minister Rafik Hariri,''
Perry told Israel TV.
	   A successful swap might give new impetus to efforts by Israel to
engage the Beirut government in negotiations on security
arrangements for an Israeli troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
The Lebanese government has refused to do so, saying U.N.
resolutions require Israel to leave without conditions.
	   Israel's presence along a border strip of south Lebanon it
set-up in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks, has been costly.
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have vowed to oust Israel from
south Lebanon Last year, the deaths of over 100 Israeli soldiers
killed in combat or accidents related to their service in Lebanon,
resulted in growing public pressure on the government to withdraw.
	   The deaths of two more soldiers killed in a pre-dawn ambush
Thursday was likely to further calls for a solution to getting
Israel out of its Lebanon quagmire.
	   ``We are insisting on a strong security agreement with Lebanon
so that we can leave Lebanon without allowing the Hezbollah to
attack with Katyusha rockets and ground attacks,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Thursday's exchange was set in motion Wednesday when Israel
began digging up the bodies of 40 guerrillas killed in clashes in
Israel, including that of a son of Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah.
	   In Tel Aviv, an army statement said the remains of Ilya, the
naval commando killed in action in Lebanon on Sept. 5th, 1997, had
been identified. Ilya's parents were not at the airport, army
officials said. A private funeral was scheduled for Friday at the
military cemetery in Ilya's home town of Arad in the Negev desert.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With 2,000 riot police standing nearby,
thousands of fans thronged Mexico City's streets with their faces
painted in the national colors to celebrate Mexico's qualification
Thursday for the second round of the World Cup.
	   Singing ``We proved we could,'' throngs of teen-agers in Mexico
City, Monterrey and Guadalajara rejoiced about Mexico's 2-2 tie
with Holland, which guarantees the team will advance in the
international soccer tournament.
	   ``The next team we play is going to eat Mexican chili! We're
spiced up!'' gloated Enrique Robles, celebrating at Mexico City's
Independence monument with his hair painted red, green and white -
the colors of the Mexican flag.
	   Riot police with shields and officers on horseback charged down
the Paseo de la Reforma, the capital's main boulevard, to disperse
crowds of raucous fans. Some revelers responded by throwing rocks,
bottles and soft drink cans at the police.
	   At least 11 people were reported injured. One newspaper
photographer with a gash to the head was loaded onto an ambulance.
Dozens of people were arrested.
	   After the charge, police allowed the party to continue on
Reforma, which was closed to traffic. Fans danced arm in arm to a
salsa band and sang traditional Mexican songs. Revelers roared by
on motorcycles waving large Mexican flags, while others ran
celebratory laps around the angel-topped Independence monument.
	   In a televised phone call to France, President Ernesto Zedillo
congratulated the team and called its come-from-behind tie ``an
example for all Mexicans.''
	   ``We should all act with that same character, conviction and
force,'' he said.
	   Even the normally retiring first lady expressed her joy. ``Give
the players a hug on behalf of all Mexicans,'' Nilda Patricia
Zedillo told Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente.
	   Lapuente said, ``This is a holiday. Why not go out in the
streets to celebrate? But do it the right way.''
	   On Reforma boulevard, 9-year-old Araceli Robles Martinez said
she felt ``very, very proud,'' as she smiled through her face paint
and tightly gripped her little brother's hand while nearby, her
father danced.

Torrance grabs two-shot lead in French Open 
</HEADLINE>
By ALAN PAGE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   GUYANCOURT, France (AP) _ Tour veteran Sam Torrance fired a
brilliant eight-under-par first-round 64 on Thursday to take a
two-stroke lead in the dollars 800,000 French Open.
	   Torrance finished the first day two shots clear of former French
Open champion Eduardo Romero of Argentina and Spain's Pedro
Linhart, who lie joint second on 66.
	   Torrance flew into Paris by private plane Wednesday with fellow
Scot Colin Montgomerie, but their paths soon diverged.
	   Montgomerie took a laborious ten strokes more over the
6,510-meter (7,112-yard) Albatros course at the National Golf
center to slump to a two-over-par 74, and share 82nd place.
	   Meanwhile, 44-year-old Torrance, fighting for an exemption into
his 27th successive British Open, snapped up three successive
birdies to start, posting six in all, and holed a 97-meter wedge to
eagle the par-five 14th for his best round of the year.
	   ``I played lovely golf today,'' Torrance said. ``I need at least
a top three finish here to get an Open exemption.''
	   The slimmed-down, abstemious Torrance, who gave up alcohol last
September, is playing his 589th European Tour event here, in his
28th season, a record. He is ready for many more.
	   ``Stopping drinking makes me feel so much better, particularly
in the mornings,'' Torrance admitted.
	   Torrance capped his round Thursday with an unlikely birdie,
driving into rough then sending his ball onto a wooden bridge
beside the 18th.
	   ``The ball was half an inch down a crack. I could have had a
double-hit. It could have gone anywhere,'' Torrance said.
	   In fact, Torrance nipped it cleanly. The ball cleared two mounds
and ran to four meters from the pin, before the Scot drained it for
a birdie four.
	   After Romero and Linhart, French number one Jean Van de Velde
and England's John Bickerton shot 67 to share fourth place, three
shots off the pace.
	   Montgomerie ran into trouble on the lightning-fast greens,
taking 36 putts in his 74 and making only one birdie.
	   He pulled his second into a hazard at the 12th, took a penalty
drop and double-bogied. He found water at the 17th to drop another
shot.
	   ``It was an unfortunate day,'' Montgomerie said. ``I'm fine
mentally, not suffering. I just had an unlucky day. Simple as
that.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to negotiate an end to fighting in Kosovo Thursday, meeting with
Slobodan Milosevic a day after demanding the Yugoslav president's
forces leave the province.
	   Aiming to head off NATO intervention in Kosovo, Holbrooke sat
down with Milosevic in the presidential palace for several hours
for the second time in three days. Neither side commented
afterward.
	   Holbrooke also was to meet with a Russian envoy before heading
to Kosovo on Friday for talks with Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic
Albanian leader, in the separatist province's capital of Pristina.
	   The West is urging ``that security forces, the armed forces on
both sides, should dismantle the checkpoints and withdraw to ...
barracks,'' Holbrooke said.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting this year between
Serb-led security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
attracted increasing support in the predominantly Albanian province
of Serbia.
	   Holbrooke, who helped persuade Milosevic to sign a peace
settlement that ended the 3 1/2-year war in Bosnia, has taken on a
diplomacy mission many see as a last-ditch attempt to stop the
conflict before NATO intervenes. He traveled Wednesday into the
heart of the battle zone and met with ethnic Albanian militants.
	   In the turbulent province, Holbrooke declared it was time for
Serb security forces to ``get out of here.''
	   ``The situation in Kosovo poses the most severe dangers to ...
stability in Europe,'' he said. ``It's the Wild West down there.''
	   Rugova was in Bonn, Germany, on Thursday, where he reiterated
demands for Kosovo's independence despite having been urged by NATO
officials that he abandon the push and resume peace talks with
Milosevic.
	   After meeting with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Rugova
intensified his appeal for NATO intervention in Kosovo, saying the
Serbs had sent about 80,000 ethnic Albanians fleeing from their
homes.
	   Kinkel said NATO should try to secure Russian support for
intervention in Kosovo. Russia has been a longtime ally of the
Serbs. ``We don't want to attack anyone,'' he said. ``We just want
to restore order on the ground.''
	   Rugova was meeting later with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Serb government officials assailed Holbrooke for meeting with
Albanian fighters and posing for photographs with them during an
inspection tour of Kosovo.
	   A hard-liner, Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj, said the meeting
proves the United States is ``training and arming the Albanian
terrorists, financially helping them, plotting and directing their
terrorist actions,'' the official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   He called for a halt to all talks on Kosovo with U.S. officials.
	   Holbrooke has dismissed any political significance to his talks
with two local Kosovo Liberation Army leaders in Junik, calling
them only unofficial meetings with armed men.
	   In reports of the latest fighting, the Serbs' Media Center said
Thursday that a Yugoslav army patrol clashed with a group of
militants trying to cross into Yugoslavia from Albania. Two
Albanian citizens were killed and six others captured. Large
quantities of weapons were seized.
	   The center also said that armed Albanians killed a Serb
schoolteacher in an attack late Wednesday on the village of Kijevo
west of Pristina and three Serbs were abducted by armed militants
south of the capital.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said Serb-led government forces opened
grenade fire Thursday in a portion of territory in southwestern
Kosovo that Holbrooke visited the previous day.
	   In another sign of deterioration, armed Serb and Albanian
villagers, apparently not part of the KLA or the police, were
firing at each other in parts of Kosovo that until recently were
not engulfed in violence.

Raptors trade Camby to Knicks 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Marcus Camby was traded to the New York Knicks by
the Toronto Raptors on Thursday for power forward Charles Oakley in
a swap of youth for experience.
	   The Raptors also acquired center Sean Marks, selected out of
California in the second round of Wednesday night's National
Basketball Association draft, plus an undisclosed amount of cash.
	   Camby, troubled by injuries in his two years with the Raptors,
never quite lived up to their expectations when they made him the
No. 2 pick in the 1996 draft.
	   Camby averaged 12.1 points, 7.4 rebounds and a league-leading
3.65 blocks per game last season. But he played just 63 games and
was not a factor in many of those.
	   In Oakley, Toronto picked up a 34-year-old who has played in the
NBA for 13 years, his first three with the Chicago Bulls. He likes
to rebound, enjoys the inside game and thrives on physical
confrontations.
	   ``As one of the NBA's best defenders and rebounders, Charles
Oakley gives us a physical presence and mental toughness that is
unsurpassed in our league,'' said Toronto general manager Glen
Grunwald.
	   Knicks GM Ernie Grunfeld said age was a major factor in the
trade.
	   ``Marcus fills a need for us to become younger and more athletic
in the front court,'' he said. ``He led the league in blocked shots
and gives us versatility and youth. He has a tremendous up side.
	   ``This gives us more flexability, makes us more intimidating in
the defensive end and more athletic than we've been in the past.''
	   The addition of Oakley, who averaged nine points and 9.2
rebounds last year, further shored up Toronto's front-court. The
Raptors acquired 7-foot center Kevin Willis from the Houston
Rockets two weeks ago.
	   The acquisitions of Willis and Oakley allowed the Raptors to get
a finesse player _ swingman Vince Carter from North Carolina _ in
Wednesday's draft.

Clinton gives China gentle lecture on human rights AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ After a welcome in the grand style of
ancient emperors, U.S. President Bill Clinton gently lectured China
on human rights Thursday and rejected criticism of his attempt to
strengthen relations.
	   ``We have a powerful ability to help each other grow,'' he
declared.
	   Clinton's high-stakes journey through China began amid reports
of detention or harassment of several dissidents, a matter U.S.
Ambassador James Sasser planned to raise Friday with government
officials.
	   Clinton also will urge President Jiang Zemin to allow freer
political dialogue without government interference, said national
security spokesman P.J. Crowley. The White House already protested
denial of visas to three Radio Free Asia reporters.
	   Beginning a nine-day visit, Clinton was treated to an
extravagant celebration of costumed warriors and dancers cavorting
to thunderous drums among a blaze of red lanterns. The welcome was
based on Tang Dynasty traditions dating to the 7th century. Xi'an
Mayor Feng Xichu gave Clinton a ceremonial key to the city,
introducing Clinton and his wife, Hillary, as ``Mr. President and
Mrs. President.''
	   ``A new day is dawning for the Chinese people, for China's
greatness lies, as always, with its people,'' the president said.
His remarks were heard by several hundred invited guests, but tens
of thousands stood silently on the streets to glimpse Clinton's
50-car motorcade.
	   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' Clinton said. ``In this global information age, ...
a commitment to providing all human beings the opportunity to
develop their full potential is vital to the strength and success
of the new China as well.''
	   The first presidential visit since the bloody 1989 Tiananmen
Square crackdown, Clinton's trip is intended to help stabilize
U.S.-Chinese relations after years of grudging distrust. With
little expectation of breakthroughs, officials said the symbolism
of Clinton's trip is likely to outweigh the substance.
	   On Friday, Clinton was to visit Xia He, a rural village of 400
people, to talk about China's economic reforms and growing personal
freedoms. In Xia He, all citizens 18 and older can vote in village
elections.
	   The president's remarks, in a discussion with ordinary Chinese
citizens, were expected to emphasize the importance of U.S.
cooperation with China, the world's most populous country, despite
severe differences over human rights, trade, arms sales and Taiwan.
	   ``There may be those here and back in America who wonder whether
closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are
good,'' Clinton said in his Xi'an speech. ``Clearly the answer is
yes. We have a powerful ability to help each other grow. We can
learn much from each other.''
	   Clinton's trip, his first to China, spans five cities and will
expose him to a broad cross section of people, from communist
leaders to college students pressing for democratic change. The
president is to meet with religious leaders, stockbrokers and
representatives of business, the arts, law and the media.
	   His trip was preceded by angry criticism that China does not
warrant normal relations with the United States because of
political and religious persecution, censorship and authoritarian
rule. The most closely watched moment of the trip comes Saturday,
when Clinton is to stand at the edge of Tiananmen Square for a
welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of the People.
	   In a reminder of political divisions, Republican lawmakers
refused to join the congressional delegation accompanying Clinton.
A diverse group of organizations urged that he not go to Tiananmen,
contending his presence would dishonor the hundreds _ perhaps
thousands _ of people killed as military troops closed in on the
square to crush pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.
	   Clinton, promising to speak up for human rights, argued that
critics were emphasizing protocol over policy.
	   At home, congressional investigations also were looking into
allegations that China gleaned information for its missile program
from Clinton's authorization for China to launch U.S. satellites.
	   China's foreign ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said
cooperation on satellite launches ``benefits both sides. Those who
are in the mainstream of bilateral relations should have a correct
view.''
	   Clinton's trip, following Jiang's state visit to Washington last
October, is seen as an important step toward erasing the stigma of
Tiananmen and putting U.S.-Chinese relations on a more even keel.
Every country but the United States has lifted Tiananmen-related
sanctions against China, and the United States is the only nation
that does not grant China permanent most-favorable trade status.
	   Xi'an, Clinton's opening stop, was imperial China's capital but
now is a gritty industrial city of 6.5 million. It is the site of
one the most spectacular archaeological finds of the 20th century:
more than 7,000 life-size terra cotta horses and armored warriors
buried in battle formations near the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang
more than 2,000 years ago.
	   The burial of the figures on a large scale replaced the practice
of sacrificing humans and animals to accompany emperors to the
afterlife.
	   Historians say construction of the tomb took 39 years and
involved as many as 750,000 laborers. Peasants digging a well
rediscovered the tomb in 1974.
	   Clinton and his family were to tour the excavations Friday
before flying to Beijing. Besides the first lady, Clinton also is
accompanied by daughter Chelsea, home from her freshman year at
Stanford University, and Dorothy Rodham, the first lady's mother.

Ethiopian exodus still not over, community leaders say 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with arrival ceremony over, 58 immigrants
in graf, Fresh quotes from absorption minister in grafs 9-10
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The exodus of Ethiopian Jews to the
Jewish state is not complete, despite the festive welcome the
government held for the ``last'' planeload of immigrants Thursday,
community leaders said.
	   Adisso Massala, a legislator of Ethiopian origin, said some
5,000 Ethiopian Jews are still waiting to immigrate to Israel. Most
live in the remote northern city of Gondar, he said.
	   ``How can the prime minister and absorption minister throw a
joyous party when others are left behind?'' Massala said.
	   Israel should open an office in Gondar to facilitate the
immigration of Jews living there, he said.
	   The 58 new immigrants who arrived Thursday night are the last
Falashmura, or descendants of Ethiopian Jews who converted to
Christianity, who had been living in a special compound set up for
them in Addis Ababa. They are being permitted to immigrate to
Israel to be reunited with relatives already living in the Jewish
state.
	   About 60,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel, many brought to
Israel in two dramatic airlifts in 1985 and 1991.
	   Last year, the government decided to close down the Falashmura
transit camp in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and bring its
4,000 residents to Israel.
	   Most of the Falashmura are now in Israel. However, Massala said
some 100 Falashmura are being left behind in Ethiopia so their
Jewish origins can be authenticated.
	   Israeli Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein, said Thursday's
arrival of the Falashmura did not close the chapter to immigration
from Ethiopia.
	   ``There are still more Ethiopians who will come to Israel after
the camp is closed. We will not rest on our laurels,'' Edelstein
said.
	   Yossi Sturm, a spokesman for the Jewish Agency which helps bring
immigrants to Israel, said there were estimates that about 2,000
Jews still lived in remote areas of northern Ethiopia.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After months of negotiations, the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed during an ambush in southern
Lebanon last year were returned to Israel Thursday, as part of a
swap with Lebanese guerrillas.
	   In exchange, Israel was to return the remains of 40 Hezbollah
guerrillas the same day and release 60 Lebanese prisoners Friday,
the largest swap with Lebanon in two years.
	   The swap, brokered by the International Committee of the Red
Cross and the French government, was the largest between Israel and
Lebanon in two years.
	   Hours before the exchange, Hezbollah detonated two bombs in
another ambush in south Lebanon, killing two Israeli soldiers and
wounding four others in ongoing fighting between the sides.
	   The remains of Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya, brought from Beirut
to Israel on a French military transport plane, were identified by
an army chaplain and then placed into an Israeli flag-draped
coffin. In a brief and somber ceremony, the coffin was carried off
the aircraft by six naval commandos in white caps and placed into a
military ambulance.
	   ``It's a mitzvah (Good deed) to return him to his family, to his
country,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said before
the flight took off from Beirut.
	   The army later loaded 40 coffins onto the same French C-160
military transport aircraft back to Beirut. The plane then left
Israel to return to Beirut. On board was ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques
Fresard, the man who negotiated the deal and traveled in both
directions with the plane.
	   ``We brought back Itamar's remains to Israel and now we will
bring back 40 dead bodies to Lebanon so people will now have a
proper burial,'' Fresard said in Tel Aviv. ``This is also going to
make a number of families extremely happy so, as a humanitarian
organization, we can only be satisfied by this,'' he said.
	   Friday, Israel will complete the deal by releasing 60 Lebanese
prisoners, an Israeli government statement said.
	   Earlier in Beirut Thursday, officials from the Amal and
Hezbollah guerrilla groups, handed over body remains in their
possession to the Lebanese Army. In a statement, Hezbollah said it
had handed over the remains of Ilya and at least two other Israeli
soldiers, which were also brought to Israel.
	   Israeli officials had no comment regarding the Hezbollah claims
of body parts belonging to two other soldiers.
	   Yaccov Perry, the former chief of Israel's Shin Bet security
agency, who worked the Israeli side of the deal described ``10
months of exhaustive negotiations,'' and said Lebanon's prime
minister had been directly involved in organizing the deal.
	   Israel's presence along a border strip of south Lebanon it set
up in 1985 to prevent cross-border attacks has been costly.
Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have vowed to oust Israel from
south Lebanon Last year, the deaths of over 100 Israeli soldiers
were killed by combat or accidents in service in Lebanon, resulted
in growing public pressure on the government to withdraw.
	   Two more soldiers were killed in a pre-dawn ambush Thursday.

Two people dead, one injured, in Paris apartment explosion World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with witness accounts, no immediate link being made to
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An explosive device ripped through a three-story
Paris apartment on Thursday, killing a mother and her 17-year-old
son, authorities said Thursday.
	   The explosion also left another person seriously injured, police
said. The two victims were Yugoslavs. The identity of the injured
person was not immediately known.
	   George Sarre, the mayor of the Bastille neighborhood, in east
Paris, said the explosion was the result of a homemade explosive
device.
	   ``I don't know if they received a parcel, or if they were
fabricating something,'' Sarre told reporters near the scene of the
blast.
	   Four witnesses said they head a loud explosion, which was
followed by dense black smoke.
	   Authorities were making no immediate link between the blast and
the World Cup. French authorities have stepped up security around
the soccer championship, fearing possible attacks by extremists.
	   Previously, police had said the cause of the blast was probably
domestic.
	   The explosion occurred inside a three-story building opposite
the Sainte-Ambroise church, police officials, who requested
anonymity, said.
	   Police cordoned off the area. The explosion occurred at about
6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT).
	   The explosion sparked fires in the building, which was
immediately evacuated. Firemen extinguished the flames.

Report: Plane robbed by gunmen in Nigerian airport 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ An Air Afrique Boeing-727 jet was the
third passenger liner looted in the past month by armed robbers
while awaiting takeoff at Nigeria's largest international airport,
the Lagos Guardian newspaper reported on Thursday.
	   The thieves broke into the aircraft's luggage compartment and
escaped with a large quantity of baggage as the plane was awaiting
permission to take off from the Lagos international airport control
tower around 9 p.m. on Tuesday night, the Guardian said. It was not
clear where the airliner was destined.
	   There was no immediate confirmation of the report.
	   The plane's captain, who noticed the theft, sent a distress call
that went unanswered by airport officials. Security personnel on
duty later said said they were unable to capture the culprits
because their only security vehicle had been taken away for routine
maintenance.
	   In another incident last week involving an unidentified
passenger jet, landing gear worth dlrs 1 million was stripped from
while the plane was waiting to take off, the newspaper said. In
May, a Cameroon Airlines plane was robbed of its luggage after
armed thieves blocked the plane on the tarmac with a large log.
	   The robberies came despite orders from airport security
officials to shoot suspected thieves on sight.
	   Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, has a notoriously high
rate of violent crime accompanied by a breakdown of law and order
under years of military rule.

Test cricket coverage to go to the highest bidder 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Television rights to test cricket matches in
England, considered a ``Crown Jewel'' of free-to-air sports
broadcasters, will now go to the highest bidder.
	   British culture minister Chris Smith Thursday removed test
matches from the list of sports events reserved for terrestrial
television.
	   Free live coverage of test cricket has been considered almost a
right of armchair sports viewers in Britain and the BBC has enjoyed
a virtual monopoly on the game.
	   But subscription television providers like Rupert Murdoch's Sky
TV can now challenge for the rights to England's national game.
	   Test matches have been included on a new ``B-list'' of sporting
events, allowing subscription broadcasters to bid for exclusive
live rights.
	   Smith said he was determined to ensure terrestrial broadcasters
did get good quality access to secondary coverage even if
subscription broadcasters won the primary rights.
	   ``This is something for which the England and Wales Cricket
Board and county cricket clubs have specifically asked,'' he said.
	   ``My decision allows (cricket) more freedom to negotiate a fair
price for its flagship events.''
	   The revised ``A-list'' of events which must be made available to
free-to-air TV includes the Olympic Games, the soccer World Cup
finals and FA Cup final, the Grand National, the Derby, Wimbledon
tennis finals, the rugby union World Cup finals and the rugby
league Challenge Cup final.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Protesters planted bombs, smashed
automated bank machines and severed and burned telephone and
electric cables, reacting with fury Thursday to the privatization
of Puerto Rico's telephone company.
	   One homemade bomb exploded Thursday in the hands of a policeman
as he removed it from a bank in the southern coastal town of Santa
Isabel. He was hospitalized with injuries to his hands and legs,
police reported.
	   The bomb, in a flashlight, was planted at a branch of Banco
Popular, part of a consortium buying the Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
	   Police Chief Pedro Toledo said Thursday that he did not rule out
``an act of terrorism'' executed by the clandestine Los Macheteros
guerrilla group, among a minority of islanders who want
independence for this U.S. commonwealth. Los Macheteros issued a
statement last week saying the telephone workers' protest was part
of the fight for independence.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bomb.
	   The rash of sabotage started hours after Gov. Pedro Rossello on
Wednesday signed a law finalizing the dlrs 1.9 billion sale of the
company, commonly called Telefonica, to a consortium led by the
U.S. communications giant GTE Corp.
	   The deal awaits the approval of the Federal Communications
Commission, which could take months.
	   A leading trade union on the island, the General Workers'
Council, announced Friday it is closing it's account with Banco
Popular and encouraged its affiliates and their 50,000 members to
take their money out of the bank because of its participation in
the sale.
	   ``Puerto Rico is not for sale,'' said Awilda Rivera, the
council's financial secretary.
	   Fearing they will lose their jobs, Telefonica's 6,400 workers
began an indefinite strike eight days ago and began cutting
telephone cables. By Wednesday, telephone service had been cut to
345,000 of the 1.3 million customers and half the island's 750
automatic bank machines.
	   Dozens more fiber optic cables were cut overnight all over the
island, 48 in the second city of Ponce alone, police reported. In
the central mountain town of Cayey, arsonists set ablaze a
telephone switching box. Protesters burned out a telephone booth in
western Mayaguez.
	   Violent clashes with riot police have won the protesters some
sympathy and other unions have joined the strike.
	   On Thursday, the Labor Union of Nurses and Health Employees
urged its thousands of members to stop work.
	   About 6,000 of the 10,000 electricity workers and several
thousand at the water utility started a 72-hour strike Tuesday that
did not immediately affect services. Overnight, however, police
reported that saboteurs cut and burned a 15,000-volt electric cable
in Rio Piedras, a southern suburb of San Juan with hundreds of
high-rise apartments and several shopping centers.
	   Also in Rio Piedras, protesters at dawn threw a firebomb at an
electric pylon but did not cause major damage, the police said.
	   The effects of the sabotage were not immediately known.
	   Protesters wielding blunt weapons smashed four Banco Popular
automated bank machines in Bayamon suburb, police reported.
	   Unions in Puerto Rico have a history of violent strikes marked
by sabotage. In the worst instance, Teamsters set a fire at the
DuPont Plaza hotel on New Year's Eve 1986, killing 97 people and
injuring 140.

Arab League condemns Israel's plans to extend Jerusalem authority 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Thursday condemned
Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem municipal services to West
Bank settlements, calling it an attempt to ``eliminate the Arab
identity of east Jerusalem.''
	   The 22-member league also warned in a statement that the
implementation of the plan will ``destroy the (Middle East) peace
process and put the entire area on the brink.''
	   ``This is a very dangerous decision and will have grave
consequences,'' the statement said.
	   The league meeting was called by the Palestinians to discuss the
Israeli Cabinet's decision on June 21 to extend some of Jerusalem's
municipal services to Jewish West Bank settlements.
	   Palestinians fear the step will lead to the annexation of West
Bank land and the cutting off of Arab parts of Jerusalem from other
Palestinian areas. Palestinians also want east Jerusalem to be the
capital of their would-be state.
	   Later Thursday, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
discussed Israel's move with with the European Union's envoy to the
Middle East, Miguel Moratinos.
	   Abdel-Meguid told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that he asked
Moratinos to intervene ``in order to curb the Israeli government,
whose move contradicts (U.N. Security Council) resolutions.''
	   Moratinos, who arrived in Cairo from Lebanon Thursday, told
reporters: ``The European Union rejects all unilateral measures
that contradict international law and international legitimacy,''
	   Security council resolutions passed after the 1967 and 1973
Arab-Israeli wars call on Israel to withdraw from all territory
occupied in return for peace. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the
1967 war.
	   The league said it would ask the security council to discuss the
Israeli move.
	   But in Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
said such discussion would be ``unhelpful.''
	   ``Any action in the security council would be counterproductive
to the success of our discussions with the Palestinians and the
Israelis,'' Rubin said.
	   The State Department has nevertheless criticized the Israeli
extension.
	   The Israeli Cabinet has said its decision is aimed at
strengthening ties between Jewish settlements and Jerusalem.

Grains, soybeans retreat on continually changing weather forecasts 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade after weather forecasts for
major growing regions turned cooler for the next week.
	   A rally caused by fears of excessive heat ground to a halt after
the National Weather Service, in its latest 10-day forecast, again
predicted normal temperatures in Midwestern and Delta growing
regions.
	   Futures prices have seesawed in previous sessions amid
conflicting views on the weather outlook, with some forecasters
saying hot, dry weather will prevail through much of July and
others calling for normal temperatures and above-normal rainfall.
	   Corn and soybean futures also were pressured by farmer selling
of stored products, as they took advantage of recent sharp gains in
prices.
	   Wheat futures also retreated as export sales came in at
expectations, with yearly marketing figures down 16 percent from
year-ago levels.
	   Wheat for December delivery fell 4 3-4 cents to dlrs 3.15 3-4 a
bushel; December corn fell 4 1-2 cents to dlrs 2.67 1-4 a bushel;
December oats fell 3-4 cents to dlrs 1.43 1-2 a bushel; November
soybeans fell 12 1-2 cents to dlrs 6.42 a bushel.

World Cup: Early goal gives Yugoslavs 1-0 lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Slobodan Komljenovic headed in a rebound
off a free kick just over three minutes after kickoff Thursday
night and Yugoslavia led the United States 1-0 at halftime in a
World Cup match that for the second game in a row had political
overtones for the Americans.
	   It was also the second straight game the Americans dominated
possession and hit the post early only to be frustrated.
	   Frankie Hejduk sent a falling cross that got over the head of
goalkeeper Ivica Kralj and struck the far after post 24 seconds,
but the Yugoslavs cleared and absorbed several American forays in
the first 45 minutes.
	   The Yugoslav goal came on its second shot and first threatening
chance in the U.S. half. Sinisa Mihalovic blasted a curling
35-meter free kick that American goalkeeper Brad Friedel two-handed
away, but the rebound bounced to Komljenovic, who despite standing
almost on the end line headed the ball back down behind a
recovering Friedel.
	   The game meant seeding out of Group F to the Yugoslavs, who
already had qualified for the second round, but only pride to the
United States, who already had been eliminated. The Yugoslavs were
hoping for a big victory to overcome a superior goal difference to
the Germans, who were playing Iran in Montpellier.
	   The goal didn't seem to slow the Americans, who continued to
push forward and got a powerful header from the top of the box out
of Brian McBride that Kralj handled in the 15th minute.
	   Hejduk put another shot on goal with a scissors kick in the 25th
and the Americans generally created more chances than the
Yugoslavs.
	   One of Yugoslav's serious chances came in the 28th minute when
Savo Milosevic blasted a shot from the right that Friedel had to
punch away.
	   The match was being played at a time of high political tension
between the two nations. Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy to the
United Nations, was in Yugoslavia in a last-ditch attempt to end
fighting between Yugoslav security forces and ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo province.
	   The Clinton administration blames Yugoslavia's hardline
president Slobodan Milosevic for the conflict. Should the peace
effort fail, NATO could soon carry out air strikes against the
Yugoslav forces.

World Cup: Germany, Iran tied 0-0 at halftime

	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Germany's methodical precision and
Iran's swift counterattacks canceled each other out in a 0-0 first
half in their World Cup Group F finale Thursday night.
	   Iran needs a draw, and more likely a victory, to qualify for the
second round, pending the outcome of the night's other game between
Yugoslavia and the United States. If both Germany and Yugoslavia
win, those two teams will advance, and first place will be
determine by goal differential.
	   Yugoslavia led the United States 1-0 at halftime at Nantes.
	   Iran was content to play defensively, choking off any German
attack and then countering when possible. Goalkeeper Ahmad
Abedzadeh didn't have a difficult save in the half, while his
German counterpart Andreas Koepke had to dive to his right to stop
Karim Bagheri's 35-meter drive off a set play.
	   Before the game, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met with
French police providing security for the game. Kinkel also
expressed his government's sympathy for French police officer
Daniel Nivel, who was beaten into a coma by German hooligans Sunday
after the Germany-Yugoslavia game in Lens.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A concrete balcony packed with more than 100
spectators, mostly children, collapsed in a sports stadium in
southern Russia on Thursday, killing 22 people attending a
wrestling competition. Thirty-nine others were injured.
	   A huge roar resounded through the stadium when the 50-meter
(160-foot) long balcony, festooned with a red banner that said
``welcome participants of the competition,'' plunged 5 meters (16
feet) onto the crowded floor.
	   ``People started screaming,'' said Vladimir Sherbakov, a sports
reporter who was covering the Russian National Freestyle Wrestling
Competition. ``There was panic, but everybody's first reaction was
shock.''
	   A dozen people frantically scrambled off a small part of the
balcony that did not fall. TV footage showed several others hanging
onto windows adjacent to the balcony.
	   The two wrestlers on the mat at the time stood up and stared at
the balcony in disbelief. Other wrestlers and spectators rushed to
help people trapped under huge pieces of concrete.
	   ``Within 10 minutes the wrestlers had lifted the fallen pieces
off and freed the people underneath,'' Sherbakov said.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in the southern city of Nalchik, about 1,400 kilometers
(850 miles) south of Moscow in the Kabardino-Balkaraya republic.
About 2,500 people were in the stadium at the time.
	   Sherbakov described the balcony as a standing room only area
where non-paying spectators could watch the event. As a result,
most of those on the balcony were children who couldn't afford
tickets, he said.
	   A criminal investigation has been opened into the incident.
Friday has been declared a day of mourning in the region.
	   Alexander Khashkhovov, assistant to Kabardino-Balkaraya
president Valery Kokov, said the collapse occurred because the
stadium was old, even though it was completed only four years ago.
	   Sherbakov said the stadium was in poor condition.
	   ``It could have collapsed because of poor construction, but
there were also too many people on the balcony,'' he said.
	   Shoddy construction and poor maintenance are endemic in Russia,
where funds for construction and repair of public buildings have
all but disappeared since the Soviet collapse.
	   At least four cranes were brought to the scene, including one
that was driven into the stadium to help lift heavy debris.
	   The dead were carried outside and covered with sheets.

Chinese wait hours to see a waving hand _ perhaps Clinton's

<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ For four or five hours, they waited by the
thousands. Some debated Chinese-U.S. relations. Others munched
rolls. In the end, most caught only a glimpse of a waving hand
behind a dark limousine window _ perhaps U.S. President Bill
Clinton's _ and still they cheered.
	   Residents of Xi'an thronged the ancient city's broad boulevards
Thursday night, crashing a party they weren't invited to welcome
Clinton to China.
	   ``People are really geared up tonight _ out of respect for
Clinton,'' said a Miss Wang, one of the hundreds of government and
state enterprise workers who joined other hundreds of uniformed
police in the highly visible but mostly low-key security detail.
	   Exuberance fueled the masses as they infused Xi'an's usually
chaotic streets with a dash of unaccustomed free speech. An elderly
man in white stubble and undershirt questioned why the United
States was always bashing China about human rights. Two middle-aged
women discussed Clinton's alleged peccadilloes.
	   Young punks in tight pants and faux leopard-skin shirts, older
women with freshly permed hair, plainly dressed office workers all
pressed against the metal railing lining South Avenue, hours before
Air Force One landed in Xi'an. Most came out of curiosity, others
from outright admiration. Clinton's presence was felt, if not seen.
	   ``Clinton's not a man. He's a mountain,'' said one worker
surnamed Wang, who waited for five hours but was too deep in the
crowd even to spot the departing motorcade.
	   On the far side of the imposing 12-meter-high South Gate,
Clinton was ushered in to China's imperial capital with dances and
processions loosely based on 1,200-year-old Tang Dynasty
traditions. Mounted warriors holding lances and yellow-gowned
maidens carrying ceremonial fans greeted the president and his
wife, Hillary.
	   A politely enthusiastic crowd of 500 or so carefully selected
students and government bureaucrats applauded the Americans'
entrance and Clinton's speech. His entourage then entered the South
Gate for a private reception and more performances.
	   The massive gate and city wall hid the spectacle from the crowds
patiently waiting inside the older part of the city. When a waving
Clinton finally emerged walking toward his limousine, people
cheered, whistled and clapped.
	   ``He was in the second car, or the third car. I saw a hand
waving,'' said Xue Bin, a middle-aged worker. ``It would have been
better to see him. But not seeing him was good too.''
	   Liu Shenyang, a 21-year-old university student of engineering,
admitted he felt ``a bit disappointed.
	   ``I worship him. I feel he's very capable. His China policy was
a bit rough at first, but it's gotten better and better and
relations between the countries have gotten better,'' said Liu.
	   The crowds followed Clinton to his hotel. Scores milled about
the sidewalk, prompting security officers to park trucks outside
the windowed lobby to discourage gawkers. Uniformed and
plainclothes police shouted at people to leave.
	   At the Ginza International Shopping Center, four night watchmen
pulled stools outside for a more comfortable wait. They too only
saw his hand.
	   ``We wish he had come out of his car,'' said a 24-year-old
watchman named He. ``It was worth it. This was a rare
opportunity.''

Popular singer slain; 18 militants and five other civilians dead also wounded, no claim of responsibility

Eds: UPDATES with details of attack, wife and two sisters-in-law
By RACHID KHIARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Popular Algerian singer Lounes Matoub,
who survived an earlier kidnapping by Muslim militants and only
recently returned from exile, was killed near his Berber hometown
Thursday.
	   It was the latest assassination of an Algerian artist during a
6-year-old Muslim insurgency that has left more than 75,000 people
dead.
	   Matoub, 42, who like other Berbers fiercely criticized both the
military-backed government and Muslim militants, was killed outside
the village of Oued Aissi, near the Berber regional capital of
Tizi-Ouzou in eastern Algeria.
	   A brief statement by Algeria's security services said Matoub was
``cowardly assassinated,'' and that he was shot several times.
	   His wife and two sisters-in-law were also wounded in the attack
and were hospitalized, according to witnesses at the scene of the
shooting.
	   They said Matoub's car was stopped at a false roadblock, but the
singer drove on. The assailants then showered the car with bullets.
He was apparently shot three times in the head.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   Living in exile in France since his 1994 kidnapping, Matoub had
only returned to Algeria this month. The militants have killed
other singers including Cheb Hasni, as well as intellectuals.
	   ``He had the courage to denounce, to speak out,'' Algeria's
best-known singer Cheb Khaled said in a radio interview in France,
where he lives in exile. ``It's not over. ... The situation is
still critical.''
	   A spokeswoman for Triomphe records in Paris, which carries
Matoub, said the singer was killed as he drove out of the village.

Arab League condemns Israel's plans to extend Jerusalem authority 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Arab League leader meeting with EU envoy.
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Thursday condemned
Israel's decision to extend some Jerusalem municipal services to
West Bank settlements, calling it an attempt to ``eliminate the
Arab identity of east Jerusalem.''
	   The 22-member league also warned in a statement that the
implementation of the plans will ``destroy the (Middle East) peace
process and put the entire area on the brink.'
	   The meeting was called by the Palestinians to discuss an Israeli
blueprint for Jerusalem that would extend some services to Jewish
West Bank settlements _ a step the Palestinians fear will lead to
the annexation of West Bank land, and will choke off Arab parts of
Jerusalem from other Palestinian areas.
	   ``This is a very dangerous decision and will have grave
consequences,'' the statement said.
	   Later Thursday, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
met with the European Union envoy to the Middle East, Miguel
Moratinos, and asked him to intervene to stop the Israeli move.
	   Moratinos, who arrived in Cairo from Lebanon Thursday, told
reporters: ``The European Union rejects all unilateral measures
that contradict international law and international legitimacy,''

World Cup: Spain adds new chapter in country's underachievement editing. 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: CORRECTS to victory over Bulgaria in 12th graf; minor
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ If awards for disappointment are ever
issued, Spain better find a gigantic trophy case.
	   The Iberian crew wrote probably the most spectacular chapter in
the national team's history of underachievement Wednesday night,
scoring a tournament high number of goals in a 6-1 thrashing of
Bulgaria and still getting ousted from the competition.
	   The victory and subsequent elimination brought tears to many
Spanish fans. Despite the victory, the final Group D games saw
Nigeria and Paraguay advance but sent Spain home with its earliest
exit since 1978.
	   For other Spaniards, it was only more expected disillusionment,
albeit more dramatic than usual.
	   One of the world's perennial powers, analysts long have been
puzzled as to why Spain has never achieved the pedigree along the
likes of Brazil, Italy, Germany or Argentina.
	   Despite always being mentioned as a contender, its only major
title has been the 1964 European Championship.
	   It has, however, narrowly missed out on several occasions.
	   It was eliminated from the 1994 World Cup quarterfinals by
eventual finalist Italy in a game all agreed it deserved to win.
	   Then in the 1996 European Championship, it swamped host England
with superior style and speed, only to go out in the quarterfinals
on penalties.
	   Coach Javier Clemente had said in previous years Spain lacked a
serious striker, but this year he had internationally acclaimed
Raul Gonzalez, Luis Enrique and Fernando Morientes.
	   This time, the 48-year-old Basque attributed the stumble to
misfortune.
	   ``We gave it all we could; luck was just not with us,'' he said
after the victory over Bulgaria, offering what has come to be
almost a stock response for the Spaniards.
	   Dutch legend Johan Cruyff believes Spain was punished for
underestimating its opponents.
	   ``Spain's situation is no disappointment. It never does anything
in the World Cup anyway,'' he added earlier in the week as
elimination loomed.
	   His comment touched on what many feel may be the crux of the
matter: Nobody expects Spain to go far because the team itself
doesn't.
	   ``We're going out with our heads high because although we didn't
go through. We fought to the end on the pitch,'' said defender
Miguel Angel Nadal, who looked relaxed Thursday when many expected
him to be bitterly disappointed.
	   Spain came into its sixth consecutive World Cup finals riding
high expectations after losing only one game since the 1994
tournament.
	   It admitted it had a tough group with Nigeria, Paraguay and
Bulgaria, but never for a moment doubted its ability to reach the
second round.
	   Some believe Clemente failed to respond adequately after it's
opening 3-2 sting by Nigeria.
	   ``Clemente panicked after the Nigerian defeat, and so did the
team '' said Ramon Besa, a senior sports journalist with Spain's
leading daily El Pais. ``Against Paraguay, they were mentally
frazzled. They didn't know how to respond.''
	   When they did finally react against Bulgaria, it was too late.
	   Calls for Clemente's job are likely but they'll be few.
	   Players and fans know that, for all his unfilled promises, he's
still the best available and success will just have to wait.
	   ``He's a coach who went for four years without losing. Here
we've lost just one game,'' Nadal said. ``But nobody can deny his
class, and if somebody disputes it, I as a veteran player can
testify that he is the best we've had.''

Former Canadian prime minister Joe Clark to seek office again 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Joe Clark, who in 1979 served a 10-month
stint as Canada's youngest prime minister, announced Thursday that
he will attempt a comeback into national politics.
	   Clark, 59, said he would seek the vacant post of leader of the
Progressive Conservative Party, which he headed from 1976 until
1982.
	   The party was routed from power in 1993 and now is the weakest
of the five parties in Parliament with only 19 seats. Opinion polls
put its nationwide support at about 12 percent.
	   Though Clark often is depicted as bland, he immediately becomes
the front-runner among at least five candidates seeking to replace
Jean Charest as Progressive Conservative leader.
	   Charest, one of Canada's most popular politicians, left federal
politics earlier this year to prepare to run for the premiership of
Quebec in a challenge against that province's separatist
government.
	   Clark, a native of Alberta, was elected to Parliament in 1972
and won a surprise victory as Progressive Conservative leader in
1976.
	   In 1979 he won a minority government over Pierre Trudeau's
Liberal Party.
	   But 10 months later, Clark's government lost a vote of
non-confidence and an ensuing election. He then lost the
Conservative leadership to Brian Mulroney, who later appointed
Clark to an eight-year stint as foreign minister.
	   Clark left politics in 1993 and has enjoyed success as an
international business consultant.
	   Conservative Party strategist Hugh Segal and former Manitoba
cabinet minister Brian Pallister are considered Clark's main
challengers in the party leadership vote this fall.
	   The next federal election must be held by the summer of 2002 but
could come sooner.

Holbrooke continues negotiations in Kosovo

Eds: UPDATES with quote from Hill in graf 4-5.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to negotiate a cease-fire Thursday in Kosovo, meeting with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and demanding a pullback of government
forces in the province.
	   Aiming to head off NATO intervention in Kosovo, Holbrooke spent
several hours with Milosevic in the presidential palace for the
second time in three days.
	   The West is urging ``that security forces, the armed forces on
both sides, should dismantle the checkpoints and withdraw to ...
barracks,'' Holbrooke told reporters at a news conference for the
Yugoslav media.
	   Christopher Hill, U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, who has been
active in peace efforts in the region, clarified the request,
saying only ``special police who have been engaged in some of the
operation need to be pulled back.''
	   ``It's not a request that all police in Kosovo need to be pulled
back nor it is a request that Yugoslavia not exercise its right to
control its borders,'' Hill told reporters.

Capriati `heartbroken' after loss to McNeil 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Jennifer Capriati's return to
Wimbledon after a five-year absence ended after one victory.
	   Capriati lost in the second round Thursday to 34-year-old Lori
McNeil, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.
	   Capriati was devastated by her defeat, fleeing Wimbledon for her
nearby rented house. When she returned to face the media 2 1/2
hours later, she was still red-eyed.
	   ``It's very disappointing and I'm pretty heartbroken about it,''
Capriati said, ``especially because I think I really had the match.
I really should have won.
	   ``But it's just so tough going off and on the court because of
the rain, and she hit some good serves. I think anybody would have
had problems with those serves.''
	   Capriati knew that if she had been able to convert the game
points she held at the start of the final set, the outcome could
have been different.
	   ``I think that would have made a difference,'' Capriati
admitted. ``She just gained confidence as the match went on from
there, and I had a few shaky shots because of the conditions. It
got pretty gusty out there and I gave her a few easy shots and her
confidence just went higher.''
	   Despite her defeat, Capriati said she will be back at the All
England Club.
	   ``Definitely,'' she said. ``This is one of my favorite
tournaments. Today it's not, but it's definitely special and the
one people remember the most.''
	   McNeil, like Capriati, needed a wild card to compete at
Wimbledon this year.
	   It was exactly 10 years ago that McNeil reached her highest
ranking of nine. And it was exactly four years ago that she upset
Steffi Graf on Centre Court to establish herself as the only player
in Grand Slam history to defeat the defending champion in the first
round.
	   It wasn't until the deciding set that McNeil took control
against Capriati, holding off four game points in the first three
games as she built a 4-0 lead. Coming to the net and challenging
Capriati to pass her, she forced her younger opponent into errors.
	   The first set had swung on the seventh game, when McNeil was
broken with a forehand winner after serving four double-faults. In
the second set, Capriati broke to lead 4-3 and held a point for 5-3
before McNeil rallied to win the last three games and take the
match into a decider.
	   ``When we came back out after a rain break at 3-all (in the
second set) she had a tough time when I was slicing my returns
low,'' said McNeil. ``She really had a difficult time passing, and
with the wind in a certain direction she had a really difficult
time handling the shots.
	   ``She was still hitting out, but on grass I think the advantage
is to the player that comes in on certain situations. If you
constantly have to keep coming up with the great passing shot it's
pretty difficult, I think.''
	   McNeil's ranking has slipped to 127 because she missed most of
the 1997 season with a stress fracture in her foot.
	   Now, after beginning the year ranked 305, McNeil is on the
comeback trail.
	   ``There's no doubt that I'm pretty much towards the end of my
career,'' she acknowledged, ``but I still enjoy playing and I plan
on playing the rest of the year. I'm like being out there knowing I
can still play the game.''
	   So is this her last Wimbledon?
	   ``I'm not making that decision yet,'' she insisted. ``I always
said I would play until I'm 35 (which happens on December 18th),
not knowing if I would play when I'm 35 or stop when I'm 35. Being
here is a bonus and I'm happy to play here again. It's my favorite
tournament.''

Israeli officials express uncertainty over referendum 
</HEADLINE>

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the first time since floating the idea,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ministers in his government
indicated Thursday that a referendum on an Israeli troop withdrawal
from the West Bank was not a sure thing.
	   The comments came a day after State Department officials in
Washington hinted that a national vote on an American proposal
would be unwelcome if it meant further delay in the peace process.
	   Netanyahu has appointed a ministerial committee to research the
idea of a national vote and has said he felt public input over a
plan to cede West Bank land to the Palestinians, was essential.
	   But Palestinians and several Israeli officials including
President Ezer Weizman and members of Netanyahu's coalition have
come out against the referendum idea, calling it a waste of time.
	   A referendum would delay an Israeli troop pullback by at least
two more months and has been denounced by the Palestinians and
Israeli opposition leaders as a waste of time.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat, who is chairing the
referendum committee, said Thursday that the chances were
``fifty-fifty,'' that a vote would be carried out.
	   Such a referendum would have to be approved by a majority of the
Knesset, or parliament members and Livnat acknowledged that the
government cannot guarantee a majority of Knesset support for the
idea.
	   ``The answer as to whether or not we will have a referendum is
not clear,'' Livnat said.
	   The United States has been urging Israel to approve a proposal
it submitted in January for turning over 13 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians have accepted
the idea, but Netanyahu has yet to respond.
	   Earlier this week, Israel's justice minister recommended that a
non-binding polling take place after a government decision on the
withdrawal is made.
	   But Thursday Netanyahu said he was not closer to making a formal
decision on the referendum.
	   ``When we come up with an agreement, if we come up with an
agreement, then the government will have to decide both about the
agreement and about the matter of the referendum,'' Netanyahu said
in a speech at the Moshe Dayan Forum for Social Policy Studies in
Tel Aviv.
	   Meanwhile, several of Netanyahu's right wing coalition partners
spoke out against the idea of a referendum. The Israeli daily
Yediot Ahronot reported that at least two coalition parties were
expected to vote against the holding of a referendum if and when
the question was brought to a vote in Parliament.
	   Coalition chairman Meir Sheetrit told Israel radio the
government should devote its time to the peace process and not
public opinion polls.
	   ``You cannot conduct a referendum when you don't know what you
are holding a referendum on. I would suggest laying the referendum
aside and focusing on advancing the agreement,'' Sheetret said.

<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's introduction
to China was a ceremony fit for an emperor.
	   Men dressed as ancient warriors and dancing women draped in
white silk and carrying glowing red lanterns greeted Clinton on his
arrival in the ancient imperial capital Xi'an for his first night
in China.
	   Young men beat drums that measured six feet(almost 2
meters)across. Women wearing stark white facial powder and
blood-red lipstick presented the president and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton with bouquets of flowers and baskets of fruit.
	   Xi'an Mayor Feng Xichu gave Clinton the ceremonial gold key to
the city. ``I believe it will bring good luck and joy to your
efforts,'' Feng said.
	   The ceremony was outside the ancient city's fortress-like South
Gate, where 40-foot-high (12 meters) walls were built to deter
enemies. It was the ceremonial greeting given to emperors during
the Tang Dynasty more than 1,000 years ago.
	   Clinton appeared delighted by the spectacle. He bent toward Mrs.
Clinton several times to point out feats of grace as dancers bowed
their way. His steps were cushioned by a 200-yard-long (182 meters)
red carpet.
	   The 600-year-old South Gate, crenelated like the top of a
medieval castle, was strung with warm yellow lights.
	   Inside the compound where emperors of yore greeted visiting
guests, the president and his entourage watched children practice
calligraphy and listened to a Chinese orchestra play traditional
songs. A fish pond and neon-lighted dragons were part of the scene,
too.
	   Clinton tried his hand at a little Chinese, too. He addressed
the crowd with ``Ni, hao ma?'' That means, ``Hello, how are you?''
He closed with ``Xie xie,'' or ``Thank you.''
	   ___
	   Clinton had more than one reason to enter China through ancient
Xi'an rather than the bustling capital of Beijing.
	   Starting in Xi'an allowed a chance to combat the effects of jet
lag before meetings starting Friday with President Jiang Zemin.
China is 12 hours ahead of Washington, and even in the comfort of
Air Force One, the flight was an exhausting 16 hours.
	   Of course, there were aesthetic reasons to visit Xi'an as well.
Xi'an was the capital of imperial China for 1,100 years, the home
of iron-handed emperor Qin Shihuangdi, the ruler who unified China
_ but also had books burned and scholars buried alive.
	   The city, an industrial outpost in the north, boasts thousands
of life-sized terra cotta warriors buried in pits to guard Qin's
spirit.
	   ___
	   If being first lady is an official job, then Mrs. Clinton got a
promotion by going to China.
	   The mayor of Xi'an presented the key to the city to ``your
excellency, Mr. President and Mrs. President.''
	   The first lady planned to break away from her husband's schedule
Saturday to hold a dialogue with women in Beijing on ``challenges
and opportunities in a changing society.''
	   She also will address issues facing women and girls in visits to
a girls' school, a law center and a training center in Shanghai and
in a roundtable setting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
in Hong Kong.
	   The last time Mrs. Clinton was in China, in September 1995, she
attended a U.N. conference on the state of the world's women. In a
speech, she scolded the Chinese and other societies for denying
women equal opportunities.
	   Mrs. Clinton will attend the signing Saturday of a health
partnership between the United States and China, tour a children's
hospital in Shanghai, deliver a speech at the Shanghai Library and
visit a Shanghai synagogue.
	   Her mother, Dorothy Rodham, and daughter, Chelsea, are on the
trip as well.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Protesters planted bombs, smashed
automated bank machines and severed and burned telephone cables,
reacting with fury Thursday to the privatization of Puerto Rico's
telephone company.
	   One bomb exploded in a policeman's hands at a bank in the
southern coastal town of Santa Isabel. The bomb, concealed in a
flashlight, was planted at a branch of Banco Popular, part of a
consortium buying the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. It tore one finger
off the officer's right hand and wounded his left hand and leg.
	   Police Chief Pedro Toledo said Thursday that he did not rule it
out as ``an act of terrorism'' by the clandestine Los Macheteros
guerrilla group, among a minority of islanders who want
independence for this U.S. commonwealth. Los Macheteros last week
said the telephone workers' protest was part of the fight for
independence.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bomb.
	   The rash of sabotage started hours after Gov. Pedro Rossello
signed a law on Wednesday finalizing the dlrs 1.9 billion sale of
the company, commonly called Telefonica, to a consortium led by the
U.S. communications giant GTE Corp.
	   The deal awaits the approval of the Federal Communications
Commission, which could take months.
	   In a surprise move Thursday, the Spanish communications company
Telefonica Internacional S.A., presented a belated offer to buy
Telefonica. Spokesman Jose Luis Fernandez said their offer bettered
that of GTE by more than dlrs 25 million, the amount the government
would have to pay GTE if it abandoned the deal.
	   Meanwhile, a leading trade union on the island, the General
Workers' Council, announced Friday it is closing its account with
Banco Popular and encouraged its affiliates and their 50,000
members to take their money out of the bank because of its
participation in the sale.

Donna Andrews quietly takes charge on LPGA Tour AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   ABSECON, New Jersey (AP) _ Donna Andrews knew what she had to do
to make the Solheim Cup team. And it was almost as easy as simply
deciding to get the job done to propel her to a big year on the
LPGA Tour.
	   ``I was getting a lot of 11ths through 20ths,'' Andrews said
Thursday at the Shoprite LPGA Classic, ``and you don't get Solheim
Cup points for that.''
	   Coming into the season, Andrews was not among the top-10 on the
points list who get automatic spots on the team that will play the
European team in September in Ryder Cup-style matches.
	   Andrews ranked 11th, and to get the points she needed, she had
to gain ground, then hold her spot. To do that, she needed to get
top-10 finishes.
	   She has done that in a big way.
	   In 14 events this year, Andrews has been in the top-10 10 times,
won the Longs Drugs Challenge in April and has finished second in
her last four starts. She leads the LPGA money list with dlrs
525,944.
	   ``It was just a matter of going back to the Donna Andrews
swing,'' she said. ``Tempo and rhythm are my game. When I am not
playing well, I am usually trying to find someone else's swing.''
	   The Shoprite, which starts Friday at the Seaview Marriott
Resort, will be a good time for Andrews to make certain she has the
correct swing.
	   With the U.S. Women's Open next week, this tournament has a top
field, including Annika Sorenstam, Karrie Webb, Laura Davies,
defending champion Michelle McGann, and Alison Nicholas and Nancy
Lopez, who staged a stirring duel in the Open last year that was
won by Nicholas.
	   Rather than feed off her success each week _ she hasn't finished
lower than second since the Titleholders May 3 _ Andrews finds she
must rein in her enthusiasm.
	   ``I tend to get a little faster and try to hit a little harder
as I go through the week,'' Andrews said. ``When I get to Monday, I
have to start all over again and shorten it up.''
	   Whatever she is doing, it is working.
	   Since the Welch's tournament March 15, Andrews has been in the
top-six in nine of 10 starts. She's having an Annika Sorenstam-type
year and it has brought with it the financial rewards that can
distract a player.
	   ``It would be easy when you are No. 1 in your sport to have your
head in the clouds,'' Andrews said. ``I haven't let that happen.''
	   She keeps her feet firmly planted in the farm in North Carolina
where her husband, John Reeves, and her animals give her peace of
mind.
	   ``My horses, my family and my dogs have always been my outlet on
the golf course,'' she said. ``Sometimes when I'm walking the
course, I try to think of a name for a new horse.''
	   The death recently of a foal and then a couple of weeks later
the mare, distracted Andrews from her golf briefly, but ultimately
helped her bring a new peace to the course.
	   ``It made me realize that winning and losing on the golf course
isn't all there is in life,'' she said.
	   And almost as simply as that, Andrews found the attitude and
swing to carry her to the top of the LPGA.

Clinton gives China gentle lecture on human rights AP White House Correspondent

<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ After a welcome in the grand style of
ancient emperors, U.S. President Bill Clinton gently lectured China
on human rights Thursday and rejected criticism of his attempt to
strengthen relations.
	   ``We have a powerful ability to help each other grow,'' he
declared.
	   Clinton's high-stakes journey through China began amid reports
of detention or harassment of several dissidents, a matter U.S.
Ambassador James Sasser planned to raise Friday with government
officials.
	   Clinton also will urge President Jiang Zemin to allow freer
political dialogue without government interference, said national
security spokesman P.J. Crowley. The White House already protested
denial of visas to three Radio Free Asia reporters.
	   Beginning a nine-day visit, Clinton was treated to an
extravagant celebration of costumed warriors and dancers cavorting
to thunderous drums among a blaze of red lanterns. The welcome was
based on Tang Dynasty traditions dating to the 7th century. Xi'an
Mayor Feng Xichu gave Clinton a ceremonial key to the city,
introducing Clinton and his wife, Hillary, as ``Mr. President and
Mrs. President.''
	   ``A new day is dawning for the Chinese people, for China's
greatness lies, as always, with its people,'' the president said.
His remarks were heard by several hundred invited guests, but tens
of thousands stood silently on the streets to glimpse Clinton's
50-car motorcade.
	   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' Clinton said. ``In this global information age, ...
a commitment to providing all human beings the opportunity to
develop their full potential is vital to the strength and success
of the new China as well.''
	   The first presidential visit since the bloody 1989 Tiananmen
Square crackdown, Clinton's trip is intended to help stabilize
U.S.-Chinese relations after years of grudging distrust. With
little expectation of breakthroughs, officials said the symbolism
of Clinton's trip is likely to outweigh the substance.
	   On Friday, Clinton was to visit Xia He, a rural village of 400
people, to talk about China's economic reforms and growing personal
freedoms. In Xia He, all citizens 18 and older can vote in village
elections.
	   The president's remarks, in a discussion with ordinary Chinese
citizens, were expected to emphasize the importance of U.S.
cooperation with China, the world's most populous country, despite
severe differences over human rights, trade, arms sales and Taiwan.
	   ``There may be those here and back in America who wonder whether
closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are
good,'' Clinton said in his Xi'an speech. ``Clearly the answer is
yes. We have a powerful ability to help each other grow. We can
learn much from each other.''
	   Clinton's trip, his first to China, spans five cities and will
expose him to a broad cross section of people, from communist
leaders to college students pressing for democratic change. The
president is to meet with religious leaders, stockbrokers and
representatives of business, the arts, law and the media.
	   His trip was preceded by angry criticism that China does not
warrant normal relations with the United States because of
political and religious persecution, censorship and authoritarian
rule. The most closely watched moment of the trip comes Saturday,
when Clinton is to stand at the edge of Tiananmen Square for a
welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of the People.
	   In a reminder of political divisions, Republican lawmakers
refused to join the congressional delegation accompanying Clinton.
A diverse group of organizations urged that he not go to Tiananmen,
contending his presence would dishonor the hundreds _ perhaps
thousands _ of people killed as military troops closed in on the
square to crush pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.
	   Clinton, promising to speak up for human rights, argued that
critics were emphasizing protocol over policy.
	   At home, congressional investigations also were looking into
allegations that China gleaned information for its missile program
from Clinton's authorization for China to launch U.S. satellites.
	   China's foreign ministry spokesman, Tang Guoqiang, said
cooperation on satellite launches ``benefits both sides. Those who
are in the mainstream of bilateral relations should have a correct
view.''
	   Clinton's trip, following Jiang's state visit to Washington last
October, is seen as an important step toward erasing the stigma of
Tiananmen and putting U.S.-Chinese relations on a more even keel.
Every country but the United States has lifted Tiananmen-related
sanctions against China, and the United States is the only nation
that does not grant China permanent most-favorable trade status.
	   Xi'an, Clinton's opening stop, was imperial China's capital but
now is a gritty industrial city of 6.5 million. It is the site of
one the most spectacular archaeological finds of the 20th century:
more than 7,000 life-size terra cotta horses and armored warriors
buried in battle formations near the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang
more than 2,000 years ago.
	   The burial of the figures on a large scale replaced the practice
of sacrificing humans and animals to accompany emperors to the
afterlife.
	   Historians say construction of the tomb took 39 years and
involved as many as 750,000 laborers. Peasants digging a well
rediscovered the tomb in 1974.
	   Clinton and his family were to tour the excavations Friday
before flying to Beijing. Besides the first lady, Clinton also is
accompanied by daughter Chelsea, home from her freshman year at
Stanford University, and Dorothy Rodham, the first lady's mother.

Italian deputies appeal against death penalty case in Virginia from Barnabei to Bernabei, father, not inmate, born in Italy, ADDS U.S. citizenship 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: WRITETHRU to CORRECT spelling in 2nd graf, `` The death etc''
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Protesting the death sentence ordered for the son of
an Italian immigrant, 240 deputies by Thursday had signed a
petition asking the state of Virginia to grant the man a new trial.
	   ``The death penalty is always wrong and morally unacceptable,''
read the petition circulated in the Chamber of Deputies, Italy's
lower legislative chamber. ``Adding to this, there are several
doubts on (Rocco Derek) Bernabei's guiltiness.''
	   No execution date has been set for Bernabei, who was convicted
of the slaying of his girlfriend. He has several avenues of appeals
left.
	   In line with Italy's stiff opposition to the capital punishment,
which is not allowed in this country, an Undersecretary for Foreign
Affairs, Patrizia Toia, said Wednesday she would bring Bernabei's
case to the attention of the European Union.
	   Italian government officials and various advocate groups have
spoken out on several other pending death penalty cases in the
United States.
	   According to Italian news reports, the inmate is the son of an
Italian from Siena, a town in northern Italy.

Actor's Cuba trip called `shameful' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A trip to Cuba by actor Jack Nicholson is
``shameful and disgraceful,'' in the view of Rep. Lincoln
Diaz-Balart, who was born on the island.
	   In remarks on the House floor Thursday, Diaz-Balart said
Nicholson has visited cigar factories, nightclubs and other tourist
sites but has not visited any of hundreds of prisons where, the
lawmaker said, thousands of political detainees languish.
	   He also chided the actor for reportedly calling the island a
``paradise.''
	   ``I would challenge Nicholson to see if it would be possible for
him to show some sensitivity,'' Diaz-Balart said.
	   The three-time Oscar winner was invited to Havana by the Cuban
Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry to discuss a Latin
American film festival planned for December.

Eds: UPDATES with police saying device was concealed in package,
By NICOLAS MARMIE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two people died and another was seriously injured
after an explosive device ripped through a second-floor apartment
in eastern Paris on Thursday, police said.
	   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
homemade device was concealed inside a package. The two victims
died after opening it.
	   Witnesses said they heard a loud blast which was followed by
thick black smoke.
	   One of the victims was a 45-year-old female English teacher of
Yugoslav origin. Police initially said the other victim was her
son, but officials later said they could not confirm the identity.
	   The explosion in the three-story building also left another
person, who was not identified, seriously injured, police said.
	   The device contained scrap metal and ball bearings, the police
officials said.
	   George Sarre, the mayor of the Bastille neighborhood, in east
Paris, had said the circumstances were unclear.
	   ``I don't know if they received a parcel, or if they were
fabricating something,'' Sarre told reporters near the scene of the
blast.
	   Authorities made no link between the blast and the World Cup.
French authorities have stepped up security around the soccer
championship, fearing possible attacks by extremists.
	   Anti-terrorist police were inspecting the scene of the explosion
Thursday night.
	   Previously, police had said the cause of the blast was probably
domestic.
	   The explosion occurred opposite the Sainte-Ambroise church in
the Bastille neighborhood.
	   Police cordoned off the area. The explosion occurred at about
6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT).
	   The explosion sparked fires in the building, which was
immediately evacuated. Firemen extinguished the flames.

World Cup: Germany advances with 2-0 victory over Iran 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Two precision goals highlighted a
workmanlike performance as Germany advanced to the second round of
the World Cup with Thursday night's 2-0 victory over Iran.
	   Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scored early in the second
half as Germany won Group F and will face Mexico in the second
round Monday, also at Montpellier.
	   Germany won the group on goal differential ahead of Yugoslavia,
which defeated the United States 1-0 in the night's other match.
Iran, which scored its first-ever World Cup victory over the United
States on Sunday, was eliminated.
	   Thomas Haessler and Bierhoff, the combination that worked so
well when Germany won the European Championship two years ago,
connected again to open the scoring in the 50th minute.
	   Haessler made a clinical right-wing cross to Bierhoff, who left
defenders Mohammad Khakpour and Mehdi Pashazadeh bumping into each
other as his header bounced high into the net from eight meters.
	   The second goal, in the 58th minute, was also a well-crafted
piece of soccer. Jorg Heinrich chased down a long pass and
one-touched the ball right to Bierhoff, who one-timed his shot off
the left post. Klinsmann was there for the easy rebound, putting it
in with an acrobatic, diving header.
	   The game pitted Germany's methodical precision against Iran's
swift counterattacks. Iran came out with a defensive strategy,
choking the German offense and countering whenever possible.
	   Iranian goalkeeper Ahmad Abedzadeh didn't have a difficult save
in the first half, while counterpart Andreas Koepke had to dive to
his right to stop Karim Bagheri's 35-meter drive off a set play.
	   Iran stepped up the attack after falling behind, but Germany had
the better scoring chances. Bierhoff was just wide in the 60th and
also missed the target with a header in the 86th.
	   Klinsmann's goal was his eighth in World Cup first-round play.
He scored four times in Germany's three opening round games in the
United States four years ago, twice in the 1990 group matches in
Italy, and also netted in the Germans' France 98 opener.
	   Before the game, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met with
French police providing security at the stadium. Kinkel also
expressed his government's sympathy for French police officer
Daniel Nivel, who was beaten into a coma by German hooligans Sunday
after the Germany-Yugoslavia game in Lens.

World Cup: Yugoslavs struggle to 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
URGENT

<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Slobodan Komljenovic headed in a rebound
off a free kick just over three minutes after the opening kickoff
Thursday night and Yugoslavia struggled to a 1-0 victory over the
United States in a World Cup match that turned out to be
meaningless for both sides.
	   The Americans, who already had been eliminated, merely were
playing for pride. As it turned out, so were the Yugoslavs, who
already had clinched a place in the second round and hoped for a
big victory to overtake Germany on goal difference and advance as
the winner from Group F.
	   But a 2-0 victory by Germany over Iran in Montpellier squelched
those hopes and the second half turned into a midfield quagmire.
	   For the second straight game the match had political overtones
for the Americans, who were coming off a 2-1 loss to Iran.
	   It was also the second straight game the Americans dominated
possession early and hit the post quickly only to be frustrated.
	   Frankie Hejduk sent a falling cross that got over the head of
goalkeeper Ivica Kralj and struck the far after post 24 seconds,
but the Yugoslavs cleared and absorbed several American forays in
the first 45 minutes.
	   The Yugoslav goal came on its second shot and first threatening
chance in the U.S. half. Sinisa Mihalovic blasted a curling
35-meter free kick that American goalkeeper Brad Friedel two-handed
away, but the rebound bounced to Komljenovic, who despite standing
almost on the end line headed the ball back down behind a
recovering Friedel.
	   The goal didn't seem to slow the Americans, who continued to
push forward and got a powerful header from the top of the box out
of Brian McBride that Kralj handled in the 15th minute.
	   Hejduk put another shot on goal with a scissors kick in the 25th
and the Americans generally created more chances than the
Yugoslavs.
	   One of Yugoslav's serious chances came in the 28th minute when
Savo Milosevic blasted a shot from the right that Friedel had to
punch away.
	   The Yugoslavs slowed the American offense in the second half,
limiting them to a handful of serious chances, but not creating
much more themselves.
	   About the only excitement for either side came in the way of
substitutions. Yugoslavia saw AC Milan forward Dejan Savicevic for
the first time in two months and Yugoslav native Preki
Radosavljevic came on for the United States against his former
countrymen.
	   The match was being played at a time of high political tension
between the two nations. Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy to the
United Nations, was in Yugoslavia in a last-ditch attempt to end
fighting between Yugoslav security forces and ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo province.
	   The Clinton administration blames Yugoslavia's hardline
president Slobodan Milosevic for the conflict. Should the peace
effort fail, NATO could soon carry out air strikes against the
Yugoslav forces.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Nearly 60 Ethiopian Jews arrived to a
festive welcome in Israel on Thursday, ending the saga of a
community that had been living in a special compound for two years.
	   But Ethiopian leaders said the exodus of Ethiopian Jews to
Israel is not complete.
	   ``How can the prime minister and absorption minister throw a
joyous party when others are left behind?'' said Adisso Massala, a
legislator of Ethiopian origin.
	   Massala said some 5,000 Ethiopian Jews are still waiting to
immigrate to Israel. Most live in the remote northern city of
Gondar. He called on Israel to open an office in Gondar to help the
Jews there leave to the Jewish state.
	   The 58 Ethiopians who arrived Thursday night are the last
Falashmura, or descendants of Jews who converted to Christianity,
who had been living in a special compound set up for them in the
Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa in 1996. They were allowed into
Israel to be reunited with relatives.
	   About 60,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel. Many arrived in two
dramatic airlifts in 1985 and 1991.
	   Last year, the government decided to close down the Falashmura
transit camp in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and bring its
4,000 residents to Israel.
	   Most of the Falashmura are now in Israel. However, Massala said
some 100 Falashmura are being left behind in Ethiopia so their
Jewish origins can be authenticated.
	   Israeli Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein, said Thursday's
arrivals did not close the chapter to immigration from Ethiopia.
	   ``There are still more Ethiopians who will come to Israel after
the camp is closed. We will not rest on our laurels,'' Edelstein
said.

US maneuvers to head off Security Council meeting on Jerusalem 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States sought Thursday to head
off a Security Council debate on Israel's plans for Jerusalem,
arguing any such discussion would complicate efforts to revive the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Bahrain informed the council Thursday that it was preparing a draft
resolution on Israel's plans to expand Jerusalem municipal services
to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   Bahrain, the only Arab country on the 15-member council, also
said Arab ambassadors to the United Nations wanted an open debate
on the issue, meaning that non-council members could participate.
	   As a rule, the Security Council accepts all such requests from
its members. But U.S. diplomats urged the council to hold off on
the request until the week of July 6. No decision was taken.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Jerusalem is ``one of the most sensitive issues in the peace
process'' and any Security Council discussion ``would be
counterproductive to the success of our discussions with the
Palestinians and the Israelis.''
	   Over U.S. protests, Israel's Cabinet unanimously approved a plan
Sunday to put Jewish settlements under Jerusalem municipal
authority for certain services, notably building and planning.
	   Settlements normally have to get approval from the defense
ministry for any construction. The United States has called for a
``time-out'' on any expansion of Jewish settlements in an effort to
help re-start the stalled peace talks.
	   On Thursday, the Arab League condemned the Israeli plan, calling
it an attempt to ``eliminate the Arab identity of east Jerusalem''
and ``destroy the peace process.''
	   Although no resolution has been formally submitted to the
Security Council, Arab ambassadors to the United Nations informally
circulated a draft Wednesday in hopes of gaining support from
non-Arab member states.
	   The Arab draft would condemn the expansion plan and demand that
it be rescinded. It also calls on Israel ``to refrain from all
actions of measures, including settlement activities, which are
illegal'' and could interfere with future talks on the status of
Jerusalem.
	   As a permanent council member, the United States could veto any
resolution condemning Israel. But having to resort to the veto is
considered a diplomatic setback because it shows that the permanent
member is unable to muster majority support.
	   Washington also believes such a resolution _ regardless of
whether it were approved _ would only serve to harden positions
among both the Palestinians and Israelis and destroy any chance for
compromise.
	   In a separate action, the Arabs have also asked the General
Assembly to consider a proposal to upgrade the status of the
Palestinian observer mission to the United Nations, granting it
most of the privileges of a member state except for voting rights.
	   At the urging of Washington, the Arabs agreed to postpone the
General Assembly debate until July 7.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The bodies of 40 guerrillas and the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed in fighting in south Lebanon
returned home Thursday night, completing the first stage of a swap
between Israel and Lebanon.
	   Lebanon received the bodies of the Hezbollah fighters, including
the son of the guerrilla movement's leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah,
with full military honors at 11.10 pm (2010 GMT).
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri led the ceremony at Beirut airport,
a move that showed the government recognized the Shiite Muslim
militants as national heroes.
	   ``We welcome today, with all respect, the bodies of a group of
our martyred children who return to the land where they grew up,
whose freedom they fought for and died for,'' Hariri said.
	   Lebanese soldiers carried the 40 coffins, wrapped in the
Lebanese flag, out of the French military transport plane that had
flown them from Tel Aviv, Israel.
	   The bodies will be buried in a funeral Friday.
	   Less than five hours earlier, Lebanon had loaded on to the same
aircraft the remains of Israeli Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya, a naval
commando who was killed in a botched raid in the south in
September. Later, Israel received him with full honors at a
military airport outside Tel Aviv.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross mediated the
exchange. ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques Fresard, who struck the deal
in 10 months of tortuous negotiations, oversaw the exchange,
traveling both ways on the 50-minute flight between Beirut and Tel
Aviv.
	   ``We brought back Itamar's remains to Israel and now we will
bring back 40 dead bodies to Lebanon so people will now have a
proper burial,'' Fresard said in Tel Aviv. ``This is going to make
a number of families extremely happy so, as a humanitarian
organization, we can only be satisfied by this,'' he said.
	   The second stage of the swap is scheduled to take place Friday
when Israel frees 60 Lebanese prisoners at a crossing point in
Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon.
	   There was relief about the exchange, which went ahead despite a
guerrilla ambush earlier in the day in the south that killed two
Israeli soldiers and wounded four others.
	   On the Israeli side of the swap, Ilya's remains arrived in
iceboxes in Tel Aviv where they were identified by an army chaplain
and placed into a coffin draped in the national flag.
	   Six naval commandos in white caps carried the coffin to a
military ambulance. Ilya will be buried Friday.
	   ``It's a mitzvah (Good deed) to return him to his family, to his
country,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Israel before
Ilya's body arrived.
	   Outside Beirut airport, scores of veiled women and bearded
Shiite men had waited for the coffins since the afternoon.
	   Zeinab Shehadeh hoped to know the fate of her guerrilla brother,
who was 24 when he disappeared in 1989 after he set off for an
attack on Israeli forces.
	   ``I'm waiting to see if he comes today,'' the 60-year-old woman
said. ``Otherwise, I will try tomorrow to look for him among the
released,'' she added.
	   She will be disappointed. Kamel Shehadeh's name was on neither
the list of those in coffins nor on the list of those to be
released Friday.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke tried
to negotiate an end to fighting in Kosovo Thursday, meeting with
Slobodan Milosevic a day after demanding the Yugoslav president's
forces leave the province.
	   Aiming to head off NATO intervention in Kosovo, Holbrooke sat
down with Milosevic in the presidential palace for several hours
for the second time in three days. Neither side commented
afterward.
	   Holbrooke also was to meet with a Russian envoy before heading
to Kosovo on Friday for talks with Ibrahim Rugova, the ethnic
Albanian leader, in the separatist province's capital of Pristina.
	   The West is urging ``that security forces, the armed forces on
both sides, should dismantle the checkpoints and withdraw to ...
barracks,'' Holbrooke said.
	   Christopher Hill, U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, who has been
active in peace efforts in the region, clarified the request,
saying only ``special police who have been engaged in some of the
operation need to be pulled back.''
	   ``It's not a request that all police in Kosovo need to be pulled
back nor it is a request that Yugoslavia not exercise its right to
control its borders,'' Hill told reporters.

Thriving bacteria colonies found in frozen polar lake AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a discovery that suggests life is possible
on Mars or on a frozen moon of Jupiter, researchers say they have
found colonies of bacteria thriving inside blocks of solid ice in
lakes near the South Pole.
	   A team of researchers drilling through the perpetual ice filling
shallow lakes in Antarctica, found teeming communities of microbes
living and thriving in temperatures that seldom rose above the
freezing point of water.
	   ``This is more proof that life is a lot more hardy than we once
thought,'' said Brian D. Lanoli of Oregon State University in
Corvallis, co-author of study being published Friday in the journal
Science.
	   If microbes can thrive in such frigid, hostile surroundings as
the Antarctic lakes, he said, then it could perhaps also be found
in the frozen seas of Europa, a moon of Jupiter, or the ice caps of
Mars.
	   ``Since we know there is ice elsewhere in our solar system, this
discovery makes us wonder if life might not exist there also,''
said Stephen J. Giovannoi, another co-author from Oregon State.
	   The researchers found the microbial colonies while drilling ice
cores from six lakes in Antarctica. As they drilled, they
discovered a layer of dust and grit down six to eight feet (two to
two and a half meters) below the surface of the always-frozen
lakes.
	   Giovannoi said the grains of soil set up a ``special set of
circumstances'' that made it possible for the microbes to live.
	   He said the dust was blown onto the ice during the Antarctic
summer during a time when the sun is always shining. The grains
absorbed solar heat and slowly sank into the ice. They reached a
point, about six to eight feet (two to two and a half meters) down,
and stopped sinking. A pocket of water formed around them and it
was here that the microbes set up their community.
	   The lakes are located in what is, in effect, a desert. The air
is very dry and precipitation is very low. Ice on the surface of
the ponds actually is eroded away continually. Water pockets
remain, however, at the same relative position, and eight to 10
feet (two and a half to three meters) above the bottom of the
lakes.
	   The lively time for the microbes lasts only while the sun
shines. Some of the organisms make food through photosynthesis from
the weak polar sun. But more than half of the year is spent in
twilight or total darkness of the extreme Antarctic seasons.
	   ``Their temperature, even when they are active, is about zero
degrees Centigrade (32 degrees F),'' said Giovannoi. This is just
at the freezing point of water.
	   In the winter, however, he said, the temperatures in the ice
drops to minus 20 F (minus 28.89 Celsius) or colder.
	   ``They (the microbes) are frozen in most of the year,'' said
Giovannoi. And, yet, he said, they have adapted to the extreme
conditions and are thriving.
	   ``What at first glance appears to be a contradiction in terms
(being frozen and leading an active life at the same time) turns
out to be an exciting example of the adaptation of microorganisms
to environmental extremes,'' the authors write in Science.
	   The physics that set up the conditions to enable the microbes to
live suggests that such environments could exist on Mars, which may
have frozen polar caps, or on Europa, a Jovian moon known to be
covered with frozen water, the researchers said.
	   It may be possible that in soil or sand grains embedded in ice
on can absorb enough solar energy to thaw the ice and create watery
pockets where microbes could survive, said Giovannoi.
	   This creates a whole new niche for microbial communities to
thrive in, he said.

World Cup: Yugoslavs struggle to 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: ADDS second-round opponents for Yugoslavia, Germany in new
fourth graf.
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Slobodan Komljenovic headed in a rebound
off a free kick just over three minutes after the opening kickoff
Thursday night and Yugoslavia struggled to a 1-0 victory over the
United States in a World Cup match that turned out to be
meaningless for both sides.
	   The Americans, who already had been eliminated, merely were
playing for pride. As it turned out, so were the Yugoslavs, who
already had clinched a place in the second round, hoped for a big
victory to overtake Germany on goal difference and advance as the
winner from Group F.
	   But a 2-0 victory by Germany over Iran in Montpellier squelched
those hopes and the second half turned into a midfield quagmire.
	   The results mean the Yugoslavs will play the Netherlands in
Toulouse on Monday while Germany will get Mexico in Montpellier.
	   For the second straight game the match had political overtones
for the Americans, who were coming off a 2-1 loss to Iran.
	   It was also the second straight game the Americans dominated
possession early and hit the post quickly only to be frustrated.
	   Frankie Hejduk sent a falling cross that got over the head of
goalkeeper Ivica Kralj and struck the far after post 24 seconds,
but the Yugoslavs cleared and absorbed several American forays in
the first 45 minutes.
	   The Yugoslav goal came on its second shot and first threatening
chance in the U.S. half. Sinisa Mihalovic blasted a curling
35-meter free kick that American goalkeeper Brad Friedel two-handed
away, but the rebound bounced to Komljenovic, who despite standing
almost on the end line headed the ball back down behind a
recovering Friedel.
	   The goal didn't seem to slow the Americans, who continued to
push forward and got a powerful header from the top of the box out
of Brian McBride that Kralj handled in the 15th minute.
	   Hejduk put another shot on goal with a scissors kick in the 25th
and the Americans generally created more chances than the
Yugoslavs.
	   One of Yugoslav's serious chances came in the 28th minute when
Savo Milosevic blasted a shot from the right that Friedel had to
punch away.
	   The Yugoslavs slowed the American offense in the second half,
limiting them to a handful of serious chances, but not creating
much more themselves.
	   About the only excitement for either side came in the way of
substitutions. Yugoslavia saw AC Milan forward Dejan Savicevic for
the first time in two months and Yugoslav native Preki
Radosavljevic came on for the United States against his former
countrymen.
	   The match was being played at a time of high political tension
between the two nations. Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy to the
United Nations, was in Yugoslavia in a last-ditch attempt to end
fighting between Yugoslav security forces and ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo province.
	   The Clinton administration blames Yugoslavia's hardline
president Slobodan Milosevic for the conflict. Should the peace
effort fail, NATO could soon carry out air strikes against the
Yugoslav forces.

Critics give Windows 98 mixed reception With US-Windows-98 and US-Windows-98-Launch 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   What critics are saying about Windows 98.
	   ... One reviewer (this one) described (Windows 95) as ``an
edifice built of baling wire, chewing gum and prayer.''
	   Windows 98 adds duct tape, caulk and pesticide. Think of it as a
minimal renovation that spruces up the place a bit, plugs some
leaks, exterminates some bugs and adds some new plumbing. The wire,
gum and prayer remain.
	   _ Stephen Manes, The New York Times
	   Windows 98 proves a main contention of Microsoft's most vocal
critics: Take away competition, and innovation also disappears.
	   How else can you explain this uninspiring ``upgrade'' to Windows
95, which goes on sale Thursday?
	   Windows 98 contains few improvements over Windows 95, the
operating system that runs most of the personal computers in the
universe. And none of the improvements are earthshaking enough to
make anyone run out and pay dlrs 89 for it.
	   _ David Einstein, San Francisco Chronicle
	   Windows 98 isn't going to make you get up and dance a jig. It's
an evolutionary upgrade, not one that significantly redefines the
way you work with your PC, especially if you've been using Internet
Explorer 4.0. When you come right down to it, the main reason to
switch to Win98 is just that it runs better than Win95. And since
you'll be able to upgrade from Win98 to NT 5.0 (if all goes as
Microsoft plans), you're not running down an evolutionary blind
alley.
	   _ Scott Finnie, Windows Magazine Online
	   If you liked Windows 95, you'll love Windows 98. That's not to
say it's perfect _ far from it. But the latest incarnation of the
world's most popular operating system fixes many of the bugs and
annoyances that plague Windows 95 users, and it's absolutely
essential for systems that incorporate new hardware advances like
DVD players and USB peripherals.
	   _ Ed Bott, PC Computing Online
	   If Windows 95 was a great leap forward, Win 98 is a series of
baby steps. No single feature of this dlrs 90 (street price)
upgrade screams 'buy me,' and many improvements are available as
free downloads or in recent Win 95 versions.
	   Ultimately, the new operating system's fate will be decided in
court. Moreover, industrial-strength Windows NT 5.0 waits in the
wings. It will incorporate most of Win 98's new features and should
be more secure, stable, and manageable. With NT 5.0 due early next
year, many users (especially corporate types) may wait before
upgrading.
	   _ Scott Spanbauer, PC World
	   Windows 98, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.
	   How about the fact it charges about dlrs 100 (dlrs 180 for the
full version) to fix hundreds of Win95 bugs that should have been
patched years ago? Or how it finally includes the improved drivers
Microsoft promised for 1995? Or how it adds yet another interface
metaphor on top of the six it has already, giving us the welcome
opportunity to retrain 200 million users. ...
	   Windows 98 should have been released for free on January 1, 1996
and titled Windows 95.1. If this were Hollywood, then Windows 98
would be the equivalent of ``Heaven's Gate,'' ``Waterworld'' and
``Godzilla'' rolled into one. A huge, overhyped, bloated
embarrassment.

Eds: UPDATES with Yugoslavia-US and Germany-Iran
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands and Mexico
advanced to the second round of the World Cup on Thursday, and so
did an American referee whose controversial decision to award a
penalty earlier this week was vindicated by a Norwegian television
replay.
	   Germany qualified with a workmanlike 2-0 victory over Iran at
Montpellier, with Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scoring
early in the second half. The loss eliminated Iran.
	   Yugoslavia advanced on Slobodan Komljenovic's goal in a 1-0 win
over the United States at Nantes, although the small margin of
victory meant the Yugoslavs couldn't overtake the Germans for first
place in Group F.
	   The Dutch and the Mexicans both stayed in the Cup after a 2-2
draw at Saint-Etienne, a game decided on Luis ``El Matador''
Hernandez' goal in the fifth minute of second-half injury time.
	   ``I am happy. It was an unbelievable game,'' said Hernandez, who
was a doubtful starter because of an ankle injury. ``It was a
fantastic game for us. A triumph for Mexico and the Mexican
people.''
	   While it was a thrilling finish _ Mexico was 2-0 down in the
75th minute _ the Mexicans needed to win for the game to make any
difference in either team's destiny in Group E. Belgium, the third
place team, eliminated itself by drawing 1-1 with South Korea at
Paris, so the Dutch won the group ahead of Mexico on goal
differential.
	   The results mean all four teams will be action Monday, with
Germany playing Mexico at Montpellier and the Netherlands facing
Yugoslavia at Toulouse.
	   Meanwhile, the chief of World Cup officiating defended his
embattled referees, including American Esse Baharmast, who awarded
the winning penalty kick to Norway in a 2-1 victory over Brazil on
Monday.
	   That result eliminated Morocco from the tournament and led to
charges Thursday from the African Football Confederation that the
continent had been victimized by ``one-sided'' refereeing and urged
FIFA to ``repair prejudice'' that resulted in the elimination of
African teams.
	   Initial replays of Baharmast's call showed contact but no clear
foul. But David Will, who runs FIFA's referee office, pointed to
photos taken from the Norwegian television network NRK that show
Brazil's Junior Baiano clearly grabbing the jersey of the Norwegian
player, Tore Andre Flo, in the penalty area.
	   ``The referee, from his angle, took a decision and played it as
he saw it, direct and straightforward,'' Will said. ``You can look
at television and photographs and pictures on the Internet. But at
the end of the day, the referee has to make a decision on the field
in a split second as he sees it.''
	   Baharmast and other referee whose call cost an African team a
chance to advance were picked Thursday for the officiating crews of
second-round World up games, albeit as substitutes. Baharmast and
Laszlo Vagner of Hungary, whose call nullified a crucial Cameroon
goal on Monday, could also be named as head referees for matches
later in the tournament.
	   Will said overall officiating in the Cup's first 40 games
averaged 8.3 points out of 10, and marks were getting better as the
tournament progressed. Most games were graded between 8 and 9 by
the officiating supervisors, he said.
	   ``We remain generally satisfied with the performance of the
referees,'' Will said. ``The overall standard remains high _ higher
than in the United States (in 1994), to be sure.''
	   Elsewhere, the fear of new World Cup violence was seen on the
streets of Leon, where bars closed and and schoolchildren planned
to stay home as the town prepares for Friday's England-Colombia
match.
	   Lens was hit by the World Cup's worst violence last Sunday when
German fans rampaged. A French policeman hit over the head by an
iron bar was left in a coma.
	   Fear of English soccer hooligans is running high. In addition,
many people dread a return of the Germans, who, according to
reports, might seek a confrontation Friday with the English.
	   ``You can understand their parents' fears,'' said primary school
teacher Evelyne Tumerelle, who said she was expecting said only
three of her 20 pupils to show up Friday.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
has announced alcohol restrictions. Officials banned its sale or
possession on the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Germany's Interior Ministry toughened border checks, with 1,000
border guards deployed. By noon Thursday, more than 10,000
travelers had been checked. Fourteen suspected hooligans had their
passports seized.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.' ''

Western powers warm to Nigeria amid 17 new prisoner releases 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INCORPORATES elements of Nigeria-Abacha, US-Nigeria.
By FRANK AIGBOGUN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Britain and the United States made
diplomatic moves to ease strained relations with Nigeria's military
regime Thursday amid growing signs that the country's best-known
political prisoner would be freed.
	   Seventeen prisoners were granted amnesty by military authorities
Thursday, although Moshood Abiola, 60, a former multi-millionaire
and apparent winner of 1993's presidential elections was not among
them.
	   Abiola, who was jailed by the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha in
1994, is likely to be released by Nigeria's new military leader in
``time,'' a senior junta official said Thursday.
	   ``There is every reason for the public to expect Abiola's
release. The government has already promised to look into his case.
But this could take a little more time,'' the official told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   He declined to give details but other Nigerian officials
announced that 17 other political detainees were being ordered
freed on Thursday, including two former government ministers _
Abubakar Rimi and Olu Falae _ and prominent human rights
campaigners Olisa Agbokoba and Frederick Fasheun.
	   Fasheun and the two ministers were held since January last year
for allegedly orchestrating a 1996 bombing campaign while Agbokoba
was accused of provoking riots in the southern city of Ibadan two
months ago.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the prisoners had already
returned home late Thursday.
	   The releases came as a European Union delegation led by British
Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd arrived in Nigeria on a mission
to improve relations with the sprawling West African country that
became an international pariah since 1993 under the rule of the
late Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Lloyd said he planned to discuss the EU's trade sanctions
against Nigeria and a flight ban on officials and family members of
the junta.
	   The U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Susan
Rice, said in Washington that Thomas Pickering, the State
Department's third-ranking official and a former ambassador to
Nigeria, will lead a delegation to Nigeria soon.
	   Rice suggested Nigeria might improve cooperation with U.S.
anti-drug efforts, a move that would allow Washington to lift
sanctions imposed under its drug cooperation certification program.
	   The latest prisoner releases announced in a government statement
bring to more than 40 the number of prominent detainees freed since
Abubakar was sworn in on June 8 just hours after Abacha died of
heart failure.
	   The latest prisoners were given freedom to ``strengthen the
process of national reconciliation,'' the government said in a
statement.
	   Increasing attention was focused on when, or if, Abiola would be
allowed to walk free.
	   Around 1,000 eager family members and supporters of Abiola
gathered Thursday at the Lagos international airport after several
local radio stations reported ``rumors'' that Abiola was being
flown home from prison in the capital of Abuja. It was not clear
where the rumors originated.
	   Several of Abiola's wives who were among the crowd said they
were hoping for the best _ but did not know if he was to be
released.
	   ``To my knowledge, they (the government) has not contacted any
member of the family,'' said his wife, Doyin, who heads a stable of
Nigerian newspapers. ``The family received the rumors with joy and
trepidation.''
	   Abubakar and Abiola reportedly met in government offices just
hours after Abubakar was sworn in earlier this month.
	   Details of their talks were not revealed, though Abubakar
reportedly told Abiola that the issue of his detention would be
``resolved'' soon.
	   Abiola, a once-wealthy businessman whose interests reached
across Nigeria, has been imprisoned since 1994, when he declared
himself president to commemorate the anniversary of the annulled
elections he is believed to have won.
	   Since then, his business empire has largely collapsed.
	   One of Abiola's wives, Kudirat, was killed in unclear
circumstances in 1996. She was an outspoken critic of Abacha, who
took power in a 1993 coup.

Lemieux sues Penguins' co-owner 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Retired Pittsburgh Penguins star Mario Lemieux
sued team co-owner Roger Marino on Thursday, saying he is owed more
than dlrs 33 million as part of a contract he signed in 1992.
	   ``Marino's conduct has been and is willful, wanton and
outrageous,'' said Lemieux's lawyer, Douglas Campbell, in the
lawsuit, which also seeks punitive damages. It characterized
Marino's motives as ``malicious and oppressive.''
	   The lawsuit was filed in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court a
day after Marino and his wife, Michelle, pledged a dlrs 25,000
donation to the Mario Lemieux Foundation, which benefits cancer
research and other medical programs. Lemieux was diagnosed with
Hodgkin's disease, a form of cancer that attacks the lymph nodes,
which caused him to miss the 1994-95 National Hockey League season.
	   Lemieux signed a seven-year, dlrs 42 million deal in 1992 that
was reworked after that season. He continues to collect despite
having retired last year.
	   Marino has said the expense of paying Lemieux when he wasn't
playing has financially hurt the team, which has had significantly
lower attendance since the star retired.
	   In May, the Penguins reported they will lose about dlrs 10
million for the season that just ended.
	   Lemieux alleged in his 13-page lawsuit that Marino tried to
sneak language into a paycheck that would have bound Lemieux to a
payment extension proposal if he tried to deposit his check.
Lemieux had already rejected an extension.
	   Lemieux's agent, Tom Reich, has said the lawsuit came only after
negotiations to obtain payments broke down.

Williams sisters flex their muscle at Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Centre Court at Wimbledon was
introduced Thursday to the astonishing physique of Serena Williams,
who wore a sleeveless dress that revealed rippling shoulder muscles
visible from the top row.
	   Over on Court 1, Venus Williams flexed some muscle herself,
slamming a serve at 125 mph (201 kph) _ the fastest ever recorded
in women's tennis.
	   Even Serena was impressed when informed of her older sister's
achievement.
	   ``Jeepers. Wow. No,'' Serena said. ``I'm behind. I really don't
know if I can catch up with that. She's much bigger than I am.
She's taller and she might have more power.''
	   She might. The issue could be settled soon, because the
inseparable sisters are one victory apiece away from a fourth-round
meeting next week.
	   Each easily dispatched a top-50 player in the second round
Thursday. Serena won a battle of 16-year-olds, sweeping the final
nine games to eliminate an unnerved Mirjana Lucic 6-3, 6-0. Venus
beat veteran Barbara Schett 6-1, 6-2.
	   There are just two remaining hurdles to a Williams-Williams
clash. Serena next plays Virginia Ruano-Pascual, while Venus faces
Chanda Rubin or Tara Snyder.
	   Venus has won the two previous showdowns between the sisters,
but she's wary about a rematch.
	   ``Serena is definitely a juggernaut,'' Venus said.
	   And how do you stop a juggernaut?
	   ``Just become a bigger one yourself,'' Venus said. ``I guess you
have to become a nemesis.''
	   Venus will be a nemesis for anyone in her path if she keeps
belting 125-mph serves. She learned of the achievement after her
match from Serena, who was told about it by reporters.
	   ``I wasn't going for any big ones today,'' Venus said, ``so that
was really a surprise.''
	   The serve, an ace in the third game of the second set, broke the
previous record of 123 mph (198 kph) set by Brenda Schultz-McCarthy
at Wimbledon last year. Williams' previous best was 122 (196 kph)
at the Lipton Championships this year.
	   Serena's personal best is 112 mph (180 kph). The fastest serve
in men's history was 143 mph (230 kph) by Greg Rusedski at last
year's U.S. Open.
	   Venus anticipates that her speed will continue to improve.
	   ``I've just turned 18, so I'm just going to get stronger,'' the
6-foot-1{ Williams said. ``I would imagine that my peak would be at
22 or 23. In the last year, I gained 9 mph on my serve.''
	   Against Schett, Venus also showed foot speed and finesse. She
won one point with a deft forehand drop shot, then won the next
with an ace. On match point, Williams hit a lunging backhand, then
raced to the other sideline and ripped a running forehand winner
down the line.
	   The only shot missing from her repertoire was the volley. She
remains hesitant about coming to the net.
	   ``You can't expect a person to throw away their old coat,
especially when it's their favorite,'' she said.
	   The reluctance to serve and volley could be costly against her
sister, who seems eager to charge forward in just her second
tournament on grass.
	   ``When I first was hitting on it, like the first week or so, I
didn't like it,'' Serena said. ``Now I really love it. Grass really
helps my game on other surfaces, because usually I don't attack at
all. It will help me come to the net more.''
	   That's a scary prospect. The youngster who looks like a body
builder is joining her sister as a powerful force in women's
tennis.

World Cup: Germany advances with 2-0 victory over Iran 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS quotes; optional upcoming
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Two precision goals highlighted a
workmanlike performance as Germany advanced to the second round of
the World Cup with Thursday night's 2-0 victory over Iran.
	   Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scored early in the second
half as Germany won Group F and will face Mexico in the second
round Monday, also at Montpellier.
	   Germany won the group on goal differential ahead of Yugoslavia,
which defeated the United States 1-0 in the night's other match.
Iran, which scored its first-ever World Cup victory over the United
States on Sunday, was eliminated.
	   ``We played against a very experienced team, which is more
physical and better technically than us,'' Iranian coach Jalal
Talebi said. ``But this World Cup was a great experience for us and
I hope it did a lot for the future of soccer in our country.''
	   Thomas Haessler and Bierhoff, the combination that worked so
well when Germany won the European Championship two years ago,
connected again to open the scoring in the 50th minute.
	   Haessler made a clinical right-wing cross to Bierhoff, who left
defenders Mohammad Khakpour and Mehdi Pashazadeh bumping into each
other as his header bounced high into the net from eight meters.
	   ``We tried hard in the first half, but it didn't work,''
Bierhoff said. ``We were always afraid that Iran would somehow
score.
	   ``We played better in the second half and after we scored the
first goal, things opened up a bit. We tried to come over the
flanks and cross and finally it worked when Thomas crossed the ball
over to me.''
	   The second goal, in the 58th minute, was also a well-crafted
piece of soccer. Joerg Heinrich chased down a long pass and
one-touched the ball right to Bierhoff, who one-timed his shot off
the left post. Klinsmann was there for the easy rebound, putting it
in with an acrobatic, diving header.
	   The game pitted Germany's methodical precision against Iran's
swift counterattacks. Iran came out with a defensive strategy,
choking the German offense and countering whenever possible.
	   Iranian goalkeeper Ahmad Abedzadeh didn't have a difficult save
in the first half, while counterpart Andreas Koepke had to dive to
his right to stop Karim Bagheri's 35-meter drive off a set play.
	   Iran stepped up the attack after falling behind, but Germany had
the better scoring chances. Bierhoff was just wide in the 60th and
also missed the target with a header in the 86th.
	   Klinsmann's goal was his eighth in World Cup first-round play.
He scored four times in Germany's three opening round games in the
United States four years ago, twice in the 1990 group matches in
Italy, and also netted in the Germans' France 98 opener.
	   Before the game, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met with
French police providing security at the stadium. Kinkel also
expressed his government's sympathy for French police officer
Daniel Nivel, who was beaten into a coma by German hooligans Sunday
after the Germany-Yugoslavia game in Lens.

	   Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly would not comment.
	   ``We've ... received a subpoena for Linda to appear before the
grand jury June 30th,'' Murtha said.
	   Starr forged ahead with his grand jury probe. His prosecutors
questioned senior presidential adviser Sidney Blumenthal before the
panel about his discussions inside the White House with first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
	   A grand jury is impaneled to allegations of criminal activity
and supporting evidence, then to issue indictments if warranted.
	   After spending most of the afternoon before the panel, Blumental
told reporters, ``If Starr is interested in the truth, he heard it
today.''
	   He also said:
	   ``I have answered the questions put to me truthfully. The
president shared his account of the Lewinsky matter with me
unguardedly and freely under the assumption that we were speaking
in complete privacy.
	   ``What I told the grand jury under oath supports what the
president has told the American people and is contrary to any
charge that the president has done anything wrong.''
	   His lawyer, William McDaniel, sounding bitter, said the
questions put to Blumenthal ``were sophomoric, silly, insulting to
the grand jury and insulting to this process and certainly
insulting to the president.''
	   The grand jury is investigating whether Clinton had a sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and
then urged her to lie about it.
	   Tripp, a former White House employee who moved to the Pentagon,
became friends with Ms. Lewinsky when the intern was transferred to
the Pentagon in the spring of 1996.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The bodies of 40 guerrillas and the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed in fighting in south Lebanon
returned home Thursday night, completing the first stage of a swap
between Israel and Lebanon.
	   Lebanon received the bodies of the Hezbollah fighters, including
the son of the guerrilla movement's leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah,
with full military honors late Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri led the ceremony at Beirut airport,
recognizing the Shiite Muslim militants as national heroes.
	   ``We welcome today, with all respect, the bodies of a group of
our martyred children who return to the land where they grew up,
whose freedom they fought for and died for,'' Hariri said.
	   Lebanese soldiers carried the 40 coffins, wrapped in the
Lebanese flag, out of the French military transport plane that had
flown them from Tel Aviv, Israel.
	   The bodies were to be buried on Friday.
	   Less than five hours earlier, Lebanon had loaded onto the same
aircraft the remains of Israeli Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya, a naval
commando killed in a botched raid in the south in September. Israel
received the remains with full honors at a military airport outside
Tel Aviv.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross mediated the
exchange. Red Cross delegate Jean-Jacques Fresard, who struck the
deal in 10 months of tortuous negotiations, oversaw the exchange,
traveling both ways on the 50-minute flight between Beirut and Tel
Aviv.
	   ``We brought back Itamar's remains to Israel and now we will
bring back 40 dead bodies to Lebanon so people will now have a
proper burial,'' Fresard said in Tel Aviv. ``This is going to make
a number of families extremely happy so, as a humanitarian
organization, we can only be satisfied by this.''
	   The second stage of the swap was scheduled Friday, when Israel
was to free 60 Lebanese prisoners at a crossing point in
Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon.
	   The exchange went ahead despite a guerrilla ambush earlier in
the day in the south that killed two Israeli soldiers and wounded
four others.
	   Ilya's remains arrived in iceboxes in Tel Aviv, where they were
identified by an army chaplain and placed into a coffin draped in
the national flag.
	   Six naval commandos in white caps carried the coffin to a
military ambulance. A funeral was planned Friday.
	   ``It's a mitzvah (Good deed) to return him to his family, to his
country,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said before Ilya's
body arrived.
	   Outside Beirut airport, scores of veiled women and bearded
Shiite men had waited for the coffins since the afternoon.
	   Zeinab Shehadeh hoped to know the fate of her guerrilla brother,
who was 24 when he disappeared in 1989 after he set off for an
attack on Israeli forces.
	   ``I'm waiting to see if he comes today,'' the 60-year-old woman
said. ``Otherwise, I will try tomorrow to look for him among the
released,'' she added.
	   She will be disappointed. Kamel Shehadeh's name was on neither
the list of those in coffins nor on the list of those to be
released Friday.

Arab League condemns Israel's plans to extend Jerusalem authority 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with U.S. reaction to Arab League request.
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League on Thursday condemned
Israel's decision to extend some Jerusalem municipal services to
West Bank settlements, calling it an attempt to ``eliminate the
Arab identity of east Jerusalem.''
	   The 22-member league also warned that the implementation of the
plans will ``destroy the (Middle East) peace process and put the
entire area on the brink.''
	   The meeting was called by the Palestinians to discuss an Israeli
blueprint for Jerusalem that would extend some services to Jewish
West Bank settlements _ a step the Palestinians fear will lead to
the annexation of West Bank land and choke off Arab parts of
Jerusalem from other Palestinian areas.
	   ``This is a very dangerous decision and will have grave
consequences,'' the league said.
	   Later Thursday, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid
met with the European Union envoy to the Middle East, Miguel
Moratinos, and asked him to intervene to stop the Israeli move.
	   Moratinos, who arrived in Cairo from Lebanon Thursday, told
reporters: ``The European Union rejects all unilateral measures
that contradict international law and international legitimacy,''
	   The league said it would ask the U.N. Security Council to
discuss the Israeli move.
	   But in Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin
said such discussion would be ``unhelpful.''
	   ``Any action in the security council would be counterproductive
to the success of our discussions with the Palestinians and the
Israelis,'' Rubin said.
	   The State Department has nevertheless criticized the Israeli
extension.
	   The Israeli Cabinet has said its decision is aimed at
strengthening ties between Jewish settlements and Jerusalem.

World Cup: Germany advances with 2-0 victory over Iran 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: optional
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Unspectacular, but effective.
	   Germany's vaunted pair of forwards, Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen
Klinsmann, scored on a pair of headers early in the second half,
using their supremacy in the air to power Germany into the second
round of the World Cup.
	   The 2-0 victory over Iran on Thursday lifted the Germans to the
top of Group F and a second-round meeting Monday with second-place
Group E finisher Mexico, also in Montpellier.
	   Germany thus avoided having to play powerhouse rival the
Netherlands, which won Group E. The Dutch will meet Yugoslavia,
which finished second to Germany on goal difference after beating
the United States 1-0 in Nantes. Both teams finished with seven
points.
	   ``We wanted to be first and we achieved our objective,'' German
coach Berti Vogts said. ``We can't choose our opponents and Mexico
has shined in this World Cup. There are no easy teams in the second
round.''
	   The two precision goals highlighted a workmanlike performance
for the European Champion, which is seeking its fourth World Cup
title.
	   ``We can't be happy with our first half, but we managed to open
up the game in the second,'' Vogts said.
	   Iran, which scored its first-ever World Cup victory over the
United States on Sunday, was eliminated, along with the Americans.
	   ``We played against a very experienced team, which is more
physical and better technically than us. But this World Cup was a
great experience for us and I hope it did a lot for the future of
soccer in our country,'' said Iranian coach Jalal Talebi.
	   The game pitted Germany's methodical precision against Iran's
swift counterattacks. Iran came out with a defensive strategy,
choking the German offense and countering whenever possible.
	   Iranian goalkeeper Ahmad Abedzadeh didn't have a difficult save
in the first half, while counterpart Andreas Koepke had to dive to
his right to stop Karim Bagheri's 35-meter drive off a set play.
	   The Germans stepped up the pace after the interval and it soon
paid off.
	   Thomas Haessler and Bierhoff, the combination that worked so
well when Germany won the European title two years ago, connected
again to open the scoring in the 50th minute.
	   Haessler made a clinical right-wing cross to Bierhoff, who left
defenders Mohammad Khakpour and Mehdi Pashazadeh bumping into each
other as his header bounced high into the net from eight meters.
	   ``We tried hard in the first halftime, but it didn't work,''
Bierhoff said. ``We were always afraid that Iran would somehow
score.''
	   ``We played better in the second half and after we scored the
first goal, things opened up a bit. We tried to come over the
flanks and cross and finally it worked when Thomas crossed the ball
over to me.''
	   The second goal, in the 58th minute, was also a well-crafted
piece of soccer. Joerg Heinrich chased down a long pass and
one-touched the ball right to Bierhoff, who one-timed his shot off
the left post. Klinsmann was there for the easy rebound, putting it
in with an acrobatic, diving header.
	   Klinsmann's goal was his eighth in World Cup first-round play.
He scored four times in Germany's three opening round games in the
United States four years ago, twice in the 1990 group matches in
Italy, and also netted in the Germans' France 98 opener.
	   Before the game, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met with
French police providing security at the stadium. Kinkel also
expressed his government's sympathy for French police officer
Daniel Nivel, who was beaten into a coma by German hooligans Sunday
after the Germany-Yugoslavia game in Lens.

World Cup: Yugoslavs struggle to 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with quotes.
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Slobodan Komljenovic headed in a rebound
off a free kick just over three minutes after the opening kickoff
Thursday night and Yugoslavia struggled to a 1-0 victory over the
United States in a World Cup match that turned out to be
meaningless for both sides.
	   The Americans, who already had been eliminated, merely were
playing for pride. As it turned out, so were the Yugoslavs, who
already had clinched a place in the second round, hoped for a big
victory to overtake Germany on goal difference and advance as the
winner from Group F.
	   But a 2-0 victory by Germany over Iran in Montpellier squelched
those hopes and the second half turned into a midfield quagmire.
	   The results mean the Yugoslavs will play the Netherlands in
Toulouse on Monday while Germany will get Mexico in Montpellier.
	   For the second straight game the match had political overtones
for the Americans, who were coming off a 2-1 loss to Iran.
	   It was also the second straight game the Americans dominated
possession early and hit the post quickly only to be frustrated.
	   Frankie Hejduk sent a falling cross that got over the head of
goalkeeper Ivica Kralj and struck the far post after 24 seconds,
but the Yugoslavs cleared and absorbed several American forays in
the first 45 minutes.
	   ``Goal scoring opportunities aren't easily created at the World
Cup, and goals have to be scored,'' said U.S. coach Steve Sampson.
``Precision in front of the goal is something we'll have to correct
if we want to get good results in the future.''
	   The Yugoslav goal came on its second shot and first threatening
chance in the U.S. half. Sinisa Mihalovic blasted a curling
35-meter free kick that American goalkeeper Brad Friedel two-handed
away, but the rebound bounced to Komljenovic, who despite standing
almost on the end line headed the ball back down behind a
recovering Friedel.
	   ``The Americans played well tonight, like in their previous two
matches,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said. ``But they simply
didn't convert their chances.''
	   The goal didn't seem to slow the Americans, who continued to
push forward and got a powerful header from the top of the box out
of Brian McBride that Kralj handled in the 15th minute.
	   Hejduk put another shot on goal with a scissors kick in the 25th
and the Americans generally created more chances than the
Yugoslavs.
	   ``We started well, but unfortunately we conceded an early
goal,'' Sampson said. ``Yugoslavia is an exceptional team that will
progress far at the World Cup and I'm proud of my players and their
game tonight.''
	   One of Yugoslav's serious chances came in the 28th minute when
Savo Milosevic blasted a shot from the right that Friedel had to
punch away.
	   Yugoslavia's star striker Predrag Mijatovic had to leave the
field in the 31st minute because of a knee injury. He was replaced
by 20-year-old Perica Ognjenovic, who wasted several Yugoslav
chances in the closing minutes of the match.
	   Santrac said he had to make the change because he didn't want to
risk Mijatovic worsening his injury ahead of the single-elimination
phase of the tournament.
	   The Yugoslavs slowed the American offense in the second half,
limiting them to a handful of serious chances, but not creating
much more themselves.
	   About the only excitement for either side came in the way of
substitutions. Yugoslavia saw AC Milan forward Dejan Savicevic for
the first time in two months and Yugoslav native Preki
Radosavljevic came on for the United States against his former
countrymen.
	   The match was being played at a time of high political tension
between the two nations. Richard Holbrooke, U.S. envoy to the
United Nations, was in Yugoslavia in a last-ditch attempt to end
fighting between Yugoslav security forces and ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo province.
	   The Clinton administration blames Yugoslavia's hardline
president Slobodan Milosevic for the conflict. Should the peace
effort fail, NATO could soon carry out air strikes against the
Yugoslav forces.
	   Yugoslav fans at the stadium chanted ``We won't give up
Kosovo.''

Eds: ADDS quote from German coach
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Germany, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands and Mexico
advanced to the second round of the World Cup on Thursday, and so
did an American referee whose controversial decision to award a
penalty earlier this week was vindicated by a Norwegian television
replay.
	   Germany qualified with a workmanlike 2-0 victory over Iran at
Montpellier, with Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scoring
early in the second half. The loss eliminated Iran.
	   Yugoslavia advanced on Slobodan Komljenovic's goal in a 1-0 win
over the United States at Nantes, although the small margin of
victory meant the Yugoslavs couldn't overtake the Germans for first
place in Group F.
	   ``We wanted to be first, and we achieved our objective,'' German
coach Berti Vogts said.
	   The Dutch and the Mexicans both stayed in the Cup after a 2-2
draw at Saint-Etienne, a game decided on Luis ``El Matador''
Hernandez' goal in the fifth minute of second-half injury time.
	   ``I am happy. It was an unbelievable game,'' said Hernandez, who
was a doubtful starter because of an ankle injury. ``It was a
fantastic game for us. A triumph for Mexico and the Mexican
people.''
	   While it was a thrilling finish _ Mexico was 2-0 down in the
75th minute _ the Mexicans needed to win for the game to make any
difference in either team's destiny in Group E. Belgium, the third
place team, eliminated itself by drawing 1-1 with South Korea at
Paris, so the Dutch won the group ahead of Mexico on goal
differential.
	   The results mean all four teams will be action Monday, with
Germany playing Mexico at Montpellier and the Netherlands facing
Yugoslavia at Toulouse.
	   Meanwhile, the chief of World Cup officiating defended his
embattled referees, including American Esse Baharmast, who awarded
the winning penalty kick to Norway in a 2-1 victory over Brazil on
Monday.
	   That result eliminated Morocco from the tournament and led to
charges Thursday from the African Football Confederation that the
continent had been victimized by ``one-sided'' refereeing and urged
FIFA to ``repair prejudice'' that resulted in the elimination of
African teams.
	   Initial replays of Baharmast's call showed contact but no clear
foul. But David Will, who runs FIFA's referee office, pointed to
photos taken from the Norwegian television network NRK that show
Brazil's Junior Baiano clearly grabbing the jersey of the Norwegian
player, Tore Andre Flo, in the penalty area.
	   ``The referee, from his angle, took a decision and played it as
he saw it, direct and straightforward,'' Will said. ``You can look
at television and photographs and pictures on the Internet. But at
the end of the day, the referee has to make a decision on the field
in a split second as he sees it.''
	   Baharmast and other referee whose call cost an African team a
chance to advance were picked Thursday for the officiating crews of
second-round World up games, albeit as substitutes. Baharmast and
Laszlo Vagner of Hungary, whose call nullified a crucial Cameroon
goal on Monday, could also be named as head referees for matches
later in the tournament.
	   Will said overall officiating in the Cup's first 40 games
averaged 8.3 points out of 10, and marks were getting better as the
tournament progressed. Most games were graded between 8 and 9 by
the officiating supervisors, he said.
	   ``We remain generally satisfied with the performance of the
referees,'' Will said. ``The overall standard remains high _ higher
than in the United States (in 1994), to be sure.''
	   Elsewhere, the fear of new World Cup violence was seen on the
streets of Leon, where bars closed and and schoolchildren planned
to stay home as the town prepares for Friday's England-Colombia
match.
	   Lens was hit by the World Cup's worst violence last Sunday when
German fans rampaged. A French policeman hit over the head by an
iron bar was left in a coma.
	   Fear of English soccer hooligans is running high. In addition,
many people dread a return of the Germans, who, according to
reports, might seek a confrontation Friday with the English.
	   ``You can understand their parents' fears,'' said primary school
teacher Evelyne Tumerelle, who said she was expecting said only
three of her 20 pupils to show up Friday.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
has announced alcohol restrictions. Officials banned its sale or
possession on the streets from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Germany's Interior Ministry toughened border checks, with 1,000
border guards deployed. By noon Thursday, more than 10,000
travelers had been checked. Fourteen suspected hooligans had their
passports seized.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying German extremists plan to travel to Lens ``to combat the
English enemy and try to gain the title of `best hooligans of
Europe.' ''

TV film of man's death wins critical praise 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A television film showing a man's death from
stomach cancer won praise on Thursday from reviewers who found it
sensitive and dignified.
	   ``I think it's immensely powerful and a deeply moving piece of
television,'' said Matthew Bond of The Daily Telegraph, who
previewed the film broadcast Thursday night.
	   Herbert Mowes, 63, who died April 9, 1997, permitted television
cameras to record his last breaths as part of a BBC series titled
``The Human Body.''
	   One tabloid newspaper column objected the day before the
broadcast, saying the no one should intrude on a man's death. ``A
man's deathbed, his last hour, is his alone, and to intrude upon it
is to rob his grave before he is in it,'' wrote Robert Robinson.
	   ``This chap's called Herbie,'' Bond said , and ``Herbie and his
wife had clearly thought long and hard about inviting the cameras
in. And you never got the sense of intruding.''
	   But, he told The Associated Press, ``the final 10 minutes, which
are very close to unwatchable, will have upset as many people as it
did reassure.''
	   Peter Waymark of The Times said the program was made ``with
complete sensitivity and dignity. I think nobody could possibly
take any objection to it.''
	   Mower, he told AP, ``felt it would just show people it wasn't
perhaps the distressing event that many fear. ''
	   Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent agreed it was ``very well
done. ''
	   Asked if people would be repelled by the subject, he said, ``It
was very clear the man involved was at peace, he wasn't
frightened.''
	   In the program, Mowes said, ``I know that I'll never see this
film in my lifetime but I like to think that everybody will see how
a human being can manage an illness like mine. ... Everybody can
see that there is a way to make the best of the end of your life.''
	   Mowes and his wife Hannelore moved from Frankfurt to Galway on
the west cost of Ireland 20 years ago. She said the project seemed
to help her husband. In an interview with The Sunday Times, she had
said the TV crew were good company and became friends.
	   The crew withdrew at the very end of Mowes' life, leaving the
cameras running while Mrs. Mowes cradled her husband in her arm,
talking softly to him in German.
	   Lord Winston, who is one of Britain's leading authorities on
fertility and presented the BBC series, wrote in The Times
newspaper that he was particularly moved by one scene in the
documentary in which a neighbor brings his 10-year-old daughter to
visit Mowes.
	   ``She thrusts into (his) hand a tiny bunch of wild flowers which
she has picked in the fields outside, and she and her father sing
him a little Irish folksong. ... The thing which stands out is this
girl's very lack of distress,'' Winston wrote.
	   ``It is, indeed, a lesson to all of us. In hiding death as we do
in our civilized society, we make it a taboo.''

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The bodies of 40 guerrillas and the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed in fighting in south Lebanon
returned home Thursday night, completing the first stage of a swap
between Israel and Lebanon.
	   Lebanon received the bodies of the mostly Hezbollah fighters,
including the son of the guerrilla movement's leader Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah, with full military honors at 11.10 pm (2010 GMT).
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri led the ceremony at Beirut airport,
a move that showed the government recognized the Shiite Muslim
militants as national heroes.
	   ``We welcome today, with all respect, the bodies of a group of
our martyred children who return to the land where they grew up,
whose freedom they fought for and died for,'' Hariri said.
	   Lebanese soldiers carried the 40 coffins, wrapped in the
Lebanese flag, out of the French military transport plane that had
flown them from Tel Aviv, Israel.
	   The bodies will be buried in a funeral Saturday.

Voters pick who will govern Northern Ireland into new era 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with exit poll grafs 3-7, 15; edits 2nd references to
parties throughout; RAISES context, graf 2
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Knowing that their choices
could make or break the peace agreement, Northern Ireland's voters
on Thursday selected the politicians who will govern their divided
land in a new Assembly.
	   Results for the 108-seat Assembly, the central plank of the
April 10 accord that most voters endorsed in a referendum last
month, won't be confirmed until late Friday or even Saturday.
	   But partly tabulated results from an exit poll were
disappointing for the Ulster Unionists, the north's major
pro-British Protestant party, whose backing for the agreement is
critical.
	   The poll of about 800 voters from early morning to mid-afternoon
across Northern Ireland indicated that the Ulster Unionists
received 20 percent of first-preference votes, compared with 19
percent for the main opponent of the agreement, Ian Paisley's
Democratic Unionists.
	   Commissioned by the Irish national broadcasters RTE and the
Irish Times newspaper, the data had a margin of error of about 5
percentage points. Political analysts cautioned against taking the
figures at face value.
	   They excluded data collected from 3 p.m. until Northern
Ireland's 1,228 polling stations closed at 10 p.m. (2100gmt), when
many working, middle-class people voted. Also, the figures don't
take into account the complex possibilities of the ``proportional
representation'' system, which allowed voters to list their second,
third and lower choices on the ballot paper.
	   The RTE/Irish Times poll indicated that the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party attracted 25 percent of first-preference
votes, compared with 13 percent for the IRA-allied Sinn Fein. If
that result is confirmed, it would be the first time in history
that a Catholic party had topped a vote in Northern Ireland.
	   The implications for the peace process couldn't be higher in
this election, which begins the process of returning government
power from London back to Belfast after a bloody generation.
	   Unlike the previous Protestant-dominated parliament that the
British government abolished in 1972, the new Assembly is designed
to ensure that neither Protestants nor Catholics can impose their
will on the other side.
	   ``The guiding spirit of our agreement means that there can be no
victories by either side, because in a divided society, victories
are not solutions,'' SDLP leader John Hume, a prime architect of
the successful negotiations, said after voting in his native
Londonderry.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, whose party has seen its support
surge since the Irish Republican Army's abortive 1994 cease-fire,
predicted that Sinn Fein would win 17 to 20 seats.
	   Hume and Adams are united in support for the agreement. By
contrast the leaders of the Protestant majority are bitterly
divided over the deal, particularly the prospect of sharing power
with Sinn Fein.
	   Two hard-line parties _ both of which boycotted the talks once
Sinn Fein gained admission after the IRA renewed its cease-fire in
July 1997 _ are running on a promise to obstruct key functions of
the Assembly.
	   ``Come Friday the world will see what the Protestant people
really think of this so-called peace process, which is really a
surrender process,'' said Paisley, who estimates that Protestants
opposed to the agreement will need to win about 30 seats in the
Assembly to block decisions.
	   The Ulster Unionists ran the most candidates at 48. But at least
six are publicly opposed to their leader David Trimble's acceptance
of the agreement.
	   But hopes for a peaceful future mixed with the realities of the
latest car bomb. Many voters in the village of Newtownhamilton, its
main street of shops and homes badly damaged in Wednesday's blast,
said they were too busy picking up the pieces of their shattered
property to vote.
	   A small anti-British gang, the Irish National Liberation Army,
claimed responsibility.
	   For the village's minority of Protestant residents, the attack
illustrated why they're so opposed to compromise with IRA
supporters.
	   ``We've given these people every chance in the world to come
into democratic politics, and they still bomb us,'' said Andrea
Clark, a Protestant woman sweeping glass and plaster out of her
boarded-up bakery.
	   Last year her home in nearby Markethill was wrecked when IRA
dissidents set off another car bomb.
	   ``When you offer to give them half a loaf, they just go on
asking for the whole loaf anyway,'' she said.

NBA agenda: draft over, lockout looms AP Basketball Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ The first-round picks, the
agents and the commissioner all headed to the airport and went
their separate ways Thursday. A busy draft night was over and a
summer of labor strife loomed.
	   ``There will be a lockout unless a miracle takes place, which
probably won't happen,'' players' union director Billy Hunter said
Thursday.
	   There was no optimism from the owners, either, as the league was
preparing to shut down for a work stoppage that could extend well
into the fall.
	   Negotiations broke off earlier this week, and no new ones are
scheduled before the collective bargaining agreement expires at
midnight, June 30.
	   The stalemate in the labor dispute was in sharp contrast to the
wheeling and dealing surrounding Wednesday night's draft.
	   Thursday's trade of Charles Oakley from the New York Knicks to
the Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby brought to eight the number of
deals in less than 24 hours.
	   Among others changing locations were Nick Van Exel, who went
from the Lakers to the Nuggets, and Steve Nash, who was dealt from
Phoenix to Dallas.
	   Of the 58 draftees, 12 changed teams before all the trading was
completed.
	   ``It's not something that normal people go through, but it's a
lot of fun,'' said Pat Garrity of Notre Dame, who was selected 19th
by Milwaukee, traded to Dallas and then sent to Phoenix in a
three-way deal. ``It's unbelievable to come here and know that when
you leave, you're going to be headed somewhere for the next three
to five years. And then to be placed in three different cities,
it's just crazy.''
	   Some would say plunging headfirst into a labor war would be
crazy, too, especially with the league coming off a finals between
Chicago and Utah that drew the highest television ratings in NBA
history.
	   But that seems what's ahead, leaving questions about the future
of Michael Jordan and the Bulls, among others, unanswered for the
foreseeable future.
	   Commissioner David Stern flew to Oakland, Calif., after the
draft to announce the awarding of the 2000 All-Star Game to the
Golden State Warriors, while Hunter flew to Las Vegas for the
union's annual golf outing.
	   Neither side had plans for resumption of negotiations, and the
Board of Governors was to speak by conference call Monday to give a
final go-ahead for the lockout.
	   If it is imposed July 1, as expected, there's little chance of a
quick resolution. The union's executive council is headed to Hawaii
after the July 4 weekend for a meeting, meaning it won't be able to
bargain with the league until July 12 at the earliest.
	   The sides have made almost no progress in two months of talks,
remaining far apart on several issues including a hard salary cap,
a rookie wage scale and a new drug agreement.

Italian court gives 23-year term in Florida slaying 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TARANTO, Italy (AP) _ A court here, trying an Italian-born
restaurateur whom Italy refused to extradite, on Thursday convicted
the man of slaying a Florida tax-collector and gave him a 23-year
prison term, Italian news reports said.
	   Pietro Venezia was accused of fatally shooting Donald Bonham on
Christmas Eve day 1993 in Miami after the revenue agent had frozen
Venezia's bank account to cover dlrs 48,000 in back taxes.
	   Venezia was tried here after the Italian government refused to
let Florida have him after he was captured in Italy in 1994. Italy,
which does not have the death penalty, rebuffed the extradition
request for fear he would be executed.
	   Italy's stiffest jail term is life in prison, the punishment
sought by the prosecutors.
	   Venezia insisted the gun accidentally went off during a fight.
	   In the courtroom in this southeastern Italian city to hear the
verdict Thursday evening was a sister and a son of Bonham, the
Italian news agency AGI reported.
	   Bonham was handling the case of Venezia's Ristorante Buccione, a
trendy Coconut Grove place, which had lost money and fell behind in
taxes.
	   Venezia disappeared two days after the slaying.
	   In 1996, Italy's highest court ruled that the U.S.-Italy
extradition treaty did not offer Venezia enough protection from the
death penalty, even though American prosecutors had promised not to
seek execution.

Predators' goal in draft: goalies AP Hockey Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By KEN RAPPOPORT
<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ The Nashville Predators hope to follow
the lead of the Florida Panthers in the National Hockey League
expansion draft. Actually, they have little choice.
	   General manager David Poile, preparing to turn his paper NHL
team into one of flesh and blood, thinks his team can be in good
shape if it gets capable goalies and defensemen in Friday's draft.
	   ``The pattern for most expansion teams is strong goaltending and
defense,'' he said. ``Of course, that may be by default because
it's so hard to get big scorers.''
	   The Predators could do a lot worse than the Panthers. They came
into the NHL in the 1993-94 season and in three years were in the
Stanley Cup finals. The strength of that team was goaltending,
defense and leadership.
	   ``I will probably take five goaltenders,'' Poile said. ``Not
only goaltending for the Predators, but assets I can trade after
the draft. Our goaltenders could probably be our best assets.''
	   Under draft rules, the Predators will take one player from each
of the NHL's other 26 teams _ 13 forwards, eight defensemen, three
goalies and two others at any other position.
	   After the expansion draft, the Predators will finish their
business at Saturday's NHL entry draft of amateur players.
	   Some of the better goaltenders available in the expansion draft
are New Jersey's Mike Dunhamn, Anaheim's Mikhail Shtalenkov and
Chicago's Chris Terreri.
	   Such goalies as Bill Ranford, Eric Fichaud, Steve Shields and
Kay Whitmore already have changed teams in trades since the end of
the season.
	   Most notable was Ranford, a Conn Smythe winner as playoff MVP
with Edmonton in 1990. He was traded by Stanley Cup finalist
Washington to Tampa Bay for a third-round pick in the entry draft
and a second-rounder next year.
	   Dunham reportedly is one of the players that interest Poile,
along with Washington forward Andrew Burnette. He has also
favorably mentioned such forwards as Detroit's Doug Brown,
Buffalo's Dixon Ward and Boston's Mike Sullivan.
	   Some of the well-known veterans available are Philadelphia's
Paul Coffey, Carolina's Kevin Dineen, New Jersey's Steve Thomas and
Toronto's Derek King.
	   In Saturday's entry draft, the Predators will have the third
pick behind Tampa Bay and San Jose. By that time, Vincent
Lecavalier figures to be long gone. He's the consensus No. 1 pick
from the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League tabbed as the ``next
Mario Lemieux.''

Ambassador sees smoother relations between Colombia and the United States 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador on Thursday
predicted ``an excellent relationship'' with the incoming
administration of Andres Pastrana after four years of tumultuous
ties due to Colombia's alleged poor cooperation in the war on
drugs.
	   Sunday's election of Pastrana, who replaces President Ernesto
Samper, is ``a great achievement of Colombian democracy,''
Ambassador Curtis Kamman said after meeting briefly with the
president-elect.
	   Colombia's ties with the United States deteriorated under
Samper.
	   The Clinton Administration revoked Samper's visa in 1996,
convinced he knew about a dlrs 6 million contribution from drug
traffickers to his 1994 presidential campaign. Colombia was also
decertified as an ally in the war on drugs in 1996 and 1997.
	   Colombia produces 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United
States and is a growing source of heroin.
	   Pastrana, a 44-year-old former television journalist and Bogota
mayor, won in a runoff against Samper's handpicked successor and
former interior minister, Horacio Serpa of the Liberal Party.
	   Pastrana, who represents the Conservative Party, claims to have
good ties with Democrats and Republicans in Washington and said he
would visit the U.S. capital before taking office in August.

Hawks center indicted on federal drug charges 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JACKSON, Mississippi (AP) _ Center Greg Anderson, who played for
the National Basketball Association's Atlanta Hawks last season,
was indicted by a federal grand jury on four drug and money
laundering charges, federal prosecutors confirmed Thursday.
	   U.S. Attorney Brad Pigott said in a statement that Anderson, 34,
a 10-year NBA veteran and currently a free agent, was accused of
two counts of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, one
count of money laundering and one criminal forfeiture count.
	   Authorities refused to say whether Anderson was in custody or
being sought by FBI agents. He lives in Pearland, Texas.
	   Announcement of the indictment came after an FBI official,
testifying Wednesday before the House International Relations
Committee in Washington, disclosed that a Hawks player had been
arrested on narcotics charges. He did not identify the player.
	   ``Just yesterday,'' Thomas Kneir, deputy assistant director of
the FBI's criminal investigations division, told lawmakers, ``We
arrested a NBA player on a narcotics charge, a center for the
Atlanta Hawks.''
	   The FBI refused Wednesday to elaborate on Kneir's statement,
referring all questions to the U.S. attorney's office in Jackson.
Prosecutors in that office also refused to comment until Pigott's
statement was released late Thursday.
	   Pigott said Anderson was charged in a sealed indictment returned
Wednesday by a grand jury in Gulf Port, Mississippi.
	   Anderson played college ball at Houston. He was a No. 1 draft
pick of San Antonio in 1987 and played for Milwaukee, New Jersey,
Denver and Detroit before signing with the Hawks as a free agent.
	   He has career averages of 7.3 points and 6.2 rebounds a game.
Last season with the Hawks, he played in 50 games and averaged 1.8
points and 2.4 rebounds.

Lindros signs one-year deal with Flyers 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ The Philadelphia Flyers signed Eric Lindros
to an dlrs 8.5 million, one-year contract extension, avoiding the
embarrassment of having their marquee player on the restricted free
agent list as the signing period begins.
	   Lindros, whose original signing with the Flyers in 1992 provides
a study in contract disputes and arbitration, faxed a signed copy
of the deal for 1998-99 to the team Wednesday night. The team
expected to receive the originals Thursday.
	   ``We're pleased to confirm that we have received Eric's
signature on his contract,'' Flyers lawyer Phil Weiberg said
Thursday. The signature had been delayed by ``a number of wording
issues ... lawyerly stuff that doesn't go to the basic
understanding,'' he said.
	   The Flyers plan to forward the contract to the National Hockey
League's central registry, enabling Lindros to be removed from a
list of restricted free agents.
	   Lindros, represented by his father, Carl, agreed in December to
the contract extension that also increased his salary for 1997-98.
	   The Flyers got Lindros from the Quebec Nordiques in 1992 for six
players, two draft choices and dlrs 15 million. Lindros, the
Nordiques No. 1 pick, said he wouldn't play in Quebec. The deal had
to be approved by an arbitrator because Quebec owner Marcel Aubut
had also made a tentative trade with the New York Rangers.

Larry Nelson quietly doing his thing AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
	   CLIFTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Name the leading players on the
Senior PGA Tour and there's a good chance Larry Nelson won't be on
many lists.
	   It's something Nelson has come to expect.
	   Despite winning 10 PGA Tour tournaments, including three majors
_ two PGA titles and a U.S. Open _ Nelson has been overlooked
throughout his career.
	   ``Had I done in the '90s what I did in the '80s, it would be a
different story,'' Nelson said Thursday after shooting a
5-under-par 67 on the Upper Montclair Country Club in his final
practice for the dlrs 1.1 million Cadillac NFL Golf Classic, which
starts Friday.
	   With the popularity of golf now, Nelson would be more well known
with three major titles. That was a different time, though.
	   ``There is a difference between being slighted and other people
being put in front of you,'' Nelson said. ``I think there have been
more notable people with less credentials and that has nothing to
do with me. ... It doesn't bother me cause I did everything I
wanted.''
	   Nelson, 50, is now enjoying his first full year on the Senior
Tour. The rail-thin Georgian has won twice and finished in the Top
10 in seven of the 12 events he has competed. His dlrs 843,528 is
No. 3 on the tour's earnings list this year and his 70.15 scoring
average also is third.
	   Besides Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan, Nelson is the only other
multiple winner on the tour.
	   ``I am getting a little more accustomed to the Senior Tour,''
said Nelson, who joined the 50-and-over crowd in September. ``There
is a difference playing three rounds as opposed to four. You can't
afford to shoot yourself out of it in the first round and have a
chance to win.''
	   The biggest adjustment for Nelson since joining the seniors has
been getting used to the new courses and tournament locations.
	   After landing at Newark International Airport this week, Nelson
had to stop three times to ask for directions to his hotel, which
wasn't far away.
	   ``It's worse (than being a rookie), because you feel like you
should know where you are going,'' Nelson said.
	   Once on the golf course, Nelson has no problems.
	   ``I think I am as competitive as I ever was,'' Nelson said. ``I
think when I walk down the 18th hole I feel the same things I felt
in '79. That's the reason why we are all out here, for that feeling
when you walk down the fairway.
	   ``Not for the cheers of the crowd, but that excitement inside,
knowing you have to hit a certain shot and being able to do it.
It's the reason why I'm here.''
	   Besides Nelson, only three other members of the Senior Tour's
Top 10 money leaders are playing in this 54-hole event, which is
being held in conjunction with a tournament for NFL players. Jay
Sigel, Dave Stockton and Dana Quigley, who tied for second in last
week's AT and T Canada Senior Open, are the other Top 10 players
competing.
	   The defending champion is Bruce Crampton, who beat Hugh Baiocchi
in a playoff.

World Bank approves humanitarian aid for India 
</HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank approved more than dlrs 543
million in aid Thursday for a state in India, just weeks after the
bank postponed dlrs 1 billion in loans because of its nuclear
tests.
	   The United States voted to support the assistance package, even
though it was behind the bank's decision not to grant loans this
month that India requested.
	   Because the aid is for basic human needs and targets the poorest
in the state, Andhra Pradesh, it falls under an exemption to U.S.
sanctions imposed on India after their nuclear explosions, said a
U.S. Treasury Department spokeswoman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Aid packages that address education, health and nutrition among
the poorest segments of a population meet the criteria for
humanitarian relief.
	   ``Loans in those categories will continue to go forward,'' the
spokeswoman said.
	   The assistance package for Andhra Pradesh includes help in
health education, nutrition and rural development, the bank said in
a statement that did not refer to the nuclear question. As part of
a new state-level lending operation, the money will target the
poorest of Andhra Pradesh's 73 million people while helping the
state shift its spending toward providing basic resources.
	   About 30 percent of Andhra Pradesh's people live below the
poverty line. The literacy rate is 44 percent.
	   ``Andhra Pradesh has demonstrated a strong commitment to reforms
and has taken important steps to address pressing fiscal and sector
difficulties,'' said Edwin Lim, World Bank country director for
India. Andhra Pradesh will be the first to benefit from the bank's
new type of state-focused lending.
	   The decision to provide the aid comes several weeks after the
World Bank, at the urging of the United States and other countries,
put on hold more than a dlrs 1 billion in loans to India. Among
projects it foresaw were a renewable energy program, a national
power grid, an agricultural program and a highway project.
	   The cutoff was spurred by underground nuclear explosions
detonated by the Indians in a series that began May 11. Indian
spokesmen claim at least five devices were exploded.
	   The bank's assistance package of dlrs 543.2 million will go
toward the dlrs 830 million costs of the project to promote several
key areas of development in Andhra Pradesh. Its goals include:
	   _Ensuring that children complete a five-year primary education
cycle in areas with low literacy levels.
	   _Upgrading health centers and providing training to health
workers in the states poorest districts. The project also supports
using state campaigns to offer information on AIDS, malaria,
tuberculosis and nutrition.
	   _Providing immunization and nutritional services for preschool
children, pregnant and nursing women and predominantly poor
segments of the population.
	   _Helping farmers with irrigation management and cost recovery.
	   _Financing the operation and maintenance of rural roads and
highways.

Brooke further fans fiery buildup 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ All Black vice-captain Robin Brooke
further inflamed a tense buildup to Saturday's second rugby test
against England by accusing the tourists of taking cheap shots on
the field.
	   England was seething after prop Danny Grewcock was sent off and
given a five-game ban for stomping in last week's first test loss
while All Blacks veteran Ian Jones escaped penalty after being
cited for a similar offense.
	   England's assistant coach John Mitchell claimed Thursday that
there was a place for violence off the ball in rugby, but had his
comments diluted by team manager Roger Uttley.
	   ``There's a time and place to deal with the opposition (on the
field) and as we know in rugby there is place for it, but you have
to be very, very careful and not get caught,'' Mitchell said.
	   That was seen as an admission of guilt by Brooke.
	   ``They took cheap shots all the time and they got away with
it,'' Brooke said Friday. ``You just can't afford to retaliate
because you get caught by the referee or the touch judges or the
camera. It's not worth it.''
	   Mitchell, in charge while Clive Woodward attends his father's
funeral, has called up prop David Sims, to replace Grewcock,
debutant Jos Baxendell, Tom Beim and Tony Diprose. Beim scored his
first try on debut last week while Diprose was captain in the
record 76-0 loss to Australia a fortnight earlier.
	   Tim Stimpson and Steve Ojomoh were dropped, with inside center
Baxendell and fly-half Josh Lewsey expected to alternate roles in
attack and defense.
	   ``I think we have got a big chance of being competitive,
especially if we play for 80 minutes with 15 men,'' said Mitchell.
``We need controlled fury out there on Saturday, but there is no
need to go outside the laws. Rugby is a physical game, and things
will happen, yet we need to be careful.''
	   While New Zealand won the first test 64-22 and look capable of
another record score, Mitchell believes England is capable of an
upset.
	   ``We paid New Zealand too much respect at Carisbrook, so we've
got to cut out the unforced errors and concentrate hard,'' said
Mitchell.
	   The All Blacks have called up center Caleb Ralph for his debut.
	   Likely teams:
	   England: Matt Perry, Tom Beim, Nick Beal, Jos Baxendell, Austin
Healey, Josh Lewsey, Matt Dawson (captain), Tony Diprose, Pat
Sanderson, Dave Sims, Gareth Archer, Ben Clarke, Graham Rowntree,
Richard Cockerill, Phil Vickery. Reserves: Scott Benton, Steve
Ravenscroft, Tim Stimpson, Rob Fidler, Will Green, Phil Greening,
Steve Ojomoh.
	   New Zealand: Christian Cullen, Jeff Wilson, Caleb Ralph, Mark
Mayerhofler, Jonah Lomu, Andrew Mehrtens, Ofisa Tonu'u, Taine
Randell (captain), Josh Kronfeld, Robin Brooke, Ian Jones, Todd
Blackadder, Olo Brown, Anton Oliver, Craig Dowd. Reserves: Joeli
Vidiri, Carlos Spencer, Mark Robinson, Blair Larsen, Mark Carter,
Carl Hoeft, Norm Hewitt.

Iranians saddened by loss to Germany and exit from the World Cup UPDATES and RECASTS with Iranian reaction after defeat; no pickup 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian soccer fans took the defeat of their
World Cup team with good grace Thursday night, disappointed that
Germany had won 2-0 but not devastated.
	   ``The team didn't play bad and such a result for a team with
little experience against one of the best teams in the world is not
too bad,'' said Mousa Alavi, a young man walking home after the
match ended at 1:30 a.m. local time (2100 GMT).
	   Germany's victory in the southern French town of Montpellier
meant that Iran had been knocked out of the World Cup in the first
round.
	   The defeat came only four days after Iran's triumphant 2-1 win
over the United States, a game charged with political significance
born of the hostility between Washington and Tehran since the
Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   While the game against the United States triggered an all-night
party in the streets here, Thursday's match led to clusters of
people walking home from friends' houses in a resigned mood.
	   ``We will warmly welcome the team (home) because, compared with
other Asian teams, they played much better,'' said Mehvi Sedaqat.
`` They lost two matches, but that's football.''
	   Shahla Emami, a young woman walking home with her family, said
she too would go to Tehran airport to greet the team: ``This result
is not shameful.''
	   Before the match, Iranian ambitions ran sky-high with fans
hoping that their side would deliver a stunning upset by beating
the Germans, the current European champions and a team fancied to
win the Cup.
	   Squads of teenagers took to the streets of the capital before
the game began, shouting ``IRAN'' and blowing whistles. Passing
motorists joined in the clamor, honking their horns in support of
the demanded victory.
	   During the first half, Iran played so well that a win seemed
possible. The Tehran authorities sent thousands of traffic police
on to the streets in anticipation of wild celebrations.
	   But it was not to be. Early in the second half, German strikers
Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scored goals in quick
succession and Iran never managed a comeback.
	   Yet some Iranians still found cause for national pride. Several
cars drove home with passengers waving the green, white and red
flag. One vehicle had a man waving a flag on the one side and
another man blowing a plastic trumpet on the other side.

World Cup: Yugoslavs struggle to 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Optional.
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Yugoslavia said it wanted a big victory.
It settled for a humble 1-0 win.
	   Apparently abandoning its hopes for a match against the
thought-to-be easier Mexicans in the second round instead of the
Dutch, Yugoslavia got a fourth-minute goal from Slobodan
Komljenovic and then struggled for 45 minutes before finally
closing out the United States in a match that turned out to be
meaningless for both.
	   ``We wanted to win an end the qualifications with a victory and
that was our only aim,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
``The game was not flamboyant, I know, but that is how you play
good matches.''
	   The Yugoslavs entered the game tied on points in Group F with
Germany, but trailing on goal difference. With Germany playing Iran
(and eventually winning 2-0), it needed a big victory over the
United States to overtake the Germans and win the group.
	   After Komljenovic's goal, and a surprisingly motivated Americans
looking to salvage pride after losses to Germany and Iran, the
Yugoslavs managed to hold on through the first half, and then
stifled the United States the rest of the way to get through.
	   ``We did what we had to do, win a match,'' Yugoslav captain
Dragan Stojkovic said. ``The Americans have such high motives to
beat us, but we are much a stronger team and we controlled the
match throughout.''
	   Actually, except for the goal, the first half belonged to the
Americans. Frankie Hejduk hit the post 24 seconds after the opening
kickoff and the United States kept the ball in Yugoslavia's half
for most the 45 minutes.
	   Yugoslavia's goal came on its first possession deep into the
U.S. half.
	   Sinisa Mihalovic blasted a curling 35-meter free kick that
American goalkeeper Brad Friedel palmed away, but the rebound
bounced to defender Slobodan Komljenovic, who despite standing
almost on the end line headed the ball back down behind a
recovering Friedel.
	   The goal didn't seem to slow the Americans, who continued to
push forward and got a powerful header from the top of the box out
of Brian McBride that Kralj handled in the 15th minute.
	   Hejduk put another shot on goal with a scissors kick in the 25th
and the Americans generally created more chances than the
Yugoslavs.
	   ``Goal scoring opportunities aren't easily created at the World
Cup, and goals have to be scored,'' said U.S. coach Steve Sampson.
``Precision in front of the goal is something we'll have to correct
if we want to get good results in the future.''
	   The Yugoslavs slowed the American offense in the second half,
limiting them to a handful of serious chances, but not creating
much more themselves.
	   ``We played a tactical game,'' said Yugoslavian forward Predrag
Mijatovic, who limped out of the game in the 31st minute. ``We
didn't want to push very hard ahead of the more important match
against the Netherlands.
	   ``We scored a goal early and since I felt the pain in my knee
when I was warming up, I didn't want to stay in the game because I
didn't want to risk anything.''
	   The results mean the Yugoslavs will play the Netherlands in
Toulouse on Monday while Germany will get Mexico in Montpellier.

TV film of man's death wins critical praise 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: ADDS in graf 12 that it's too early for viewer reaction;
clarifies in graf 4 that Robinson's from Evening Standard; UPPICKS

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A television film showing a man's death from
stomach cancer won praise on Thursday from reviewers who found it
sensitive and dignified.
	   ``I think it's immensely powerful and a deeply moving piece of
television,'' said Matthew Bond of The Daily Telegraph, who
previewed the film broadcast Thursday night.
	   Herbert Mowes, 63, who died April 9, 1997, permitted television
cameras to record his last breaths as part of a BBC series titled
``The Human Body.''
	   One tabloid newspaper column objected the day before the
broadcast, saying that no one should intrude on a man's death. ``A
man's deathbed, his last hour, is his alone, and to intrude upon it
is to rob his grave before he is in it,'' wrote Robert Robinson of
the Evening Standard.
	   ``This chap's called Herbie,'' Bond said , and ``Herbie and his
wife had clearly thought long and hard about inviting the cameras
in. And you never got the sense of intruding.''
	   But, he told The Associated Press, ``the final 10 minutes, which
are very close to unwatchable, will have upset as many people as it
did reassure.''
	   Peter Waymark of The Times said the program was made ``with
complete sensitivity and dignity. I think nobody could possibly
take any objection to it.''
	   Mower, he told AP, ``felt it would just show people it wasn't
perhaps the distressing event that many fear. ''
	   Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent agreed it was ``very well
done. ''
	   Asked if people would be repelled by the subject, he said, ``It
was very clear the man involved was at peace, he wasn't
frightened.''
	   In the program, Mowes said, ``I know that I'll never see this
film in my lifetime but I like to think that everybody will see how
a human being can manage an illness like mine. ... Everybody can
see that there is a way to make the best of the end of your life.''
	   A BBC spokeswoman said it was too early to gauge public reaction
to the program late Thursday because the department responsible for
taking calls from viewers had closed down for the night before the
program aired.

Fear of vigilantes halts return of refugees in southern Mexico 
</HEADLINE>

By TRINA KLEIST
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOS CHORROS, Mexico (AP) _ A dramatic homecoming for 850
refugees was canceled Thursday because of lingering fears over the
ongoing political strife in southern Chiapas state.
	   Members of the Las Abejas community had hoped to return home,
but said they still feared the pro-government vigilante groups that
murdered 45 people at one of their meetings in December.
	   Thousands of members of Las Abejas, a church-inspired community
group, last year fled homes in Los Chorros due to threats from
pro-government groups who considered them sympathetic to the
Zapatista National Liberation Army, which rebelled in 1994.
	   Thousands of others have fled threats or attacks in other towns
of Chiapas state, which is divided among government and rebel
supporters.
	   Apparently angry over the killing of a pro-government villager,
a vigilante group based largely in Los Chorros attacked Las Abejas
members as they left a church in the village of Acteal on Dec. 22.
Forty-five people were killed, many of them refugees, according to
federal prosecutors.
	   Las Abejas announced early this month 850 would try to return
home. Government and human rights groups said they had been assured
they would be welcomed.
	   On Thursday the returnees formed a column 500 yards (meters)
long at Crucero Majomut. They halted after their leader said they
had learned officials planned to demand they swear allegiance to
Mexico's ruling party, known as the PRI, or demand that those
arrested for the massacre be freed.
	   ``The mayor told me that if Las Abejas was going to return, they
would have to do it as PRI members,'' said Las Abejas member
Antonio Santiz Perez.
	   As Las Abejas members began turning back at midday, women a few
miles (kilometers) away in the village of Yibeljoj were still
cooking beans they have prepared to welcome them _ and wept as they
stirred in the galvanized metal tubs.
	   In Los Chorros, about five miles (8 kms) by rutted, rocky dirt
road from Crucero Majomut, hundreds of people had turned out to
welcome the returnees.
	   A man who gave his name only as ``Tommy'' said PRI leaders had
refused to let them open the church to welcome the returnees and
said village leaders were still demanding money to support the
vigilantes.
	   ``Sometimes we don't have enough food,'' he said. ``Sometimes we
eat only tortillas and chiles. But we have to seek loans at
interest because if we do not cooperate, they take us to jail.''
	   Mayor Pedro Mariano Perez Arias denied there were conditions on
the returnees and said no vigilante or paramilitary groups were
active.
	   ``I am also against the paramilitaries,'' said Perez Arias, who
also had denied the existence of vigilante groups before the Acteal
massacre.
	   The municipal agent for Los Chorros, Pedro Perez, insisted there
were no vigilante groups in Los Chorros.

Convicted Salvadoran guard says nuns' murder was ordered by higher ups

	   QUEZALTEPEQUE, El Salvador (AP) _ One of five former El Salvador
national guardsmen imprisoned in the rapes and murders of four
American church workers said Thursday that the 1980 attack was
ordered by ``higher-ups.''
	   ``They gave us the order while we were driving along. One had to
obey and nothing more,'' Daniel Canales told The Associated Press
in one of the few prison interviews he has given. He spoke a day
after a judge ordered parole for him and two other of the
guardsmen.
	   Canales insisted he was innocent. ``I did not take part. I
didn't see anything, because the night was very dark.''
	   He repeatedly refused to say who gave the order to kill the
women. Some of the other guardsmen sentenced in the attack have
made similar accusations _ also without providing names.
	   Roman Catholic nuns Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel and Maura Clark and
lay worker Jean Donovan had been driving along a Salvadoran road
when they were kidnapped, raped and shot dead on Dec. 2, 1980.
	   All four charity workers had been on a blacklist of suspected
leftist sympathizers _ as were many church people _ kept by
rightist death squads who helped the military fight the guerrillas.
	   Human rights groups estimated more than 75,000 people were
killed in the 14-year civil war that ended in 1993. They said most
of the victims were killed by the death squads.
	   Canales said that as a member of the Salvadoran National Guard
he was just another government soldier fighting a bloody war
against leftist guerrillas.
	   ``I was a soldier who had to be obedient, educated to suffer in
silence even at the cost of my own life,'' he said.
	   Referring bitterly to higher-ranking officers, Canales said:
``All the while, they are enjoying benefits and unmerited survival.
It was something inhuman, because they (the church workers) were
messengers in the name of God and were working for the welfare of
the least protected people.''
	   A U.N. investigating team has contended that Col. Eugenio Vides
Casanova, then-director of the National Guard, and Defense Minister
Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia at least covered up for higher-ups
involved.
	   The killings of the four church women raised an international
outcry. Under fierce pressure from the United State, which was
supplying El Salvador with massive military at aid at the time, the
military ordered the five guardsmen arrested.
	   The five were tried, convicted and sentenced to 30 years in
prison at Quezaltepeque, 15 miles (25 kms) northwest of San
Salvador. Under a new law, the men may be paroled because they have
served two-thirds of their time, counting time off for good
behavior.
	   A criminal court judge ruled Wednesday that Canales and two
others, Luis Colindres and Jose Roberto Moreno are eligible for
parole. The remaining two, Orlando Contreras and Carlos Joaquin,
however, must remain imprisoned due to misconduct while in jail.

Balcony collapses at wrestling meet, killing 22

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Wrestlers and spectators frantically lifted huge
chunks of concrete to try to save people crushed beneath a balcony
that collapsed at a meet Thursday in southern Russia, killing 22
people.
	   Thirty-nine others were injured as the 160-foot-long
(48-meter-long) balcony packed with more than 100 people _ mostly
children _ fell with a roar 16 feet (5 meters) onto the crowded
floor at the Russian National Freestyle Wrestling Competition in
the city of Nalchik.
	   The two wrestlers on the mat at the time stood up and stared in
disbelief at the collapsed balcony, which had been festooned with a
red banner saying, ``Welcome participants of the competition!''
	   A dozen people frantically scrambled off a small part of the
balcony that remained standing. TV footage showed several others
hanging onto windows adjacent to the balcony.
	   ``People started screaming,'' said sports journalist Vladimir
Sherbakov. ``There was panic, but everybody's first reaction was
shock.''
	   Other wrestlers and spectators rushed to help people trapped
under huge pieces of concrete.
	   ``Within 10 minutes the wrestlers had lifted the fallen pieces
off and freed the people underneath,'' Sherbakov said.
	   At least four cranes were brought to the scene, including one
that was driven inside the hall to help lift heavy debris.
	   The dead were carried outside and covered with sheets.
	   The accident occurred in the Trudovye Rezervy indoor sports
complex in Nalchik, about 850 miles (1,360 kilometers) south of
Moscow in the Kabardino-Balkaraya republic. About 2,500 people were
watching the competition.
	   Sherbakov described the balcony as a standing-room-only area
where non-paying spectators could watch the event. As a result,
most of those on the balcony were children who couldn't afford
tickets, he said.
	   A criminal investigation has been opened into the incident.
Friday was declared a day of mourning in the region.
	   Alexander Khashkhovov, assistant to Kabardino-Balkaraya
president Valery Kokov, said the collapse occurred because the
facility was old _ even though it was completed only four years
ago.
	   Sherbakov said it was in poor condition.
	   ``It could have collapsed because of poor construction, but
there were also too many people on the balcony,'' he said.
	   Shoddy construction and poor maintenance are endemic in Russia,
where funds for construction and repair of public buildings have
all but disappeared since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Kariya looks forward to next season

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ Paul Kariya, who battled
post-concussion syndrome for three months, credits twice-weekly
acupuncture treatments for his recovery from headaches and
dizziness.
	   ``Before, I couldn't remember the last time I felt good,'' the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks captain said. ``Now, I can't remember the last
time I felt bad.''
	   Kariya was cross-checked in the jaw Feb. 1 by Chicago's Gary
Suter, causing him to miss the Nagano Olympics and the National
Hockey League season's final 28 games.
	   ``I didn't think poking needles into me would work,'' said
Kariya, who began the acupuncture treatments April 20. ``I did it
for about a month and it was great. In North America, I don't think
acupuncture is looked upon that favorably, but it worked great for
me. Now it's good to be looking forward to next season.''
	   Kariya indicated Tuesday that he harbors no ill-will toward
Suter or former Chicago coach Craig Hartsburg, who is expected to
be interviewed soon for the Ducks' vacant coaching job.
	   Suter is an unrestricted free agent July 1 and there has been
talk that the Ducks would like to sign him.
	   ``If Gary Suter came to our team, I wouldn't have a problem with
him personally,'' Kariya said. ``You leave all that stuff out on
the ice.''
	   Kariya said he would wear a mouth guard for the first time in
his career next season, but doesn't plan to wear additional
protective head gear.
	   ``I've got to protect myself a little better,'' he said. ``Maybe
I've got to get my stick up a little bit and rack up some more
penalty minutes.''
	   That would be a change for the player who won the Lady Byng
trophy for gentlemanly conduct in 1995-96 and 1996-97.

Olowokandi determined to bring Clippers out of the cellar

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ There was no mention of million dollar
contracts. Not a hint of rookie of the year or MVP honors. Just
good old fashioned hard work.
	   That was the prevailing theme as the Los Angeles Clippers
unwrapped one of their latest purchases Thursday.
	   Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 overall pick in Wednesday's
National Basketball Association draft, greeted the local media
vowing ``to do whatever it takes to make the team better.''
	   The 6-foot-11 (2-meter) center from England repeatedly mentioned
hard work and giving his best effort when questions were fired at
him.
	   His parents, Ezekiel and Agnes, were busy snapping photos of
their son as he held up a white No. 1 Clippers jersey, traditional
for the first pick of the draft. His parent's camera kept clicking
as he held up another jersey, this time No. 34, the number he chose
to wear.
	   Thursday was the first time Olowokandi's parents had ever seen
him play basketball. They saw video highlights when he played for
the University of Pacific.
	   ``We are very excited. We are very, very proud,'' Ezekiel
Olowokandi said.
	   His parents, who live in Nigeria, did not want their son to play
basketball when he was studying in England, preferring that he
focus on academics and become an engineer.
	   The Clippers are glad he persuaded his parents to let him come
to the United States to play college basketball.
	   In a city full of marquee names, the Clippers hope Olowokandi,
nicknamed the ``Kandi Man,'' can upstage another center and former
No. 1 overall pick, the Los Angeles Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal.
	   ``It's big time coming to L.A.,'' Olowokandi, 23, said. ``To
play against Shaq and the Lakers, it's like a dream come true.''
	   For second-year Clippers forward Maurice Taylor, Olowokandi
seems like a dream, too.
	   ``I'm really excited. We now have a true center who can run the
floor and play defense,'' Taylor said. ``When he kept saying he was
going to work hard, that really showed me his true leadership.''

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The bodies of 40 guerrillas and the
remains of an Israeli soldier killed in fighting in south Lebanon
returned home Thursday night, completing the first stage of a swap
between Israel and Lebanon.
	   Lebanon received the bodies of the mostly Hezbollah fighters,
including the son of the guerrilla movement's leader Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah, with full military honors at 11.10 pm (2010 GMT).
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri led the ceremony at Beirut airport,
a move that showed the government recognized the Shiite Muslim
militants as national heroes.
	   ``We welcome today, with all respect, the bodies of a group of
our martyred children who return to the land where they grew up,
whose freedom they fought for and died for,'' Hariri said.
	   Lebanese soldiers carried the 40 coffins, wrapped in the
Lebanese flag, out of the French military transport plane that had
flown them from Tel Aviv, Israel.
	   The bodies will be buried in a funeral Saturday. Twenty-eight of
the dead had been members of Hezbollah, nine belonged to the Amal
movement, and three to the Lebanese Communist Party.
	   Less than five hours earlier, Lebanon had loaded on to the same
aircraft the remains of Israeli Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya, a naval
commando who was killed in a botched raid in the south in
September. Later, Israel received him with full honors at a
military airport outside Tel Aviv.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross mediated the
exchange. ICRC delegate Jean-Jacques Fresard, who struck the deal
in 10 months of tortuous negotiations, oversaw the exchange,
traveling both ways on the 50-minute flight between Beirut and Tel
Aviv.
	   ``We brought back Itamar's remains to Israel and now we will
bring back 40 dead bodies to Lebanon so people will now have a
proper burial,'' Fresard said in Tel Aviv. ``This is going to make
a number of families extremely happy so, as a humanitarian
organization, we can only be satisfied by this,'' he said.
	   The second stage of the swap is scheduled to take place Friday
when Israel frees 60 Lebanese prisoners at a crossing point in
Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. Some of the prisoners have been
held as long as 13 years.
	   An Israeli government statement said that none of the prisoners
to be released had ``blood on their hands.''
	   There was relief that the exchange took place, particularly as
hours earlier guerrillas had ambushed an Israeli patrol in south
Lebanon, killing two soldiers and wounding four others.
	   On the Israeli side of the swap, Ilya's remains arrived in
iceboxes in Tel Aviv where they were identified by an army chaplain
and placed into a coffin draped in the national flag.
	   Six naval commandos in white caps carried the coffin to a
military ambulance. Ilya will be buried Friday.
	   ``It's a mitzvah (Good deed) to return him to his family, to his
country,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Israel before
Ilya's body arrived.
	   But the swap yielded nothing to Israel about the prisoner it has
sought the longest, Ron Arad.
	   Hariri told reporters at the airport that if he knew where Arad
was, he would have negotiated to exchange him. Hezbollah's
Nasrallah made a similar remark recently.
	   A navigator, Arad was captured by guerrillas in 1986 after his
plane was shot down during a bombing mission over south Lebanon.
	   Outside Beirut airport, veiled women waved Hezbollah flags and
bearded Shiite men beat their chests in a traditional gesture of
mourning. Many had waited for the coffins since the afternoon.
	   Zeinab Shehadeh hoped to know the fate of her guerrilla brother,
who was 24 when he disappeared in 1989 after he set off for an
attack on Israeli forces.
	   ``I'm waiting to see if he comes today,'' the 60-year-old woman
said. ``Otherwise, I will try tomorrow to look for him among the
released,'' she added.
	   She will be disappointed. Kamel Shehadeh's name was on neither
the list of those in coffins nor on the list of those to be
released Friday.

	   LOS CHORROS, Mexico (AP) _ A dramatic homecoming for 850
refugees was canceled Thursday because of lingering fears over the
ongoing political strife in southern Chiapas state.
	   Members of the Las Abejas community had hoped to return home,
but said they still feared the pro-government vigilante groups that
murdered 45 people at one of their meetings in December.
	   Thousands of members of Las Abejas, a church-inspired community
group, last year fled homes in Chenalho municipality, which
includes Los Chorros, due to threats from pro-government groups who
considered them sympathetic to the Zapatista National Liberation
Army, which rebelled in 1994.

Nine bodies found in North Korean sub

	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean commandos cut open the
hatch of a captured North Korean submarine Friday and found nine
bodies, all shot to death in an apparent suicide pact.
	   Each of the nine North Koreans had been shot in the head and two
automatic rifles were found near their bodies in the main
compartment of the small sub, Lt. Col. Kim Jong-sook said.
	   The navy had delayed opening the hatch to the compartment
overnight for fear it was booby-trapped. To make sure the hatch was
safe, workers drilled holes in the deck and inserted tiny,
remote-controlled cameras to survey it.
	   Then they cut through the hatch with welding torches and found
the bodies.
	   The navy commandos climbed down the tower of the sub Thursday
and reached an upper access deck, but temporarily halted their
search when they encountered a second, sealed hatch leading to the
main compartment.
	   Lt. Col. Kim, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
two South Korean-made plastic beverage containers were found on the
access deck _ an indication the vessel was returning north after
dropping or picking up spies.
	   The sub sank Tuesday while being towed to Donghae naval base on
the east coast. Swift currents and high seas hampered the salvage
operation for two days.
	   Kim said the commandos temporarily stopped their search of the
sub's main deck on the advice of a former North Korean navy
commando, who warned it could be booby trapped.
	   The search Thursday began shortly after the submarine was
raised. Navy divers, racing an approaching storm, attached four
car-size yellow air bags to lift the submarine 110 feet to the
surface where an awaiting tug boat then towed it to shore.
	   The small, 70-ton Yugo-class submarine normally carries a crew
of about six, and is the sort used primarily to transport spies and
conduct coastline surveillance.
	   The sub was found in the general area where a larger North
Korean sub ran aground in 1996. That incursion triggered a 53-day
manhunt that left 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South Koreans
dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst in years.
	   In Seoul, President Kim Dae-jung reaffirmed that the latest
incident won't affect his policy of engagement toward the communist
North.
	   Opposition politicians and some newspaper editorials have
criticized Kim for not taking a harder line with North Korea
because of the sub episode.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Kurt Abbott doubled off the wall in left-center,
scoring Vinny Castilla with the winning run in the 12th inning as
the Colorado Rockies beat Houston 6-5 on Thursday to sweep a
two-game series.
	   Abbott, a defensive replacement in the ninth who was 0-for-14
since his trade from Oakland on June 9, broke through with his
clutch hit off Mike Magnante (3-2). Curtis Leskanic (4-3) pitched
two innings for the victory.
	   Houston tied it at 5 in the ninth on Derek Bell's two-run homer.
Craig Biggio also homered for Houston, and John Vander Wal
connected for Colorado.
 &UR; Athletics 5, Giants 2
	   In San Francisco, Rickey Henderson hit a two-run single with the
bases loaded in the fourth inning and the Oakland Athletics took
advantage of Shawn Estes' wildness to beat the Giants.
	   It was the A's second straight win at 3Com Park against their
cross-bay NL rivals. The A's won 7-6 on Wednesday night after the
Giants took the first two games of the series at Oakland Coliseum.
	   Jimmy Haynes (6-3) won his second straight start, allowing one
run on five hits in six innings. Bill Taylor got the final four
outs for his 15th save. Estes dropped to 6-6.
 &UR; Brewers 9, Twins 2
	   In Minneapolis, Cal Eldred allowed two runs in 7 1-3 innings,
and got all the support he needed in a three-run first as Milwaukee
beat Minnesota.
	   Eldred (3-5) gave up five hits and struck out six, winning his
first game since June 5. The Brewers scored three in the first with
the aid of three errors that sabotaged Minnesota starter Brad Radke
(8-6).
	   Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz hit a two-run homer in the ninth, his
18th of the season.

ADDS quote from U.S. press watchdog's letter to emir grafs 11-12 Kuwait journalists call for canceling prison sentence on editor 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwaiti journalists have called on the government
to annul a 6-month prison sentence imposed on an editor convicted
of insulting Islam.
	   The Kuwait Journalists Association also urged the government to
amend the law on publications to make it compatible with the
country's ``democratic atmosphere,'' the professional union said in
a statement issued Wednesday night.
	   A court sentenced the editor of the opposition newspaper,
Al-Qabas, and a freelance Egyptian journalist to six months in jail
on Wednesday for publishing a cartoon deemed to have insulted
Islam.
	   The cartoon, published Jan. 5 on the entertainment page, showed
a teacher asking his students, ``why did God kick out Adam and Eve
from heaven?'' A student answers: ``Because they hadn't paid the
rent.''
	   The editor, Mohammed Jassim al-Saqar, defended the cartoon,
saying ``it was only a joke.''
	   It was the first time an editor was sentenced to jail in Kuwait,
which has one of the freest media in the region. The freelancer,
Ibrahim Marzouk, who filed the cartoon from Egypt, was sentenced in
absentia.
	   Al-Saqar and Marzouk were prosecuted after Islamist legislators
complained to the Information Ministry.
	   In its statement, the journalists association called on the
government to ``cancel'' the prison sentence and added: ``It is
necessary to carry out fundamental amendments to the publication
law so that it suits the democratic atmosphere and general freedom
that Kuwait enjoys.''
	   A group of liberal intellectuals and legislators, the Kuwaiti
Democratic Platform, criticized the sentence Thursday as harsh.
	   ``We express our fear that this verdict will set a precedent in
imprisoning journalists and writers as if they were criminals or
corrupt persons who deserve harsh punishment.''
	   In New York, the watchdog Committee To Protect Journalists
issued an open letter to Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister,
Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, urging him to allow Al-Qabas to
publish and to explore legal options to rescind the convictions of
the two journalists.
	   ``We view the criminal prosecution and conviction of Mohammed
al-Saqar and Ibrahim Marzouk and the suspension of Al-Qabas as a
flagrant violation of the internationally recognized right of
journalists to report news and opinion freely,'' the letter said.

Kraft leads Western Open _ a tournament he wasn't supposed to play in AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   LEMONT, Illinois (AP) _ Greg Kraft had eight birdies and shot a
5-under-par 67 Thursday to take the lead after the first round of
the Western Open. Not bad for a guy who three days ago didn't know
he was going to be playing.
	   ``I didn't really practice this weekend, figuring I had this
weekend off,'' said Kraft, who was given a sponsor's exemption
Monday when Darren Clarke withdrew. ``Maybe that's what I needed,
to take a full week off instead of just part of a week.''
	   Vijay Singh was tied with Kraft going to the 18th tee, but his
drive on the par-4 hole went into deep rough and he put his second
shot into a sponsor's tent. He two-putted for bogey and a 68.
	   U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen picked up three strokes over the
last five holes to join Singh and Joe Durant and 4-under.
	   Jim McGovern and Steve Flesch were two shots behind Kraft in the
dlrs 2 million, Motorola-sponsored tournament. With heat, humidity
and a gusting wind, most of the rest of the field struggled just to
stay around par at Cog Hill's Dubsdread course.
	   Tiger Woods' troubles continued, as he finished nine strokes off
the leader at 4-over-par 76. Unless he makes a major move Friday,
the defending champion is in danger of missing just his second cut
since turning pro in August 1996.
	   ``Right now, I'm not looking too good,'' Woods said. ``But
there's three rounds left. Hopefully I can rally, put something
good together on the weekend.''
	   Kraft's best career finishes were seconds in the 1993 Disney
Classic and the 1994 Western Open, when he bogeyed the 18th hole to
finish one behind Nick Price. With the ball seeming to go his way
all day, Kraft said he couldn't help but think back to 1994.
	   He missed the cut in 1996 and 1997.
	   ``Some of the shots I hit back in '94 and some of the breaks
that I got today that I didn't get then, you know?'' he said. ``I
gave him (Price) the opportunity to win it. I didn't close the
deal. But it happens.''
	   Kraft didn't seem to make any bad decisions Thursday. He was at
even par after the seventh hole, and then moved atop the
leaderboard with four straight birdies on Nos. 8-11. He birdied 15,
16 and 17 to go 6-under, but finished his round with a bogey.
	   ``I got very lucky,'' he said. ``It seemed like whenever I was
up first, it really wasn't an opportunity to get a feel for someone
else's ball. We seemed to guess right.''
	   Woods, on the other hand, couldn't get anything right. His swing
hasn't felt comfortable all year, and he hoped coming to Cog Hill
might snap him out of a slump. Instead, he had his ugliest round in
weeks.
	   Starting off the back nine, he made the turn at 2-over and then
double bogeyed the par-3 second hole and bogeyed No. 4. He birdied
only two holes and didn't get his first one until No. 5, his 14th
hole.
	   ``I just didn't have a feel for my swing today,'' he said. ``I
couldn't get a flow for the greens, my flow for my stroke. My feel
was just not where it needed to be.''
	   Woods has won just one event, the BellSouth Classic, and wasn't
in contention in the U.S. Open last weekend. His string of major
championship rounds in the 70s is now at 14.

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ The fear of new World Cup violence was
tangible on the streets of this small northern French town
Thursday, with bars closing, and schoolchildren staying home.
	   Lens, a town of about 30,000 people, was hit by World Cup
violence last Sunday when German fans rampaged. A French policeman
hit over the head by an iron bar was left in a coma.
	   On Friday, the town plays host to a match between England and
Colombia.
	   Fear of English soccer hooligans is running high. In addition,
many people dread a return of the Germans, who, according to
reports, might seek a confrontation Friday with the English.
	   At the Carnot primary school, teacher Evelyne Tumerelle said
only three of her pupils would come to school on Friday, instead of
the usual number of 20.
	   ``You can understand their parents' fears,'' Tumerelle said.
Lens authorities said each school would decide whether to advise
parents to keep their children at home.
	   At a cafe on the central Boulevard Basly, owner Edith Fourneau
said many of her clients would not venture out until the fans were
out of town. She too plans to close for the weekend.
	   ``Having the Spanish in town Wednesday night was very good, but
the fear of British hooligans just won't go away,'' she said.
	   Late Thursday, police detained 18 English fans in the nearby
city of Lille after clashes with local youths. Four people were
slightly injured, police said. In Lens, tension was also running
high.
	   A bolstered police force was monitoring English fans, but Lens
police said there was no sign of German fans arriving.

Jailed ex-hockey czar is granted parole 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Alan Eagleson, once one of the most powerful men
in pro hockey, was granted parole Thursday after serving one-third
of an 18-month jail term for fraud.
	   Eagleson, 65, will be released from a Toronto-area prison on
July 7, corrections officials said after a closed-door parole board
hearing.
	   Ross Virgo, a spokesman for Ontario's Corrections Ministry, said
the board took into consideration Eagleson's conduct in prison and
the level of risk he posed to the community.
	   Parole is commonly granted in Canada to non-violent offenders
who serve one-third of their sentences without serious misconduct.
	   Eagleson, a former head of the National Hockey League Players
Association, pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud and theft on
Jan. 6 in Boston and was fined dlrs 1 million in Canadian funds.
The next day he pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud in Toronto,
agreeing in a plea bargain to an 18-month jail sentence.
	   Eagleson pleaded guilty to stealing Canada Cup tournament
rinkboard advertising money between 1984 and 1991, fraud involving
player pensions, player career-ending disability insurance money
and overcharging players as their former union boss.
	   Within weeks of his incarceration, he was disbarred by the Law
Society of Upper Canada and stripped of his membership in Canada's
Sports Hall of Fame. He later surrendered his status as a member of
the Hockey Hall of Fame.
	   Under the terms of his parole, Eagleson will have to remain in
Ontario, report regularly to a parole officer, avoid people with a
criminal past, and not switch jobs or move without permission.

Iranians saddened by loss to Germany and exit from the World Cup

ADDS teenager quote graf 3, no pickup

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian soccer fans took the defeat of their
World Cup team with good grace Thursday night, disappointed that
Germany had won 2-0 but not devastated.
	   ``The team didn't play bad and such a result for a team with
little experience against one of the best teams in the world is not
too bad,'' said Mousa Alavi, a young man walking home after the
match ended at 1:30 a.m. local time (2100 GMT).
	   ``We're disappointed,'' said Farzad, a teenager strolling
friends who declined to give his surname. ``We expected them to
beat Germany and let us dance in the street.''
	   Germany's victory in the southern French town of Montpellier
meant that Iran had been knocked out of the World Cup in the first
round.
	   The defeat came only four days after Iran's triumphant 2-1 win
over the United States, a game charged with political significance
born of the hostility between Washington and Tehran since the
Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   While the game against the United States triggered an all-night
party in the streets here, Thursday's match led to clusters of
people walking home from friends' houses in a resigned mood.
	   ``We will warmly welcome the team (home) because, compared with
other Asian teams, they played much better,'' said Mehvi Sedaqat.
`` They lost two matches, but that's football.''
	   Shahla Emami, a young woman walking home with her family, said
she too would go to Tehran airport to greet the team: ``This result
is not shameful.''
	   Before the match, Iranian ambitions ran sky-high with fans
hoping that their side would deliver a stunning upset by beating
the Germans, the current European champions and a team fancied to
win the Cup.
	   Squads of teenagers took to the streets of the capital before
the game began, shouting ``IRAN'' and blowing whistles. Passing
motorists joined in the clamor, honking their horns in support of
the demanded victory.
	   During the first half, Iran played so well that a win seemed
possible. The Tehran authorities sent thousands of traffic police
on to the streets in anticipation of wild celebrations.
	   But it was not to be. Early in the second half, German strikers
Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scored goals in quick
succession and Iran never managed a comeback.
	   Yet some Iranians still found cause for national pride. Several
cars drove home with passengers waving the green, white and red
flag. One vehicle had a man waving a flag on the one side and
another man blowing a plastic trumpet on the other side.

Ibrahim Marzouk, who filed the cartoon from Egypt, was sentenced in
absentia.
	   Al-Saqar and Marzouk were prosecuted after Islamist legislators
complained to the Information Ministry.
	   In its statement, the journalists association called on the
government to ``cancel'' the prison sentence and added: ``It is
necessary to carry out fundamental amendments to the publication
law so that it suits the democratic atmosphere and general freedom
that Kuwait enjoys.''
	   A group of liberal intellectuals and legislators, the Kuwaiti
Democratic Platform,also criticized the sentence.
	   ``We express our fear that this verdict will set a precedent in
imprisoning journalists and writers as if they were criminals or
corrupt persons who deserve harsh punishment,'' it said.
	   In New York, the watchdog Committee To Protect Journalists
issued an open letter to Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister,
Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, urging him to allow Al-Qabas to
publish and to explore legal options to rescind the convictions of
the two journalists.
	   ``We view the criminal prosecution and conviction of Mohammed
al-Saqar and Ibrahim Marzouk and the suspension of Al-Qabas as a
flagrant violation of the internationally recognized right of
journalists to report news and opinion freely,'' the letter said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton gently lectured
China on human rights Thursday and rejected criticisms of his
attempt to strengthen relations. ``We have a powerful ability to
help each other grow,'' he declared. Clinton's high-stakes journey
through China began amid reports of detention or harassment of
several dissidents, a matter U.S. Ambassador James Sasser planned
to raise with government officials on Friday. Clinton also was
expected to urge President Jiang Zemin to allow freer political
dialogue without government interference, said national security
spokesman P.J. Crowley. (CLINTON-CHINA)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
struggled Thursday to negotiate a cease-fire for warring Kosovo,
pressing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to pull back his
forces in the separatist province. Aiming to head off NATO
intervention in Kosovo, Holbrooke spent hours with Milosevic in the
presidential palace for the second time in three days. The West's
key point now, Holbrooke said, is ``that security forces, the armed
forces on both sides, should dismantle the checkpoints and withdraw
to ... barracks.'' Fighting between Serb-led Yugoslav forces and
the separatists' Kosovo Liberation Army has killed more than 300
people this year. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Knowing that their choices
could make or break the peace agreement, Northern Ireland's voters
on Thursday selected the politicians who will govern their divided
land in a new Assembly. Results for the 108-seat Assembly, the
central plank of the April 10 accord that most voters endorsed in a
referendum last month, won't be confirmed until late Friday or even
Saturday. But partly tabulated results from an exit poll were
disappointing for the Ulster Unionists, the north's major
pro-British Protestant party, whose backing for the agreement is
critical. The poll indicated that the Ulster Unionists received 20
percent of first-preference votes, compared with 19 percent for the
main opponent of the agreement, Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists.
(NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israel exchanged the bodies of 40
Lebanese guerrillas for the corpse of a single Israeli soldier on
Thursday, the first stage of the largest prisoner swap between the
two countries in two years. Lebanon received the bodies of the
mostly Hezbollah fighters, including the son of the guerrilla
movement's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, with full military
honors Thursday night. The second stage of the swap was to take
place Friday when Israel frees 60 Lebanese prisoners at a crossing
point in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. (ISRAEL-LEBANON)
	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean commandos cut open the
hatch of a captured North Korean submarine Friday and found nine
bodies, all shot to death in an apparent suicide pact. Each of the
nine North Koreans had been shot in the head and two automatic
rifles were found near their bodies in the main compartment of the
small sub, Lt. Col. Kim Jong-sook said. The navy had delayed
opening the hatch to the compartment overnight for fear it was
booby-trapped. To make sure the hatch was safe, workers drilled
holes in the deck and inserted tiny, remote-controlled cameras to
survey it. The sub got caught in a fishing net on Monday. It then
sank Tuesday while being towed to a South Korean naval base. Swift
currents and high seas hampered the salvage operation for two days.
(SKOREA-SUBMARINE)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Popular Algerian singer Lounes Matoub,
who survived an earlier kidnapping by Muslim militants and only
recently returned from exile, was killed near his Berber hometown
Thursday. It was the latest assassination of an Algerian artist
during a 6-year-old Muslim insurgency that has left more than
75,000 people dead. Matoub, 42, who like other Berbers fiercely
criticized both the military-backed government and Muslim
militants, was killed outside the village of Oued Aissi, near the
Berber regional capital of Tizi-Ouzou in eastern Algeria.

Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials clung to a slim gain, but
most stocks fell Thursday as investors locked in some profits from
the record-setting rebound of recent days. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose just 11.71 points to 8,935.58. The blue-chip index,
which had jumped 212 points the prior two sessions, peaked near
midday with a 101-point gain, pulling back almost as soon as it
pushed back above 9,000. Broad-market indicators turned lower as
several key technology names stumbled after a three-day rally that
helped push the Standard -and- Poor's 500 to its first record high
in two months. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Customers lined up again as the latest
version of Windows went on sale Thursday, but unlike the frenzy
surrounding Windows 95, many shoppers this time were hoping to get
dlrs 98 computers that happened to come with Windows 98. Some
retail stores opened at midnight to make the most of the first
sales of the latest version of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows. But it
took offers of huge discounts on new computers and other gadgets to
create lines reminiscent of the streams of computer enthusiasts who
scrambled to get their first copies of Windows 95. (US-WINDOWS
98-LAUNCH)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's opposition-dominated parliament decided
Thursday to delay consideration of a package of emergency economic
measures until next week despite Kremlin pressure for speedy
approval. The measures are needed to implement a new
budget-cutting, revenue-raising plan designed to win new loans from
the International Monetary Fund. Russia's financial markets have
been falling for months, with investors put off by the Asian
crisis, plummeting oil prices and the possibility of social unrest.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ General Motors Corp. may be headed toward a
legal showdown with the United Auto Workers to end costly strikes
that have crippled the world's No. 1 automaker. The warning came
Wednesday from GM labor chief Gerald Knechtel. ``Our contention is
that the strikeable issues identified by the union are contrived
and that the real issues that led to these costly disputes are ones
that the union has agreed to be non-strikeable,'' he said. The
strikes by 9,200 workers in Flint, Michigan, have caused the
layoffs of nearly 146,500 other GM workers from 26 major assembly
lines and about 100 parts plants across North America. The
shutdowns have virtually halted GM's North American production. The
blow to GM's second-quarter profit is expected to total more than
dlrs 1 billion. (US-GM STRIKES)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Worried that deepening economic pain
could fuel fresh riots, Indonesia and the International Monetary
Fund on Thursday announced a revised bailout deal loaded with fuel
and food subsidies for millions of poor people. The agreement opens
the way for the resumption of a dlrs 43 billion IMF-led rescue
package, badly needed to heal an economy expected to shrink by more
than 10 percent this year. Hubert Neiss, the IMF's senior official
in Asia, said even more international aid might be needed to
supplement the bailout. Directors of the 182-nation lending agency
are expected to approve the disbursement of new loans to Indonesia
at a meeting next month at their Washington headquarters.
(INDONESIA-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Economic policies endorsed by the
International Monetary Fund have devastated Malaysia's economy, the
prime minister said Thursday. ``Initially, we thought that IMF
strategies were very good. But they have damaged our economy,''
Mahathir Mohamad said. ``We're trying to figure out how to manage
our economy after the damage has been done,'' Malaysia, unlike its
economically battered neighbors, Indonesia and Thailand, has
resisted turning to the IMF for financial support. There already
are signs that Malaysia is ready to abandon the IMF-sanctioned
policies favored by Anwar. A new formula is being devised to
calculate interest rates and government spending is being increased
by 13 percent, or 7 billion ringgit (dlrs 1.8 billion).

Venus vs. Serena looms closer AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Venus Williams is gearing up for a
Wimbledon showdown against the ``juggernaut'' _ otherwise known as
her best friend and kid sister, Serena.
	   The Williams sisters crushed their second-round opponents in
straight sets Thursday _ each conceding only three games _ and are
on course for a high-powered meeting in the fourth round.
	   Venus routed Barbara Schett 6-1, 6-2, a victory that featured
the fastest serve ever recorded in women's tennis. Serena trounced
fellow 16-year-old Mirjana Lucic 6-3, 6-0.
	   Venus watched the first set of her sister's match on Centre
Court, then walked over to Court 1 to play her own.
	   ``Serena is definitely a juggernaut,'' Venus said.
	   And how do you stop a juggernaut?
	   ``Just become a bigger one yourself,'' she said. ``I guess you
have to become the nemesis.''
	   Venus, who turned 18 last week and is the No. 6 seed, is playing
in her second Wimbledon, while the unseeded Serena is appearing in
her first.
	   When the draw was made, it appeared unlikely the sisters would
meet because Serena had Anna Kournikova looming as a second-round
opponent. But Kournikova pulled out with a thumb injury, clearing
the path for an all-Williams clash.
	   There are just two remaining hurdles. Serena next plays Virginia
Ruano-Pascual, while Venus faces Chanda Rubin or Tara Snyder.
	   The sisters have met twice before in tournament play, at this
year's Australian Open and Italian Open. Venus won both times.
	   But it's Serena who seems to be adapting best to the grass.
	   ``When I first was hitting on it, the first week or so, I didn't
like it and had to keep telling myself that it's not that bad,''
she said. ``Now I really love it. I love it a lot.''
	   Venus is less enamored with the surface. Despite her height and
power, she has been hesitant to come to net.
	   ``You can't expect a person to throw away their old coat,
especially when it's their favorite,'' she said.
	   But the 6-foot-1 1/2 Venus has another weapon _ the biggest
serve in women's tennis.
	   In the third game of the second set against Schett, she unleased
a serve timed at 125-mph (201 kph), breaking the previous record of
123 mph (198 kph) set by Brenda Schultz-McCarthy at Wimbledon last
year.
	   Venus only learned of the achievement after her match from
Serena, who was told about it by reporters.
	   ``I wasn't going for any big ones today,'' she said. ``I barely
hit any. I think maybe at the most eight. So that was a real
surprise.''
	   The Williams sisters are off Friday, while Steffi Graf, Monica
Seles and Lindsay Davenport are among the women scheduled to play
third-round matches.
	   On the men's side, defending champion Pete Sampras faced a
potentially trick third-round match Friday against Sweden's Thomas
Enqvist.
	   The men's field has been decimated, with half of the 16 seeds
eliminated in the first two rounds.
	   The latest to go were Andre Agassi, the 1992 champion and No. 13
seed, and French Open champion Carlos Moya, No. 5.
	   Previous casualties were No. 2 Marcelo Rios, No. 4 Greg
Rusedski, No. 7 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 8 Cedric Pioline, No. 10
Alex Corretja and No. 15 Karol Kucera.
	   Agassi lost to 20-year-old German Tommy Haas 4-6, 6-1, 7-6
(7-4), 6-4. It was Agassi's second straight early Grand Slam exit,
following his first-round loss at the French Open.
	   Agassi, who dropped out of the top 100 last year, had surged
back up the rankings this year. His latest slump suggests he may
never get back to being the player he once was, but Agassi insisted
he still has the desire.
	   ``It even took Michael Jordan a year before he got to where he
was playing his best again,'' he said. ``So I have to at least give
myself a year just to see my best, whatever that may be. ...
	   ``Ultimately, you've got to be motivated for it, and I am. I'm
certainly not out there for my health.''

Portuguese abortion referendum seeks to settle divisive issue 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos LIS101-104
By BARRY HATTON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Olga Silva will never forget the botched
abortion 33 years ago, when a drunken woman without medical
training left her barren for life.
	   Jobless and unable to provide for a child, the 26-year-old Silva
had sought out the woman in a village near her home town of
Ermesinde, 180 miles (290 kilometers) north of Lisbon, the capital.
	   She bled for days after the procedure and when she went back for
help, the woman was drunk again. Olga was never able to bear
children.
	   Silva's is just one of more than 200 gruesome stories of illegal
abortions, some of them carried out on kitchen tables, chronicled
in a book published recently by the Movement for the Social
Emancipation of Women in Lisbon.
	   Predominantly Roman Catholic Portugal will take a new look at
its attitude toward abortion in a national referendum Sunday.
	   Under existing law, women can be imprisoned for up to three
years for having an illegal abortion. Termination of pregnancy is
permitted only through the 12th week and only for strictly defined
medical reasons or in cases if rape.
	   Prohibition does not equal prevention in Portugal, a nation of
9.5 million people. Pro-abortion activists estimate there are at
least 16,000 illegal abortions each year .
	   The issue has occupied political parties in Parliament since
leftist parties first had enough seats to force the issue onto the
legislative agenda 14 years ago.
	   In Portugal's first-ever national referendum, the people will
decide whether abortion on demand through the 10th week of
pregnancy should be ``decriminalized,'' which in effect will
eliminate current prohibitions.
	   Parliament passed the proposal in February, but opponents
successfully pushed for a referendum, and the ballot will either
overturn or ratify the legislation.
	   The two-week campaign leading up to election day, featuring
marches and media campaigns, has demonstrated how deeply the issue
has split society.
	   The younger generation, backed by leftist politicians, largely
wants a more liberal approach to unwanted pregnancies. The
opposition comes generally from older, conservative Portuguese,
supported by the influential Catholic church and conservative
parties.
	   Spearheading the pro-choice lobby is the civic movement Yes for
Tolerance, which gathered the 5,000 signatures entitling it to free
airtime on national television.
	   Manuela Tavares, a school teacher and one of the movement's
leaders, calls existing law ``downright hypocritical.''
	   She said there are no women in prison for having abortions,
which indicates society tacitly accepts it.
	   She wants to bring abortions out of sinister back rooms _ where
it costs about dlrs 543, almost twice the minimum monthly wage _
and into the national health care system.
	   Government statistics indicate that each year about 10,000 women
are treated at hospitals for complications stemming from bungled
illegal abortions, which are the second-most common cause of
maternal deaths and the main cause of adolescent maternal deaths.
	   But for abortion opponents, the only issue is the sanctity of
life.
	   ``If today we authorize the death of a fetus, then one day
there'll be a law allowing the termination of old age or of
handicapped people,'' says Dom Duarte Pio, the Duke of Braganza,
who has lent his name to the anti-abortion campaign.
	   Opinion polls over the past two months have indicated that the
yes vote will win, though its support has slipped from about 60
percent of the vote to just over 50 percent since campaigning
began.
	   ``It's a tough decision,'' said Filipa Ferreira, a 33-year-old
factory worker. ``I don't want babies to be killed, but I don't
want these terrible abortions to continue either.''

	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Can Andre Agassi really come back?
	   He says he can, despite a four-set loss _ spread over two days _
to 20-year-old German Tommy Haas in Wimbledon's second round.
	   ``It even took Michael Jordan a year before he got to where he
was playing his best again,'' said Agassi, the 1992 champion who
has risen to 19 in the ATP rankings after plunging to 122 at the
end of last season.
	   ``So I have to at least give myself a year _ just to see my
best, wherever that may be. Right now I feel I have a lot more to
do with some of these defeats than my opponents.''
	   If he hadn't been slightly unlucky against Haas, Agassi might
have reached the third round. But what he lacks more than luck is
being toughened by week-in, week-out play.
	   Motivation is not the issue.
	   ``The motivation takes on a life of its own, here especially,''
said the winner of three Grand Slams.
	   Agassi was getting match-hardened, his game near full stride
after a surprising early season on hard courts. Then he suffered a
shoulder injury a month ago in a disappointing first-round loss in
the French Open to Russian teen-ager Marat Safin.
	   The comeback gallop slowed to a walk again as the 28-year-old
Agassi spent a month getting well for Wimbledon's quirky grass.
	   ``The question is match play, match toughness, match
sharpness,'' he said. ``That's something I've been fighting to get
since the beginning of the year.''
	   Agassi trailed two sets to one when the second-round match was
suspended because of darkness Wednesday. Haas won the fourth set
Thursday to prevail 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4.
	   A crucial line call helped Haas win the third set when he hit a
forehand that replays showed was clearly out.
	   `Three people had to miss that call,'' Agassi said. ``It was
long, it was wide and nobody overruled it.''
	   But there were no alibis.
	   ``I didn't deserve to win the match,'' he added. ``I didn't do
what I needed to do. Three of the first sets were completely in my
hands.''
	   With his focus now on the U.S. Open, the hard-court season and
the Davis Cup, Agassi is looking for a new crest after a dip at
Wimbledon.
	   ``I've been through this many times before in my career where
I've kind of gone up and gone down,'' he said.
	   ``I know this feeling real well, I know this road real well,''
he went on. ``And ultimately you've got to be motivated for it and
I am. I'm certainly not here for my health.''

No mas for Moya AP Sports Writer

By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ French Open champion Carlos Moya was
handling the grass OK. What he couldn't beat was Wimbledon's rainy
weather.
	   The 21-year-old Spaniard, raised on the Mediterranean island of
Mallorca, won the first set against Morocco's Hicham Arazi 6-4. He
led in the second 3-2 with a break and was leading on serve 30-15.
Then rain hit Thursday's second-round match.
	   The break lasted 30 minutes, and it broke Moya as Arazi went on
to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.
	   ``That break killed me,'' said Moya, the No. 5 seed here and the
best of Spain's players on grass. ``Maybe I didn't warm up well. I
don't know what happened.''
	   Moya was flat on his back a week ago with an intestinal
infection and arrived at Wimbledon several days late with only two
grass-court match played this spring.
	   ``No excuses,'' he said. ``The rain, the weather I have to deal
with it. English weather is not going to change for anybody.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   TOP SPEED: &LR;  Venus Williams is now tennis' fastest-serving woman.
The American hit a serve Thursday at 125 mph (201 kph) during her
victory over Barbara Schett.
	   The serve broke the previous record of 123 mph (198 kph) set by
Brenda Schultz-McCarthy at Wimbledon last year. Williams' previous
best was 122 mph (196 kph) at the Lipton Championships this year.
	   Williams beat Schett 6-1, 6-2.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MUY MAL, MARCELO: &LR;  Marcelo Rios' brief, controversial appearance
at Wimbledon didn't sit well with six-time women's champion Billie
Jean King.
	   The sullen Rios, the Australian runner-up and seeded second at
Wimbledon his professed aversion to grass, was eliminated Wednesday
by Francisco Clavet, then ripped Wimbledon as ``just another
tournament.''
	   ``It's horrible when you see Rios in the last couple of games in
his match and he doesn't care,'' said King, a Hall of Famer and
commentator for HBO.
	   ``He was diabolical in his criticism of the tournament. He has
no appreciation of history or his heritage or the people who came
before him.''
	   Rios, who was briefly ranked No. 1 earlier this year, complained
about the officiating and transportation at Wimbledon and said
grass-court tennis is boring.
	   ``He needs to support the sport whether it's on grass, clay or
cement,'' King said. ``He needs to grow up.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HAAS NO BECKER: &LR;  Andre Agassi, beaten by German Tommy Haas in
the second round, isn't picking the 20-year-old German as the next
Boris Becker. He knows him well. They both learned the game at Nick
Bollettieri's academy in Florida.
	   So can Haas win a Grand Slam?
	   ``I like Tommy a lot, I really do,'' Agassi said. ``But I don't
think so. I really don't. He's a talented player, he does a lot of
things well _ but he has big swings, which means he needs time to
strike the ball. His serve doesn't really separate him.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VENUS MUSINGS: &LR;  Venus and Serena Williams have their little
spats. Venus says she doesn't mind sharing, but she draws the line
when Serena swipes her cookies.
	   ``I wish she would stop, like, taking my things,'' she said.
``Like I have a cookie... but I go to do something with my mom and
I come back and the cookie is gone.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   STEFFI STALKER: &LR;  Police at Wimbledon are reported keeping a
close watch on a 35-year-old Egyptian who tossed candy at Steffi
Graf on Monday after her first-round win.
	   Graf denied she knew the man, although the British tabloids
claimed he was a stalker.
	   The Daily Mail quoted the man as saying, ``Steffi's the love of
my life... I'm a single man and I've never married _ there's no
room for another woman in my life.''

	   DONGHAE, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean commandos cut open the
hatch of a captured North Korean submarine Friday and found nine
bodies, all shot to death in an apparent suicide pact.
	   Four of the North Koreans had been shot in the head, while the
other five had been shot in other parts of the body, said Lt. Col.
Kim Jong-sook. Two automatic rifles were found near bodies in the
main compartment of the small sub.
	   The navy had delayed opening the hatch to the compartment
overnight for fear it was booby-trapped. To make sure the hatch was
safe, workers drilled six holes in the submarine and inserted tiny,
remote-controlled cameras to survey it.
	   Then they cut through the hatch with welding torches and found
the bodies. Four bodies were found in the rear of the submarine,
the rest in other compartments, officials said.
	   The navy commandos climbed down the tower of the sub Thursday
and reached an upper access deck, but temporarily halted their
search when they encountered a second, sealed hatch leading to the
main compartment.
	   President Kim Dae-jung said the North Koreans ``appear to have
been on an infiltration mission,'' according to a presidential
spokesman.
	   Lt. Col. Kim, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
two South Korean-made plastic beverage containers were found on the
access deck _ an indication the vessel was returning north after
dropping or picking up spies.
	   He also said the equipment inside the submarine was all intact,
meaning the vessel would provide ``valuable information about North
Korean navy and the commando activities.''
	   The sub sank Tuesday while being towed to Donghae naval base on
the east coast. Swift currents and high seas hampered the salvage
operation for two days.
	   Kim said the commandos temporarily stopped their search of the
sub's main deck on the advice of a former North Korean navy
commando, who warned it could be trapped.
	   The search Thursday began shortly after the submarine was
raised. Navy divers, racing an approaching storm, attached four
car-size yellow air bags to lift the submarine 30 meters (110 feet)
to the surface where an awaiting tug boat then towed it to shore.
	   The small, 70-ton Yugo-class submarine normally carries a crew
of about six, and is the sort used primarily to transport spies and
conduct coastline surveillance.
	   The sub was found Monday in the general area where a larger
North Korean sub ran aground in 1996. That incursion triggered a
53-day manhunt that left 24 North Korean infiltrators and 13 South
Koreans dead and relations between the two Koreas at their worst in
years.
	   In Seoul, President Kim reaffirmed that the latest incident
won't affect his policy of engagement toward the communist North.
	   Opposition politicians and some newspaper editorials have
criticized Kim for not taking a harder line with North Korea
because of the sub episode.
	   The 1950-53 Korean War ended without a peace treaty and the two
nations are technically still at war. Their border on the divided
peninsula is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
troops on both sides.

Mexico suffering worst drought in 70 years With Mexico-The Dry Life

<TEXT>
	   RANCHO EL PITALLO, Mexico (AP) _ The cactuses and the cowboys
expect little rain on the hard ranges of northern Mexico. But with
a bad drought in its fifth year, even the cactuses are dry. The
cowboys are desperate.
	   ``The only solution is that it rains,'' rancher Mario Moreno
says. ``The cattlemen can ask that only of the skies, and from
above.''
	   Thin and thirsting, thousands of cattle have died in the
country's worst drought in 70 years. Ranchers are whittling down
their herds to survive _ many selling off calves to the United
States.
	   The drought hit central and southern Mexico more recently, a
rarity blamed on the El Nino shift in weather patterns, but its
impact is severe.
	   In hot central states, children are dying of dehydration. In the
south, wildfires recently tore through dried out rain forest and
corn crops have shriveled.
	   At May's end, Mexico this year had received an average 2.2
inches (55 mm) of rain, 54 percent below the norm. Reservoirs in
central Mexico are at 15 percent capacity, and at 20 percent in the
north.
	   In Sonora, a northern border state known for its roughened
desert cowboys, there have been only sparse showers since 1992.
	   ``It's a truly sad situation,'' says Jesus Ancheta Molina of the
state's regional cattlemen's union in Hermosillo, the state
capital. ``This is a state which shows that the people fight. Our
activity is very traditional, filled with pride.''
	   On Rancho El Pitallo, a hard scratch of land 50 miles (80 kms)
east of Hermosillo, Moreno and his brothers own 200 head of cattle.
They are among the small ranchers said to be worst hit by the
drought.
	   Grunting ``Hu! _ Ha!,'' Moreno drives his cows on a walk for
scant forage. Young calves eagerly lap up whey dripping from a bag
of fresh cheese hanging from the ranch hand's shack.
	   Altogether, 200 people share 45,700 acres (18,500 hectares) on
and surrounding Rancho El Pitallo. Such cooperatives, called
``ejidos,'' were allocated in the aftermath of the 1910-17
revolution and typically made from less productive land.
	   The drought has turned the earth into pale dirt. Without grass,
Moreno and the others must buy hay and vitamins, and sell cattle to
come up with the money.
	   ``This is not a business,'' Moreno says with a sigh.
	   The ejido has 1,500 head of cattle _ the remaining half of what
has been sold off in the last two years, Moreno says.
	   Across Sonora, the number of cattle has dropped by a third since
1994, Ancheta says while ranchers in jeans and boots auction off
cattle behind his Hermosillo office.
	   Sonora is the top state in exporting calves to the United
States, where they are fattened on feed lots, and second only to
neighboring Chihuahua state in overall cattle production.
	   Before the drought, Mexico exported an average 1 million calves
a year. That jumped to 1.4 million in 1995 when the drought and the
1994 peso devaluation left ranchers struggling, says Chuck Lambert,
chief economist for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in
Washington.
	   With herds depleted, the number sank to 420,000 in 1996 and was
still at a low 622,000 last year. Though herds have yet to recover,
exports are on track to reach 800,000 this year, Lambert says _ an
indication that future cattle supplies will be limited.
	   Even if it were to begin pouring tomorrow, it will take three or
four years to recover. The drought has hurt the quality of grass
produced, making it harder for cows to gain weight and support
pregnancies, says Eduardo Salcedo Martinez, state deputy secretary
for cattle development.
	   Mexico's National Cattlemen's Confederation says thousands of
cattle have died across Mexico, though it has no exact numbers.
	   Crops have died, too. The Agriculture Ministry expects Mexico
will need to import about 14.5 million tons (13.5 million metric
tons) of grain this year, a 17 percent increase from 1997.
	   In Chiapas, the primary coffee-producing state, more than half
of the 1998-99 crop is expected to be lost.
	   Dozens of children have been reported dead from dehydration as
heat waves pushed temperatures above 100 degrees (40 C) in some
states.
	   The government has said it will spend more than 300 million
pesos (dlrs 35 million) to help build water tanks and deliver
monetary and food aid.
	   With El Nino said to be dying out, rains may be coming. But
meteorologists say a new phenomenon, a cooling of Pacific waters
known as ``La Nina,'' is on the way.
	   Thin clouds graze the summer sky above Sonora, but they are only
a tease. Alejandro Manza Figueroa, Moreno's neighbor at the Rancho
El Pozo _ Spanish for ``The Well'' _ tampers any optimism.
	   A well pump the government installed in 1974 worked only a year
before the well went dry, Manza says. A 300-foot-deep
(100-meter-deep) well dug later with a pickax now holds just a bit
of dirty water.
	   For drinking and cooking, Manza fills a barrel with water driven
in from a nearby town. But each trip costs him 30 pesos (dlrs 3.50)
in gas.
	   ``We don't have the means to be spending so much,'' he says,
wearing a faded and torn shirt. ``We are poor people.''
	   Looking up, he judges the hazy sky.
	   ``Well, here come the little clouds. Hopefully it will rain.
They announce water, but don't say when.
	   ``How does it look to you?'' he asks with a sad laugh.

	   EL COYOTE, Mexico (AP) _ Deftly splicing thorns off a cactus
pad, Senora Maria Elena Viera shoos a baby goat from the bucket
holding her family's supper.
	   Viera, a plump woman with a contagious smile, makes life seem
easy in El Coyote _ no small task in the village that hasn't seen
rain in 16 months.
	   The reason for El Coyote's existence is not obvious. Some 70
miles (110 kilometers) north of San Luis Potosi, the state capital,
and six miles (nine kilometers) down a rocky, dirt path from the
highway, the village of 600 people seems to sit in the middle of
not much.
	   Thick patches of ancient cactuses. Boulder-strewn hills. Stream
beds turned to dust.
	   Indian women dangling snake skins try to flag down buyers in the
semi-trucks roaring by.
	   With Mexico enduring its worst drought in 70 years, even the
village patch of nopal cactuses must be irrigated.
	   The green, oval pads being spliced and diced by Senora Viera on
this scorching afternoon are a gift from the government. Dried-out
nopales cut from the desert are feed for cattle.
	   Water piped in from a nearby city is used for drinking and
cooking, but that is limited: Water for washing and animals comes
from a town reservoir.
	   At a brackish pool of green water buzzing with insects,
14-year-old Alejandro Guerra Garcia fills a barrel to carry home on
a mule-pulled cart. His family of 10 sometimes uses the fetid water
for cooking when they have nothing else, he says.
	   ``It sickens the people,'' village leaer Jose Luis Torres Montes
says.
	   Another reservoir has shrunk so low its water is good for
nothing, Viera's husband, Marcelino Rodriguez, says. Wandering cows
take a few sips before turning away.
	   The hip bones cut sharply from one cow in the shade of
Rodriguez's house. A hungry calf repeatedly slams its head into the
udder of its mother, trying to squeeze out a bit more milk.
	   It would seem the family is suffering, but Viera only laughs.
	   Over open coals, she cooks up a meal of thick, homemade
tortillas, nopales mixed with eggs from her hens, and nopales
sauteed with onions. A thick slab of homemade goat cheese sits at
the center of the table.
	   There are no property taxes to pay in El Coyote, she notes. No
trouble with crime. No worries for her children. No noise. There's
nowhere else she'd rather live.
	   Rodriguez points to his cows, the goats and dogs wandering the
yard, a pack of pigs lounging under his old pickup.
	   ``We are poor. But we have everything,'' he says.
	   Holding still for a moment in the rustle of the wind, a
city-dweller almost envies him.

The Patz case: one man's burden AP National Writer 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos NY324-NY326
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It remains the one case that Stuart GraBois
can't shake.
	   The former prosecutor still imagines 6-year-old Etan Patz,
baseball cap on his head, walking solo to his school bus for the
first time _ and never boarding it. He dwells on Etan's parents
whose son _ he would now be 25 _ was taken before his seventh
birthday.
	   ``I think I'll always carry that with me,'' GraBois reflected.
	   NYPD case No. 836, officially listed as a ``stranger
abduction,'' is better known as the incident that forever altered
American parenting, put the photos of lost children on U.S. milk
cartons, turned May 25, the date of Etan's vanishing, into National
Missing Children's Day.
	   ``I think of that little kid, and what he thought at the moment
he realized that he was in trouble,'' continued GraBois, now a
union benefits fund official, sitting in his Manhattan office. ``I
can't forget that.''
	   He hasn't. GraBois, who joined the case as an assistant U.S.
attorney in 1985, has emerged as the public point man on the
19-year-old case that instigated a worldwide search, with pictures
of the missing Etan posted in 60 countries.
	   It was GraBois who recently declared, without elaborating, that
evidence indicated Etan was dead.
	   And it is GraBois, a close friend of Etan's father, who has made
a mission of keeping a Pennsylvania pederast behind bars. Although
the man has never been charged in the Patz abduction, GraBois
accuses him of kidnapping and killing the blond-haired, blue-eyed
child.
	   Convicted sexual offender Jose Antonio Ramos, 55, is ``a demon,
devoid of any decency,'' GraBrois said two days after this year's
anniversary of Etan's disappearance. Ramos, convicted of sexually
molesting two boys, is serving a 13 1-2 -to-27-year jail term.
	   It was GraBois who put him there.
	   He pursued Ramos to rural Pennsylvania in 1990, intent on
solving the Patz mystery. In an extraordinary legal move, the
Manhattan prosecutor was declared a Pennsylvania deputy state
attorney general and reopened a four-year-old child sex case
against Ramos.
	   With his new powers, GraBois grilled Ramos about Etan's
disappearance. The prosecutor wanted a confession, wanted to end
the years of tortured waiting by Etan's parents, Stan and Julie
Patz.
	   But Ramos, the friend of a Patz family babysitter, offered only
teasing bits of information: Yes, he had picked up the boy on the
morning of May 25, 1979, and tried to sexually abuse him. No, he
had not killed him, he had put him on a northbound subway near the
boy's home.
	   It was another in an endless series of dead ends. Ramos, already
serving time for molesting a 7-year-old boy, pleaded guilty in
November 1990 to the Pennsylvania charge. GraBois eventually
accepted the Manhattan district attorney's decision: Without a
confession, there was no case against Ramos.
	   The prosecutor, however, never abandoned the case. He kept in
touch with investigators. He made sure that he stayed in the loop
even after leaving the U.S. attorney's office in 1993. He
maintained contact with Stan Patz, who had become a friend.
	   In GraBois' office, a courtroom artist's drawing of the former
prosecutor at Ramos' sentencing hangs on the wall. But GraBois
insists that he is not the Inspector Javert of the Patz case.
	   ``I'm not obsessed,'' GraBois insisted, his voice even. ``The
cases that stick with you are the very significant cases. And I
happen to be fond of Stanley as an individual.''
	   Ramos' response? The inmate ``wants nothing to do with
reporters,'' said Jim Forr, the public information officer for the
State Correctional Institution at Frackville, Pennsylvania.
	   GraBois won't say if the Patz family shares his belief that Etan
is dead, and the family no longer speaks with reporters. But Stan
and Julie Patz have long held out hope that their missing boy is
somewhere out there.
	   The misty morning when Etan fell off the face of the earth
irreversibly altered the United States' attitude toward missing
children. It put a human face on a statistic: 12,000 children
abducted each year.
	   The face was Etan's _ his unevenly chopped hair, his moon-shaped
eyes, his crooked smile. Parents became instantly aware of the
threat to their children, a threat that ends in death 300 times a
year. A national day was established, and a national center to find
missing children.
	   GraBois said Etan's legacy goes further. The Ramos prosecution,
prompted by the Patz case, ``saved other children from similar
fates,'' he said.
	   GraBois and Stan Patz intend to protect that legacy. Ramos comes
up for parole on Sept. 13, 2000. GraBois, as the prosecutor in the
case, intends to address the parole board.
	   Etan's father cannot speak, because Ramos was never convicted of
a crime against his son. But he will accompany his friend, the
former prosecutor, to Pennsylvania.
	   ``Stan and I,'' GraBois promised, ``both plan to be there.''

Isolation key to drug-rehabilitation program in Vietnam

<TEXT>
	   THAC BA LAKE ISLAND, Vietnam (AP) _ Hoang Van Tuyen sits
cross-legged on a thin straw mat, avoiding any movement that might
aggravate the withdrawal pains wracking his thin body.
	   A three-day fast from opium has yet to break his addiction. But
any thoughts of meeting with old friends for a quick smoke are lost
in the prospect of a 700-yard (650-meter) swim to shore.
	   Tuyen is a new arrival at the Opium Abstaining Center of Yen Bai
Province, a unique rehabilitation center on a river island that
credits its relative success to isolation, long stays and a family
atmosphere.
	   The program has drawn government attention because drug
addiction is on the rise in Vietnam, particularly among the young.
	   The newspaper Van Hoa (Culture) says the number of addicts
nationwide is estimated at 133,000 _ 70 percent of them under age
30.
	   This year's U.S. State Department report on narcotics estimates
annual opium production in Vietnam has nearly doubled, from 25
metric tons to 45.
	   As part of a crackdown, Vietnam's government is hitting at
traffickers by cutting the amounts of heroin and opium a person can
possess before facing the death penalty. And it's pursuing
high-profile cases, including one in which seven people were
executed.
	   Thac Ba is home to heroin and opium addicts alike. During a
reporter's visit, most of the 156 patients are relaxing in the
shade after an afternoon of manual labor that is part of their
rehabilitation program.
	   But three sit inside with Tuyen, offering encouragement in low
tones.
	   ``I feel pain all over my body right now,'' says Tuyen, his
pocked face sallow and his eyes dull. ``I still haven't kicked the
habit, but I feel a little better.
	   ``When I was still craving, I was very short-tempered. I was
very angry to be here. But maybe it's good for me to be here.''
	   Dr. La Quang Ung, the center's energetic director, is upbeat
even though surveys of the 1,405 patients treated since the program
started in 1992 show a readdiction rate of 60 percent. Some are
back for the second or third time.
	   ``It's not a desired figure, but it is a very difficult and
complicated problem,'' Ung says, noting the readdiction rate
nationwide ranges from 70 percent to 80 percent.
	   Some patients come voluntarily or are sent by their families.
Courts send others. Most are natives of Yen Bai or other provinces
in Vietnam's mountainous north, but some come from as far away as
Ho Chi Minh City, 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) to the south.
	   Only two current patients are women. All are between 18 and 40.
	   Some do drop out, either making the long swim _ ``It's not that
far; I can do it,'' Ung says _ or catching rides on passing boats.
But Ung says the number is decreasing, falling to just under 10
percent last year, with most coming back after center employees
talk with their families.
	   Patients live in communal residences built by their predecessors
at the center, a 42.5-hectare (105-acre) island 160 kilometers (100
miles) north of Hanoi. The air is clean, and when there's no soccer
on television, it's quiet.
	   The program is time-consuming. Patients stay for six months to a
year. That, along with the isolation that keeps drugs out and a
community-based staff that includes former patients, are the keys,
Ung says.
	   ``I can assume most of the guys coming here are bad guys with
bad habits,'' he says. ``We have ways to limit that and inspire
good habits. Our staff has to be close to the patients. They don't
live with them, but they always are nearby.''
	   It takes five to 15 days to break physical addiction, with the
average patient gaining four kilograms (nine pounds).
	   Over the next six months, patients follow a strict schedule of
exercise, manual labor and sports. Patients harvest timber for the
paper industry. They grow some of their own crops and raise pigs,
goats and cows.
	   Those who stay longer get basic vocational training courses that
are limited by scant funds to construction, carpentry and
tailoring. The center increasingly has to rely on such labor to get
by because the cash-strapped government's contribution has dropped
by a third.
	   After a patient leaves, the center maintains contact with local
authorities, to whom the former addicts have to report monthly.
	   ``If there are signs of readdiction, we get the officials to
send them back,'' Ung says.
	   Going home is what worries Tuyen.
	   ``I think I'd rather stay here to completely break the habit,''
he says. ``If I went back now, I think I'd be on the same track. I
worry that I will see my friends again and will be tempted.''

Bomb threats at hospitals, government offices, elderly home 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Police detonated a bomb planted at
their headquarters and reported 26 bomb threats at government
offices, hospitals and a state home for the elderly in a week of
violent, racially charged protests.
	   Police were still investigating the firebombing of the Labor
Ministry on Tuesday, another apparent firebombing in the Finance
Ministry and a small explosion in the Health Ministry on Monday.
	   Home Affairs Minister Sam Hinds said Thursday that developments
were ``exceedingly alarming.''
	   Bomb experts exploded the bomb found Thursday in the police
headquarters, two blocks from Parliament, police said. The other
threats were hoaxes but forced dozens of workers to evacuate, they
said.
	   Protesters who claim the People's Progressive Party of President
Janet Jagan rigged the Dec. 15 elections have led a week of violent
demonstrations in this South American country.
	   Most of the protesters are Guyanese of African descent who back
the opposition People's National Congress. Jagan's party is
supported mainly by people of East Indian descent.
	   No clashes with police were reported Thursday, but in recent
days demonstrators threw stones and firebombs at riot police, and
police countered with tear gas and warning shots in the air.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It's not surprising that the World Cup is not
doing as well on American television as it did in 1994: The
tournament is in Europe, the games are not in prime time and the
United States is out after one round.
	   In any case, soccer is a tough sell in the United States. The
biggest proof comes in the television numbers. More
Spanish-speaking Americans are watching games than are
English-speaking Americans.
	   Spanish-language Univision is averaging 767,000 households
through 32 live games, easily eclipsing averages of 592,000 and
346,000 on two English-language sports networks.
	   Disney-owned ABC and ESPN, which signed a six-year deal with
Major League Soccer last year and hope to broadcast the 2002 World
Cup, remain bullish on soccer.
	   ``We consider ourselves the network of soccer in general and the
network of the World Cup specifically,'' ABC Sports spokesman Mark
Mandel said. ``We're committed to this with or without the U.S.
team.''
	   ABC and ESPN are expected to make a profit on their dlrs 22
million investment and ESPN has as much as doubled its rating for
weekday time slots.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A mystery England fan will attempt to make peace
with the French public and restore some pride in the English flag
at England's World Cup match against Colombia Friday.
	   The man is expected to unfurl a 12ft by 6ft (3 by 4 meter)
England flag, which will read ``France we are sorry, pardon''.
	   The apology, for the involvement of English soccer hooligans in
violence at Marseilles after England's World Cup opener against
Tunisia, will be printed clearly on the Saint George Cross.
	   The banner was ordered from a north-east England flag-maker by
an anonymous England supporter from London.
	   Mandy Scott, who operates AA Flags based in Consett, Durham,
said the fan ordered the flag Tuesday and sent a messenger to pick
it up later that day.
	   ``The gentleman wouldn't even give his name _ I think he may
have been worried about hooligans finding out who he was. I've no
idea why he wanted to apologize.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's World Cup soccer thugs were backed
Thursday by the 79-year-old Marchioness of Reading, who proclaimed:
``Now that we don't have a war, what's wrong with a good
punch-up?''
	   The Marchioness said she wanted to back Conservative MP Alan
Clark's recent remarks defending the fans in France.
	   ``How did we colonize the world,'' she asked in a letter to The
Spectator magazine. ``Our fame as fighters is second to none.''
	   ``How is it that we conquered the world and that our armies went
over the top? How is it that the most inventive people in the world
come from England? It is because we are a nation of fighters.''
	   ``I get fed up with everyone saying how evil these yobbos are
... what an English tough guy does is to fight with his fists,
which is a good clean fight,'' she said. ``With so many ...
left-wing liberals and wetties around, I just rejoice in the fact
that there are people who keep up our historic spirit.''
	   The Marchioness, who is the widow of the Third Marquis of
Reading, will be 80 next January.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ England's Football Supporters Association has set
up a telephone hotline as part of a plan to make sure fans who paid
for tickets which never materialized are compensated for their
losses.
	   Association spokesman Paul Thomas said up to 23,000 fans had
bought World Cup tickets through various agencies but did not
receive what they had paid for.
	   Thomas said the fans involved should be compensated for the cost
of any packages they purchased and also for the loss of enjoyment
and distress caused to them.
	   Information from the hotline will help the FSA piece together
the complex web of ticket agency relationships which led to a
number of companies failing to supply tickets.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With 2,000 riot police standing nearby,
thousands of fans thronged Mexico City's streets with their faces
painted in the national colors to celebrate Mexico's qualification
Thursday for the second round of the World Cup.
	   Singing ``We proved we could,'' throngs of teen-agers in Mexico
City, Monterrey and Guadalajara rejoiced about Mexico's 2-2 tie
with Holland, which guarantees the team will advance in the
international soccer tournament.
	   ``The next team we play is going to eat Mexican chili! We're
spiced up!'' gloated Enrique Robles, celebrating at Mexico City's
Independence monument with his hair painted red, green and white -
the colors of the Mexican flag.
	   Riot police with shields and officers on horseback charged down
the Paseo de la Reforma, the capital's main boulevard, to disperse
crowds of raucous fans. Some revelers responded by throwing rocks,
bottles and soft drink cans at the police.
	   At least 11 people were reported injured. One newspaper
photographer with a gash to the head was loaded onto an ambulance.
Dozens of people were arrested.

World Cup: Yugoslavs struggle to 1-0 victory 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NANTES, France (AP) _ Three games; three losses. About the only
thing the United States came away from the World Cup was souvenirs.
	   Striking the post only 24 seconds after the opening kickoff, the
Americans looked like the stronger team for the second straight
game _ and only came away with another loss.
	   ``Goal scoring opportunities aren't easily created at the World
Cup, and goals have to be scored,'' U.S. coach Steve Sampson said
after a 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia Thursday night. ``Precision in front
of the goal is something we'll have to correct if we want to get
good results in the future.''
	   Slobodan Komljenovic headed in a rebound off a 35-meter free
kick from Sinisa Mihajlovic just over three minutes after the
opening kickoff, and Yugoslavia hung on to get a second-round
meeting with the Netherlands on Monday.
	   It was a goal that came on one of a handful of chances, while
the Americans, as they had against Iran, played most of the first
half in the Yugoslav end but came away with nothing.
	   The Yugoslavs already were all but assured of advancing, while
the Americans played only for pride. They got very little of that.
	   ``I don't think we got the best out of the talent we had here,''
said U.S. midfielder Tab Ramos, a regular on the 1990 and 1994
teams but a reserve in France. ``From the beginning, this whole
World Cup has been a mess.''
	   The Americans continued to push forward despite the goal and got
a powerful header from the top of the box out of Brian McBride that
Yugoslav keeper Ivica Kralj handled in the 15th minute.
	   Frankie Hejduk, who had the cross off the post, put another shot
on goal with a scissors kick in the 25th and the Americans
generally created more chances than the Yugoslavs.
	   But it produced nothing tangible.
	   ``The Americans played well tonight, like in their previous two
matches,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said. ``But they simply
didn't convert their chances.''
	   By the second half, Yugoslavia had figured out how to slow the
United States, and neither side looked dangerous after that.
	   ``We did what we had to do, win a match,'' Yugoslav captain
Dragan Stojkovic said. ``The Americans have such high motives to
beat us, but we are much a stronger team and we controlled the
match throughout.''
	   While the Yugoslavs live to fight another day, the Americans go
home without having won or drawn a match, and having only scored
one goal.
	   ``We started well, but unfortunately we conceded an early
goal,'' Sampson said. ``Yugoslavia is an exceptional team that will
progress far at the World Cup and I'm proud of my players and their
game tonight.''

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Florida's rejection of a controversial
tar-based fuel called Orimulsion won't stop Venezuela from trying
to market it in other U.S. states, Venezuelan officials said
Thursday.
	   ``This isn't the end of Orimulsion, just a big blow,'' said
Carlos Borregales, president of Bitor, the state-owned company that
produces it.
	   The state decided on Wednesday to deny Florida Power and Light's
bid to become the first utility in the United States to use
Orimulsion. Environmentalists praised the decision, calling the mix
of tar-like bitium and water a threat to Florida's air and water.
	   Bitor officials say the low-cost fuel is safe and is being used
in Japan, Denmark, Canada, Lithuania and Italy. China also plans to
start using it.
	   Bitor will continue negotiations to sell Orimulsion to utilities
in New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, Borregales said.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ President Arnoldo Aleman pledged
Thursday to use ``all the force of the law'' to crack down on gangs
he described as former rebels who have taken up arms anew.
	   Aleman said the national police and the military have designed a
plan to ``neutralize these criminal bands'' within three months.
The priorities of his government, he said, are to fight violence
and public insecurity, corruption and drug trafficking.
	   Army chief Gen. Joaquin Cuadra said Wednesday that former
leftist Sandinista rebels and ex-convicts have formed criminal
groups. One such band is blamed for ambushing a military patrol on
June 13, killing four soldiers.
	   In Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala _ which all suffered
civil wars in the 1980s _ former combatants are said to have
organized gangs and turned to extortion, car theft, drug
trafficking and kidnapping following the end of fighting.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Government health officials on Thursday
ordered a drug manufacturer to shut down while they investigate how
phony birth control pills packaged as real ones got to market.
	   At least four women became pregnant after taking pills made of
flour that were packaged and sold as the contraceptive Microvlar.
	   Directors of the Brazilian subsidiary of the German drug
manufacturer Schering said earlier this week that the dummy pills,
intended solely to test out new packaging equipment, had been
stolen and sold illegally.
	   Schering's laboratory will close for five days beginning Friday
and investigators will examine the area where the company packages
its products, said Ministry of Health spokeswoman Silvia Pavesi.
	   It was not clear how many dummy birth control pills were stolen.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A condemned apartment building has collapsed
in Cuba, killing at least three people. Emergency crews were
searching Thursday for more possible victims.
	   Two women and a man died Wednesday night when the three-story
building in Havana gave way, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina
said in a report monitored in Mexico City. The eight-apartment
structure had been declared inhabitable several years earlier, it
said.
	   Havana, home to about a fifth of Cuba's 11 million people, is
facing a severe housing shortage compounded by the lack of
resources to repair homes or build new ones.
	   Last year, the government passed a law requiring anyone moving
into the city to first get official approval. Violators have been
forced to return to their homes.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Three adult family members of Mexico's
most-wanted kidnapper have been transferred to a maximum security
prison, charged with organized crime, handling illicit funds and
illegal weapons possession.
	   The kidnap ring headed by fugitive Daniel Arizmendi allegedly
paid off policemen and cut gashes into the ears of its victims.
	   One former federal police officer and another alleged member of
the gang were named in the organized crime and illicit funds
charges and sent to the maximum-security Almoloya prison 35 miles
(55 kms) west of Mexico City on Wednesday.
	   Arizmendi's wife, Maria de Lourdes Arias, his son and
daughter-in-law had been under house arrest since May 21, when a
police raid largely dismantled the kidnapping ring's headquarters
in the southern city of Cuernavaca. Arizmendi escaped the raid and
remains at large.
	   Prosecutors said the three helped Arizmendi spend and invest
millions of dollars in ransoms. None of those charged Wednesday are
eligible for bail.
	   Several state authorities in Morelos, where Arizmendi operated,
resigned in recent months after top law enforcement officials were
implicated in helping and protecting kidnap rings.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A former armed forces intelligence
chief, Col. Jose Jorge Solorzano, committed suicide Thursday,
according to police.
	   Solorzano, 64, was found at his house in the Modelo suburb of
the capital. The residence faces that of former President Rafael
Leonardo Callejas.
	   Solorzano participated in the overthrow of President Ramon
Villeda Morales in 1963 and served as intelligence chief under the
man who led the coup, Gen. Oswaldo Lopez Arellano.
	   He later was chief of the presidential honor guard under Gen.
Juan Alberto Melgar, who replaced Lopez Arellano.
	   Solorzano retired in 1988 and spent most of his time at his
ranch southwest of Tegucigalpa.

French intelligence braces for nasty turn in World Cup violence news points

By CHRISTOPHER BURNS

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities fear they may not have seen the
end of World Cup violence, and that the worst may be still to come
_ a confrontation between English and German toughs.
	   So far, English and German fans have been kept apart due to
their teams playing at different venues. But hooligans from both
countries nevertheless have run amok.
	   The newspaper Le Monde on Thursday cited an intelligence memo as
saying that German extremists plan to travel to Lens, northern
France, for England's encounter with Colombia on Friday.
	   The goal: ``to combat the English enemy and try to gain the
title of `best hooligans of Europe.'''
	   The interior ministry had no immediate comment on the newspaper
report.
	   A Lens spokeswoman, Isabelle Isaert, insisted ``the kids got the
message'' when officials jailed several Germans after rioting on
Sunday. Three were quickly sentenced to a year in prison.
	   But a ministry source privately confirmed the hundreds of police
to be deployed for the match were alerted about the possibility of
German-English clashes.
	   They got a taste late Thursday when police detained 18 English
fans in the nearby city of Lille after clashes with local youths.
Four people were slightly injured, police said.
	   German police have privately said they were taking the
development seriously. They stepped up checks of France-bound
motorists by boosting their border force from about 200 to more
than 1,000 ahead of the matches Thursday and Friday.
	   Violence has shaken and tainted the five-week soccer
championship, with clashes outside stadiums leaving more than 100
injured, a policeman in a coma and an English fan in critical
condition.
	   French authorities backed by police from participating countries
have cracked down, arresting more than 250 people and deporting a
number of English and German rowdies.
	   As well as England-Colombia, Thursday's match between Germany
and Iran in Montpellier is also considered a possible flashpoint
for violence.
	   As in some of the other 10 French cities hosting the Cup, Lens
on Wednesday announced its first alcohol restrictions for Friday's
match. Officials banned its sale or possession on the streets from
8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday.
	   Five hundred police were beefing up security to 1,200 officers
Friday, along with about 100 in plainclothes. As in other matches,
thousands of fans were coming without tickets _ at least 10,000
English on Friday _ raising concerns of more drunken unrest.
	   Most of the dozen German police working in France as
hooligan-spotters were being deployed in Lens, German police said
on condition of anonymity.
	   The police are among 180 officers from the 32 nations in the
World Cup, with the largest contingent of 25 from England helping
look for fans with a track record of violence, Le Monde said.
	   Authorities were also concerned about more violence by French
North African youths after clashes with English fans in Marseille
two weeks ago.
	   Similar violence erupted Monday after the England-Romania match
in Toulouse, where police arrested a dozen local youths carrying
baseball bats.
	   An English fan was attacked, and remained in intensive care on
Wednesday. The status of Steven James Clarke, 38, of Stourbridge,
West Midlands, was ``more reassuring'' Wednesday, a hospital
statement said.

Surprising alliances emerge at UN talks on international criminal court 
</HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ In the bustling heart of Rome, a huge billboard
welcomes delegates to the U.N. conference on creating an
international war crimes tribunal. ``We expect results,'' it says.
	   Given the complexity and the political sensitivity of the
issues, it's too soon to say if the treaty talks will deliver
results by the time they end on July 17.
	   Negotiators from 159 nations are still looking for the
give-and-take on fashioning what would be the world's first
permanent court to try war crimes, crimes against humanity and
genocide.
	   ``Until now, nothing has happened which has definitely ruined
the chances of a successful conclusion of this conference,''
Hans-Paul Kaul, the head of the German delegation, said Thursday,
summing up the first two weeks.
	   ``At the same time, it's very hard to imagine that in three
weeks' time, everything will have fallen into place.''
	   Some critical forces are emerging.
	   One is the Arab League and its surprisingly determined and
cohesive support for measures many say would hamstring the court.
	   The Arab states played little part in the 3 1/2 years of arduous
preliminary negotiations that set the stage for Rome. But now,
under Egypt's guidance, they are forcefully advocating staunchly
conservative proposals.
	   ``The positions the Arab states have taken are detrimental to an
effective court, especially on the issues of crimes against
humanity and of international conflicts,'' said Jelena Pejic of the
Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights.
	   Delegates from Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America are
working shoulder-to-shoulder as the coalition pushes for a strong,
independent court.
	   Some of the key players are nations with fresh _ and bitter _
experience of the kinds of abuses the court could punish and
perhaps even deter.
	   Among them are South Africa, with its harsh history of
apartheid, and Argentina and South Korea, both of which suffered
long stretches of brutal military dictatorship.
	   ``This has infused life and strength into the negotiations,''
said Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch. ``This court is not an
abstract matter for them. They see it as an effective deterrent to
the kinds of regimes they had.''
	   Alongside these countries _ pitted against the United States on
many make-or-break issues _ are 14 of the 15 European Union nations
as well as other close U.S. allies like Canada and Australia.
	   In a sign of its growing strength, the group attracted seven new
members this week, including Jordan, which broke ranks with its
Arab neighbors.
	   The United States is in an awkward position, especially for a
country that was a moving force behind ad hoc war crimes tribunals
from Nuremberg to Rwanda. By advocating measures many say limit the
court, it finds itself estranged from old friends.

Outgoing Colombian president blasts free trade in Cuba speech 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Colombian President Ernesto Samper charged
that free trade agreements have favored rich countries at the
expense of the poor, the Cuban government's Prensa Latina news
agency reported.
	   Speaking at the University of Havana on Thursday, with Cuban
President Fidel Castro in the audience, Samper also called for
greater democracy in the United Nations, where the countries that
won World War II dominate the Security Council.
	   The Cuban agency reported that Samper said free trade in today's
world means ``the freedom of the fox to eat the hens.''
	   He said that while poor countries are reducing tariffs,
developed countries have imposed new ``much more dangerous
barriers,'' citing measures enacted by the European Union.
	   The Colombian president was combining a state visit to Cuba with
the inauguration of a meeting of health ministers by the
Non-Aligned Movement, of which he is president.
	   Samper called for limits on the veto powers of the U.N. Security
Council and said the world body should devote more resources to
social programs rather than to costly peace-keeping operations
around the world.
	   In a separate speech inaugurating the health ministers' meeting,
Samper decried the fact that the end of the Cold War had not eased
the division of the world between rich and poor countries.
	   Samper is the first Latin American head of state to visit Cuba
since a brief March 1997 trip by Peru's President Alberto Fujimori,
who was seeking Castro's help in ending a hostage standoff at the
Japanese embassy in Lima.
	   The last formal state visit by a Latin American leader was by
then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico in late 1994.
	   Samper, whose term ends in August, struggled throughout his
presidency with U.S. allegations that his presidential campaign had
been tainted by drug money.

World Cup: Iranians saddened by loss to Germany 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian soccer fans took the defeat of their
World Cup team with good grace Thursday night, disappointed that
Germany had won 2-0 but not devastated.
	   ``The team didn't play bad and such a result for a team with
little experience against one of the best teams in the world is not
too bad,'' said Mousa Alavi, a young man walking home after the
match ended at 1:30 a.m. local time (2100 GMT).
	   ``We're disappointed,'' said Farzad, a teenager strolling
friends who declined to give his surname. ``We expected them to
beat Germany and let us dance in the street.''
	   Germany's victory in the southern French town of Montpellier
meant that Iran had been knocked out of the World Cup in the first
round.
	   The defeat came only four days after Iran's triumphant 2-1 win
over the United States, a game charged with political significance
born of the hostility between Washington and Tehran since the
Islamic revolution of 1979.
	   While the game against the United States triggered an all-night
party in the streets here, Thursday's match led to clusters of
people walking home from friends' houses in a resigned mood.
	   ``We will warmly welcome the team (home) because, compared with
other Asian teams, they played much better,'' said Mehvi Sedaqat.
`` They lost two matches, but that's football.''
	   Shahla Emami, a young woman walking home with her family, said
she too would go to Tehran airport to greet the team: ``This result
is not shameful.''
	   Before the match, Iranian ambitions ran sky-high with fans
hoping that their side would deliver a stunning upset by beating
the Germans, the current European champions and a team fancied to
win the Cup.
	   Squads of teenagers took to the streets of the capital before
the game began, shouting ``IRAN'' and blowing whistles. Passing
motorists joined in the clamor, honking their horns in support of
the demanded victory.
	   During the first half, Iran played so well that a win seemed
possible. The Tehran authorities sent thousands of traffic police
on to the streets in anticipation of wild celebrations.
	   But it was not to be. Early in the second half, German strikers
Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scored goals in quick
succession and Iran never managed a comeback.
	   Yet some Iranians still found cause for national pride. Several
cars drove home with passengers waving the green, white and red
flag. One vehicle had a man waving a flag on the one side and
another man blowing a plastic trumpet on the other side.

World Cup: Clash between Red Devils lacks fire 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; UPDATES with new material
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ The game between the Red Devils at the
World Cup was decidedly lacking in fire.
	   And the result, an uninspiring 1-1 tie between Belgium and South
Korea, failed to give either team what it was looking for.
	   Belgium had gone into the match needing a win to salvage its
last hopes for a spot in the next round. In the end the result
mattered little, as Mexico tied with the Netherlands, vaulting both
teams to the next round and wiping out any Belgian chances.
	   South Korea entered the contest hoping to save face, perhaps
even getting its first World Cup win in its fifth trip.
	   Eliminated after a 3-1 loss to Mexico and a crushing 5-0 defeat
at the hands of the Dutch, the Asian team had been desperately
hoping to redeem itself against Belgium.
	   The team will now have to wait until it is co-host of the World
Cup with Japan in 2002 for another chance to prove itself.
	   ``Before we came to the World Cup we had so many hopes,'' said
South Korea's Kim Pyung-seok, promoted to head coach after Cha
Bum-kun was fired for the team's poor results through two games.
``We wanted to give our fans a boost after two demoralizing losses
by winning a match before 2002.
	   ``Regardless of the result, I think the Koreans are very proud
of our players tonight. They hung in there despite their previous
defeats.''
	   For a while it appeared the Belgians would easily get their
three points, jumping to a 1-0 lead just six miuntes into the match
on a beautiful volley by Luc Nilis past diving goalkeeper Kim
Byung-ji.
	   But Belgium's hopes were deflated with 19 minutes remaining,
when South Korean captain Yoo Sang-chul hit in a sliding shot from
a tight angle off a curling free kick from Ha Seok-ju.
	   It was the second match in a row the Belgians gave up a lead to
allow their opponents to tie. Belgium also squandered a two-goal
lead against Mexico in a 2-2 draw last Saturday, a result that
probably cost it advancement.
	   ``We didn't win a single match here,'' said Belgium goalkeeper
Philippe Vande Walle. ``It's the second time we were leading and
then let our opponents tie us. We have a serious problem.
	   ``We let our guard down too early after scoring the first
goal.''
	   Belgian coach Georges Leekens agreed.
	   ``We started well, but then collapsed after the first goal,''
said Leekens. ``We leaned back and then got the goal against us.
	   ``After that, maybe we were mentally stressed, the South Korean
players were playing so relaxed. We no longer had control over the
game.''
	   Earlier in the tournament, it had been the South Koreans who
crumbled under the slightest pressure.
	   ``When we yielded the first goal this time we kept telling
ourselves there was a lot of time left,'' said Kim. ``We saw the
match was evolving the way we wanted, so we didn't worry and it
turned out OK.''

World Cup: German victory ousts Iran, but it's been an honorable exit 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous; UPDATES with new material
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ Germany's 2-0 victory Thursday ousted
Iran from the World Cup. But it was an honorable exit for a country
that was widely expected to crumble in its first World Cup
appearance in 20 years.
	   In their three first-round games, the Iranians lost 1-0 to
highly rated Yugoslavia, beat the United States 2-1, and did not
crumble against the powerful Germans.
	   With 20 years of tension between their two governments, the
momentous victory over the United States was all the Iranians had
hoped for.
	   ``This World Cup was a great experience for us and I hope it did
a lot for the future of soccer in our country,'' said Iran coach
Jalal Talebi.
	   ``We played well against Germany, which is a stronger and more
experienced team,'' said Talebi.
	   ``After our victory against the United States, players felt that
their work was finished, and they didn't have the same motivation
tonight as they had against the United States,'' said Talebi.
	   German coach Berti Vogts admitted that it was not an easy win
against Iran.
	   ``I had said before that we have to be careful with Iran, and
tonight I was proven right,'' he said.
	   After a goal-less first half that had the Germans worried,
Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scored on a pair of headers
early in the second half.
	   The lifted the Germans to the top of Group F and a second-round
meeting Monday with second-place Group E finisher Mexico, also in
Montpellier.
	   Germany thus avoided having to play powerhouse rival the
Netherlands, which won Group E. The Dutch will meet Yugoslavia,
which finished second to Germany on goal difference after beating
the United States 1-0 in Nantes. Both teams finished with seven
points.
	   ``We tried hard in the first half, but it didn't work,'' said
Bierhoff. ``We were always afraid that Iran would somehow score.''
	   ``We played well against Yugoslavia, and performed beautifully
against the United States. Germany was just too strong,'' said
midfielder Hamid Estili, who scored the goal against the United
States.
	   ``But we're going home happy. This has been a great experience
for us, and for Iranian soccer,'' said Estili.
	   Coming to the World Cup has been something of a revival for
Iranian soccer. Iranian soccer reached its height with Iran's first
World Cup appearance in Argentina in 1978. But the Islamic
revolution a year later and the 1980-88 war with Iraq, virtually
killed the sport.
	   Some of the country's best soccer talent left, or abandoned
sports altogether in an effort to make a living.
	   In recent years, several Iranian players have made a name on
some of the world's best clubs.
	   Strikers Ali Daei, Karim Bagheri and Khodadad Azizi all play in
Germany's Bundesliga, and a fourth player, Alireza Mansourian, says
he also has an offer from a German club.
	   Mehdi Mahdavikia, Iran's rising star _ especially after scoring
the second goal against the United States _ has an offer from
Italy's Inter Milan.
	   More Iranian players are expected to be in demand with European
clubs after showing off their talent at the World Cup.
	   ``We did the best with the minimum facilities available to us
back home,'' said Talebi.

World Cup: Dutch learn timely lesson from comeback kings 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS previous
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-ETIENNE, Netherlands (AP) _ For the Dutch, the wake-up
call came in the nick of time.
	   The Netherlands raced into a 2-0 lead Thursday. They then sat
back and watched Mexico claw its way back into the match, scoring
five minutes into injury time with the last kick of the match to
equalize and earn a second-round berth.
	   Mexico takes on the winner of Group F on Monday in Montpellier.
The Netherlands, Group E winner on goal difference, takes on Group
F's runner-up the same day in Toulouse.
	   ``This is a lesson just at the right time for the second phase
of the World Cup,'' striker Dennis Bergkamp said. ``It could not
have come at a better time.''
	   Mexico will have to play its second round match without Ramon
Ramirez, who was sent off for arguing with Saudi referee Abdul Al
Zeid.
	   The talent-packed Dutch, one of the tournament favorites,
squandered their lead after putting on a show of slick, attacking
soccer in the first half.
	   ``We all had a hangover at the end,'' goalkeeper Edwin van der
Sar said. ``You should not give away a 2-0 lead. You should make it
3-0.''
	   The Dutch nearly did, as they dominated the first half, scoring
through Phillip Cocu and Ronald de Boer. Marc Overmars also sent a
delicate chip just wide of Jorge Campos' goal before the break.
	   Early in the second half Cocu, playing up front because of
Patrick Kluivert's two-match suspension, grazed the crossbar with a
20-meter (yard) shot that had Campos beaten.
	   But after that, the Netherlands sat back and allowed Mexico to
launch wave after wave of attacks.
	   Substitute Ricardo Pelaez scored for Mexico in the 75th minute,
rising above the Dutch defense to head home through a crowd of
players and then Luis Hernandez, playing with an injured ankle,
surged into the Dutch goalmouth in the 95th minute to net the
equalizer.
	   ``We learned that you must press for the full 90 minutes,''
Dutch captain Frank de Boer said. ``We lost the ball too often and
of course you can't afford to let that happen.''
	   Defender Arthur Numan agreed that the Dutch had got a shock just
on time.
	   ``It was okay now but it will not be next round,'' he said. ``We
played well in the first hour and we should have finished it off.''
	   But Mexico was determined not to let that happen. They will be
looking for more heroics from ``El Matador,'' Hernandez in the next
round.
	   ``I told my players not to lose faith,'' coach Manuel Lapuente
said. ``With faith you move mountains. They have a big heart and
they displayed that all over the field.''

World Cup: Japanese yearn to take home win with final game

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Even if they lose Friday's game against
Jamaica, the Japanese World Cup squad can go home proud, knowing
they've played well _ very well for novices.
	   ``For the players, to have a win at the World Cup or not, that's
extremely important,'' s coach Takeshi Okada told reporters
Thursday after practice amid sprinkling showers at the stadium in
Lyon.
	   ``I'd like to go back with a win. The future of Japanese soccer
is at stake,'' said 25-year-old substitute forward Masayuki Okano.
	   Japan so far has honorable 1-0 losses to the far more
experienced Argentines and Croats. But the hope is great back home
that Jamaica, also a tournament rookie, may be easier to beat.
	   ``Our problem was that we were not able to score,'' said Okada,
the coach, promising a more attack-oriented game against Jamaica.
``The Jamaican players have solid skills and outstanding physical
abilities. As a team, they are becoming very organized. But we
believe we have a chance to win.''
	   Midfielder Motohiro Yamaguchi denied he felt extra pressure to
win the final match.
	   ``Every game is the same. We will play our hearts out,'' he
said. ``We're prepared to win the next one. It'd be great if we win
every time. But no one is going to let us have easy wins.''
	   Japan has no injuries going into the final match. But defender
Eisuke Nakanishi, who has yellow cards from the first two games,
will be replaced by either Toshihide Saito or Norio Omura, the
coach said.
	   ``We were able to stay relaxed for our first two games. So we'll
play well tomorrow. We all want that win,'' said striker Masashi
Nakayama. ``It's not just for Japan. It's for myself also.''
	   Brazilian-born forward Wagner Lopes, who was sent in as a
replacement in both games, said he was eager to play again and try
to score Japan's first World Cup goal.
	   ``I'm ready,'' he said.

World Cup: Referee chief defends officials, says standard is up from '94 AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The whipping boys of the World Cup heard
unaccustomed praise, and a Norwegian web site seemed to show that
one of the tournament's most debated decisions was right on the
money.
	   Referees, blasted over the last few days by everyone from
players to government officials, were defended Thursday by their
top supervisor for making the right calls in the overwhelming
majority of cases.
	   Criticism continued in the wake of borderline calls in key
matches. The leader of African soccer said teams from the continent
were made to feel like ``undesirables.''
	   Tournament officials, however, said the mistakes that had
occurred had been honest and few.
	   Of the first 40 games, all but three featured acceptable
officiating as found in post-match reviews, according to FIFA
referee chief David Will. The below-par games were not identified
but Will said they were not affected by red cards or single moments
of borderline calls.
	   ``Of course there have been mistakes,'' Will said. ``It is
absolutely impossible to go through 40 matches without there being
mistakes.''
	   Will said the last World Cup in 1994 in the United States
produced four unsatisfactorily refereed matches, all in the first
round when there were fewer games than in this edition.
	   Overall, referees are averaging grades of 8.3 out of 10, with
the grades rising in the last week, Will said. Most have received 8
or 9, a solid ``B.''
	   He said the grades would be used in picking refs for later
rounds.
	   ``We are looking for calls that are strong, good, effective and
proper. We will retain good referees.''
	   Will's comments at a news conference came amid a torrent
criticism of the referees.
	   Players and coaches said they were inconsistent. FIFA president
Sepp Blatter said they were too soft on hard fouls. A government
minister in Cameroon said they were part of an anti-African plot.
	   Will said they were doing their job well.
	   Replays had found evidence to support one of the most argued
calls of the Cup, Will said.
	   Esse Baharmast of the United States called a foul on Junior
Baiano of Brazil that set up the winning penalty kick in Norway's
2-1 victory Tuesday. That moved Norway into the second round and
eliminated Morocco, a 3-0 winner over Scotland.
	   Initial replays failed to show a clear foul. But Will pointed to
photos taken from the Norwegian television network NRK, and
distributed on NRK's web site, that show Baiano clearly grabbing
the jersey of the Norwegian player T.A. Flo in the penalty area.
	   Baharmast's call came hours after Hungarian referee Laszlo
Vagner nullified a goal that would have put Cameroon ahead of Chile
2-1, where replays showed contact, but no clear foul. The 1-1 tie,
coupled with Italy's 2-1 victory over Austria, meant Chile advanced
and Cameroon was out.
	   On Thursday, the African Football Confederation said its teams
had been singled out for ``special treatment,'' adding that the
rules were not evenly applied.
	   ``Faced with this situation, all of African soccer suffers from
a profound unease: A feeling that her representatives are
undesirables on the grandest stage of soccer on the planet,''
confederation general secretary Mustapha Fahmy said.
	   Will dismissed charges of political favoritism as ``just
ridiculous.''
	   ``The referees are not the slightest bit interested in the
political situation,'' he said. ``They are simply refereeing the
game. They don't even known who the two teams are.''

World Cup: Tunisia looking to regain face in final match against Romania 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS, France (AP) _ Eliminated from the tournament and with
nothing to lose, Tunisia's match against Romania will be a
face-saving venture for the team, Tunisia's new coach said
Thursday.
	   ``We have nothing left to lose in this World Cup, so in the
match against Romania, we're going to simply focus on playing the
best game we can,'' Ali el-Selmi told The Associated Press.
	   ``It's going to be a match in which we hone our skills and try
to honor Tunisian and Arab football with a good performance against
a strong team,'' he said.
	   El-Selmi, who has been with the team for four years, took over
as head coach after Henri Kasperczak, a Pole, was fired following
Tunisia's second straight loss in the competition. The first was a
2-0 defeat by England and the second, a 1-0 upset by Colombia.
	   El-Selmi said that Kasperczak's dismissal had not had affected
the team's morale or preparations for its final match against
Romania.
	   ``With one match to go for us, it didn't make sense to find a
foreign coach to lead the team,'' he said, adding that ``Nobody is
really feeling the difference.''
	   ``I'm a Tunisian, and I'm ready to accept the responsibility and
the players are ready to do their best,'' said el-Selmi.
	   Though eliminated, the players say that they are approaching
this match as they would any other.
	   ``Romania is a tough team. They have excellent players and
function well as a team,'' said team captain Sami Trabelsi. ``We're
taking this match very seriously. It won't be easy.''
	   Trabelsi admitted that while the pressure to qualify was off,
they now faced an equally daunting task _ proving that what
happened in the first two matches is not representative of the
standard of Tunisian football.
	   ``Tunisia has waited 20 years to compete again in this
tournament. We had some bad luck at the start, but still have one
match to prove that our place in the World Cup was well-deserved,''
he said.
	   ``We're going to make the most of this opportunity so that in
the next Cup, God willing, we get off to a better start and qualify
for the second round.''

World Cup: Favored teams avoid each other in chase for quarterfinal AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: will be updated with Friday's matches
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup quarterfinals beckon and the fancied
teams are all avoiding each other.
	   Brazil and Italy both won their groups to make sure there won't
be a repeat of the 1994 final in the second round. Now they won't
meet again unless they both make it the final once more.
	   If the Brazilians beat South American rival Chile at the Parc
des Princes in round two on Saturday they will face the winner of
Sunday's game at Saint-Denis between Olympic champion Nigeria, the
only one of five African nations to make it to the last 16, and
1992 European titlist Denmark.
	   A Brazil-Nigeria quarterfinal would bring together two teams
with hugely talented attacks but suspect defenses.
	   Brazil has quality players like Ronaldo, Bebeto, Denilson up
front with Leonardo, Rivaldo, Cafu and Roberto Carlos attacking
from deep. The Nigerians, who downed a very strong Brazilian team
in the Olympic semifinal two years ago, have Nwankwo Kanu, Victor
Ikpeba, Augustine ``Jay Jay'' Okocha, Daniel Amokachi, Tijana
Babangida and Rasheed Yekini among their attacking lineup.
	   Provided the Italians down Norway at Marseille Saturday, Cesare
Maldini's improving team goes to Saint-Denis in the quarterfinal to
meet either host France or Paraguay, who meet Sunday at Lens.
	   An Italy-France quarterfinal looks most likely from those
matchups and that would mean the freescoring French welcoming back
star forward Zinedine Zidane from a two-match suspension against
some of his Juventus colleagues, including fit-again Alessandro Del
Piero.
	   In the other half of the second round draw, Germany topped Group
F to meet Mexico for a place in the last eight and second place
Yugoslavia must face the Netherlands in a matchup of two teams who
have a lot of talent but lack consistency.
	   Banned from the last World Cup as well as two European
Championships because of the nation's involvement in the wars in
Croatia and Bosnia, the Yugoslavs made the quarterfinal on their
last appearance in 1990 before going out to the eventual losing
finalist Argentina in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie.
	   Germany, a three-time winner and European champion which still
has many of the players who won the title eight years ago, should
have too much experience for the Mexicans, who only made the last
16 Thursday thanks to a goal in the final seconds of injury time in
a 2-2 tie with the Dutch.
	   The last two second round matchups were finalised Friday.
	   Argentina and Croatia met in Bordeaux to decide who won Group H
and who finished second. Japan and Jamaica, who met at Lyon, are
already out.
	   Romania has already made it to the second round but didn't know
whether it would go into the last 16 as Group G winner.
	   The Romanians, with a three-point advantage, looked favorites to
finish top and faced already eliminated Tunisia at Saint-Denis
Friday while England and Colombia, both with three points, met at
Lens to fight over the other second round place.
	   If the standings positions remained the same, Argentina would
meet England in round two, thus avoiding Germany in the
quarterfinal, but facing the winner of Netherlands-Yugoslavia.
	   Romania would meet debutant Croatia to set up a likely
quarterfinal against the Germans.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks slip in early trading 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar jumped against the yen early Friday as
Japanese investors bought the U.S. currency in the absence of any
signs of intervention. Tokyo stock prices edged higher.
	   The dollar bought 142.44 yen, up 1.52 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of 142.30 yen
overnight.
	   Traders said Japanese institutional investors, banks and
overseas funds, bought dollars at the start of the Tokyo session.
	   The buying was inspired in part by the lack of yen-supportive
intervention late Thursday in New York, despite the dollar's
advance to a high of 142.35.
	   That was the dollar's highest level since June 17, the day
Japanese and U.S. financial authorities bought yen to halt the
Japanese currency's slide to eight-year lows. The dollar has now
recouped nearly all the losses it posted since the intervention.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 96.76 points, or 0.64 percent, to 15,035.46 points in the
first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday, the Nikkei average gained
9.04 points, or 0.06 percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 3.46 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,182.07. The
TOPIX closed up 4.60 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before.
	   Stocks started lower amid concerns about the weakness of the yen
and the recent trend toward higher domestic short-term interest
rates, which reflect worries about credit risks at Japanese banks.
	   Shares of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan rose to 62
yen in early trading, up 4 yen from Thursday's close.
	   LTCB, one of Japan's three credit banks, has become the focus of
concern recently among investors as Japanese banks struggle to
dispose a pile of bad debts, left from the collapse of the
speculative real estate prices in early 1990s.
	   On Thursday, LTCB executives spelled out a drastic restructuring
plan and hinted at a possible merger at the bank's annual
shareholders' meeting.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.240 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.220 percent,
driving its price down to 111.66 yen from 111.81 yen.

Fortunes change quickly for some, not at all for others

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It only took 19 minutes to change the fortunes of
three teams; a full 90 couldn't do anything for four more.
	   Two second-half goals by Mexico, and another by South Korea,
rescued the Latin Americans, and sent them and the Netherlands into
the second round of the World Cup Thursday, while simultaneously
squashing Belgians seemingly promising chances.
	   By nightfall, the Germans clinically beat the Iranians 2-0,
extinguishing the Persians' hopes, and advanced as expected as the
Group F winner. And, despite hitting the post again, the Americans
couldn't buy a goal and exited the tournament in a 1-0 loss to the
Yugoslavs, which settled for second place and a second-round berth.
	   ``I am happy. It was an unbelievable game,'' said Luis
Hernandez, whose goal in the fifth minute of injury time gave
Mexico a 2-2 draw with the Netherlands. ``It was a fantastic game
for us. A triumph for Mexico and the Mexican people.''
	   Ricardo Pelaez scored in the 75th minute, starting Mexico's
rally from a two-goal deficit for the second time in as many
matches.
	   Tied with Dutch on points entering the match, and ahead of
Belgium by two points, Mexico supposedly had the toughest task of
reaching the second round. Belgium, after all, had the lightly
regarded South Koreans.
	   With the Netherlands leading 2-0 in Saint-Etienne, and Belgians
up 1-0 in Paris, the experts seemed to have it right.
	   But Yoo Sang-chul equalized for South Korea in the 71st, and the
soccer world began to change.
	   With both games played simultaneously, Yoo's goal drew South
Korea even with Belgium enroute to a 1-1 draw.
	   Then, just to make sure, Paleaz scored and Hernandez added his
third goal of the World Cup to send Mexico into the second round
with a bit of momentum.
	   They'll probably need it. Mexico will get Germany on Monday in
Montpellier while the Netherlands will face off against Yugoslavia
in Toulouse.
	   ``I told my players not to lose faith,'' coach Manuel Lapuente
said. ``With faith you move mountains. They have a big heart and
they displayed that all over the field.''
	   The second round pairings were to be completed on Friday when
Romania faced Tunisia and England took on Colombia in Group G,
while in Group H it was Argentina versus Croatia. Japan played
Jamaica in a match that had no bearing on anything except final
positions.
	   Position was, in effect, all that Group F played for. With four
points each Germany and Yugoslavia had all but sewn up berths in
the second round. Iran could qualify if it upset the Germans, but
all the Americans could do was play for pride.
	   In Montpellier, Oliver Bierhoff and Juergen Klinsmann scored
early in the second half and Germany squashed any Iranian hopes,
and the Yugoslavs scored less than four minutes after kickoff and
then had to struggle to fend off the Americans.
	   ``We tried hard in the first half, but it didn't work,''
Bierhoff said. ``We were always afraid that Iran would somehow
score.
	   ``We played better in the second half and after we scored the
first goal, things opened up a bit. We tried to come over the
flanks and cross and finally it worked when Thomas (Haessler)
crossed the ball over to me.''
	   In Nantes, the Americans hit the post after only 24 seconds, but
came away frustrated again when Slobodan Komljenovic headed in a
rebound off a free kick from Sinisa Mihalovic.
	   ``We wanted to win an end the qualifications with a victory and
that was our only aim,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
``The game was not flamboyant, I know, but that is how you play
good matches.''
	   Yugoslavia scrambled to thwart the American forays throughout
the first 45 minutes, but by the second half it had figured out how
to stifle the United States, but didn't do much more itself.
	   The second straight good effort by the Americans did little to
salve their frustration.
	   ``I don't think we got the best out of the talent we had here,''
said American midfielder Tab Ramos, a regular on the 1990 and 1994
teams but relegated to a reserve in France. ``From the beginning,
this whole World Cup has been a mess.''
	   Others were referring to the referees in the World Cup as a
mess, but FIFA thinks otherwise, and went on the offensive Thursday
to defend their men in everything-but-black.
	   ``We remain generally satisfied with the performance of the
referees,'' said David Will, a Scottish lawyer who has run FIFA's
referee office for eight years. ``The overall standard remains high
_ higher than in the United States, to be sure.''
	   Overall officiating in the first 40 games was rated at an
average 8.3 points out of 10, and marks were getting better as the
tournament progressed, he said.
	   It did little to appease some, who accused FIFA of a conspiracy
against African nations. Only one of five African teams advanced
past the first round.
	   The African Football Confederation claimed teams from its
continent had been victimized by ``one-sided'' refereeing and urged
FIFA to ``repair prejudice.''
	   The Africans apparently were most upset at American referee Esse
Baharmast, whose penalty call in the 89th minute helped give Norway
a 2-1 victory over Brazil on Tuesday, sending the Scandinavians
through and knocking out Morocco.
	   Initial replays showed contact but no clear foul. But Will
pointed to photos taken from the Norwegian television network NRK
that show Baiano clearly grabbing the jersey of the Norwegian
player, Tore Andre Flo, in the penalty area.

	   BAFATA, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ A rusting single-action rifle at
his side, a brown militia man's cap on his head, an aging guerrilla
peers out from a concrete bunker.
	   Gazing across peanut fields and off into the horizon, he's a
``camarada,'' or comrade, from Guinea-Bissau's 1960s independence
war who has been pressed back into service in this African
country's newest conflict. A romantic filled with the rhetoric of
Cuban hero Ernesto ``Che'' Guevera, he's back in his element.
	   Decades ago, Portuguese troops were under siege in the capital
Bissau while peasant guerrillas ruled the countryside. Today, a
similar scenario is shaping up with the country's unpopular
president under fire in this brief and tragic war.
	   In the rice and peanut fields, in sleepy provincial towns, the
``camaradas'' are riding again.
	   With Guinea-Bissau's army split between loyalist and rebellious
forces in a capital battered with daily artillery fire, the bulk of
the soldiers from both sides are camped out in or around the city.
	   In the countryside, though, security, propaganda and
revolutionary rhetoric are left to the ``camaradas.''
	   Across the country, from the border with Senegal to the Atlantic
coast, aging guerrillas are coming out of retirement this time
against their own president, Joao Bernardo Vieira, himself a
veteran and hero.
	   Mamading Tcham, a 64-year-old veteran of the independence war,
says he's ready to fight again.
	   ``What we had at the time of war was suffering but we also had
happiness to be free,'' he says, shuffling to his feet with a
timeworn Russian-made assault rifle in his hand.
	   In rubber flip-flop sandals and straw sun hat, Tcham says all
the men in his former militia regiment have volunteered to fight.
	   ``Nino isn't with the people anymore,'' he says, using Vieira's
nickname. ``Brother, we just need some justice.''
	   A part-time security guard, Tcham says he has rejoined the
struggle for his country _ a struggle that first ended in 1975 when
Guinea-Bissau won its independence from Portugal after 14 years of
war.
	   Now he says, the people must get rid of Vieira, who many accuse
of widespread corruption and mismanagement.
	   Tcham _ known by his guerrilla nickname ``little 49'' _ says he
remembers well the struggle against the Portuguese and insists he's
able and willing to head back into the forests.
	   Vieira, a senior commander with the African Party for
Independence in Guinea and Cape Verde, was a vanguard member of the
revolution and a chosen favorite to lead the country after
independence.
	   He came to power in 1980, when then-President Louis Cabral _
from the nearby island of Cape Verde _ was assassinated during a
coup.
	   Many say Vieira has never been able to alleviate the country of
wrenching poverty, and anger has boiled over with the president and
his personal fortune.
	   A groundswell of anti-Vieira sentiment is emerging in much of
this tiny West African nation, where a popular folk song has become
the new revolution's anthem.
	   ``We are all in this boat together,'' folk singer Justino Del
Gado's new hit says. ``If the boat goes down, Nino, you go down
too.''
	   While most people make somewhere between dlrs 150 and dlrs 250 a
year in Guinea-Bissau, Vieira was jetting for private weekends in
Lisbon and Paris.
	   ``You could see it, you would go to the capital and see his
fancy cars and his fancy palace,'' says businessman Geraldo Sariot.
``There was never any middle class, only Vieira's riches and the
poor. Without a middle class, forget it man, it will blow up.''
	   Blow up it did.

	   RANCHO EL PITALLO, Mexico (AP) _ The cactuses and the cowboys
expect little rain on the hard ranges of northern Mexico. But with
a bad drought in its fifth year, even the cactuses are dry. The
cowboys are desperate.
	   ``The only solution is that it rains,'' rancher Mario Moreno
says. ``The cattlemen can ask that only of the skies, and from
above.''
	   Thin and thirsting, thousands of cattle have died in the
country's worst drought in 70 years. Ranchers are whittling down
their herds to survive _ many selling off calves to the United
States.
	   The drought hit central and southern Mexico more recently, a
rarity blamed on the El Nino shift in weather patterns, but its
impact is severe.
	   In hot central states, children are dying of dehydration. In the
south, wildfires recently tore through dried out rain forest and
corn crops have shriveled.
	   At May's end, Mexico this year had received an average 2.2
inches (55 mm) of rain, 54 percent below the norm. Reservoirs in
central Mexico are at 15 percent capacity, and at 20 percent in the
north.
	   In Sonora, a northern border state known for its roughened
desert cowboys, there have been only sparse showers since 1992.
	   ``It's a truly sad situation,'' says Jesus Ancheta Molina of the
state's regional cattlemen's union in Hermosillo, the state
capital. ``This is a state which shows that the people fight. Our
activity is very traditional, filled with pride.''
	   On Rancho El Pitallo, a hard scratch of land 50 miles (80 kms)
east of Hermosillo, Moreno and his brothers own 200 head of cattle.
They are among the small ranchers said to be worst hit by the
drought.
	   Grunting ``Hu! _ Ha!,'' Moreno drives his cows on a walk for
scant forage. Young calves eagerly lap up whey dripping from a bag
of fresh cheese hanging from the ranch hand's shack.
	   Altogether, 200 people share 45,700 acres (18,500 hectares) on
and surrounding Rancho El Pitallo. Such cooperatives, called
``ejidos,'' were allocated in the aftermath of the 1910-17
revolution and typically made from less productive land.
	   The drought has turned the earth into pale dirt. Without grass,
Moreno and the others must buy hay and vitamins, and sell cattle to
come up with the money.
	   ``This is not a business,'' Moreno says with a sigh.
	   The ejido has 1,500 head of cattle _ the remaining half of what
has been sold off in the last two years, Moreno says.
	   Across Sonora, the number of cattle has dropped by a third since
1994, Ancheta says while ranchers in jeans and boots auction off
cattle behind his Hermosillo office.
	   Sonora is the top state in exporting calves to the United
States, where they are fattened on feed lots, and second only to
neighboring Chihuahua state in overall cattle production.
	   Before the drought, Mexico exported an average 1 million calves
a year. That jumped to 1.4 million in 1995 when the drought and the
1994 peso devaluation left ranchers struggling, says Chuck Lambert,
chief economist for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in
Washington.
	   With herds depleted, the number sank to 420,000 in 1996 and was
still at a low 622,000 last year. Though herds have yet to recover,
exports are on track to reach 800,000 this year, Lambert says _ an
indication that future cattle supplies will be limited.
	   Even if it were to begin pouring tomorrow, it will take three or
four years to recover. The drought has hurt the quality of grass
produced, making it harder for cows to gain weight and support
pregnancies, says Eduardo Salcedo Martinez, state deputy secretary
for cattle development.
	   Mexico's National Cattlemen's Confederation says thousands of
cattle have died across Mexico, though it has no exact numbers.
	   Crops have died, too. The Agriculture Ministry expects Mexico
will need to import about 14.5 million tons (13.5 million metric
tons) of grain this year, a 17 percent increase from 1997.
	   In Chiapas, the primary coffee-producing state, more than half
of the 1998-99 crop is expected to be lost.
	   Dozens of children have been reported dead from dehydration as
heat waves pushed temperatures above 100 degrees (40 C) in some
states.
	   The government has said it will spend more than 300 million
pesos (dlrs 35 million) to help build water tanks and deliver
monetary and food aid.
	   With El Nino said to be dying out, rains may be coming. But
meteorologists say a new phenomenon, a cooling of Pacific waters
known as ``La Nina,'' is on the way.
	   Thin clouds graze the summer sky above Sonora, but they are only
a tease. Alejandro Manza Figueroa, Moreno's neighbor at the Rancho
El Pozo _ Spanish for ``The Well'' _ tampers any optimism.
	   A well pump the government installed in 1974 worked only a year
before the well went dry, Manza says. A 300-foot-deep
(100-meter-deep) well dug later with a pickax now holds just a bit
of dirty water.
	   For drinking and cooking, Manza fills a barrel with water driven
in from a nearby town. But each trip costs him 30 pesos (dlrs 3.50)
in gas.
	   ``We don't have the means to be spending so much,'' he says,
wearing a faded and torn shirt. ``We are poor people.''
	   Looking up, he judges the hazy sky.
	   ``Well, here come the little clouds. Hopefully it will rain.
They announce water, but don't say when.
	   ``How does it look to you?'' he asks with a sad laugh.

MARSEILLE: Cup opener. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Australia's outback, some die-hard fans wound up driving
hundreds of kilometers (miles) for a TV when broadcast coverage
didn't reach them. ``The guys on the Mir space station can watch it
and we can't,'' Ian Cuthbertson grumbled to one Australian
newspaper.
	   TV salesmen couldn't be happier.
	   ``I wish the World Cup were held every year,'' said Nguyen Viet
Hung, who more than doubled TV sales to 50 a day at his Hanoi shop.
	   Sets even appeared in some classrooms in Lima, Peru, where
teachers feared a dramatic drop-off in attendance.
	   ``The World Cup is what's on the mind of the students, so why
not use it as a teaching tool?'' explained Arturo Sinches,
principal at the Republic of Paraguay elementary school.
	   Students were asked to write reports on the World Cup and study
the history and geography of the teams. They even learned some
French, saying ``bonjour'' and ``au revoir'' to one another.
	   In some factories and workplaces, soccer stopped production.
	   Brazilian's main stock market vowed to fight the tide and remain
open. But it ended up suspending trading during Brazil's
first-round matches. Foreign investors ``can complain all they
want, but it won't change anything,'' said one broker, Alberto
Alves Sobrihno.
	   Four big automakers in Brazil shut down _ either completely or
partially _ during that country's games. An estimated 8,400
autoworkers paused for Brazil's opening game.
	   Workers are making up for lost production by by working through
lunch breaks, on Saturdays or adding hours during the week.
Downtown, each victory is an excuse to samba in the streets,
carnival-style.
	   After early morning broadcasts of South Korea's games, a
construction company gave workers time off, concerned that a lack
of sleep would cause accidents.
	   Britain, beset by worker absences and a daylong subway strike,
was nearly paralyzed by its first game. World Cup fever even
spilled into a summit of European Union leaders in Cardiff, Wales.
	   The talks didn't stop, but British Prime Minister Tony Blair had
updates delivered to the politicians at regular intervals.
	   Even highbrows in Norway couldn't resist their nation's opener:
the Trondheim orchestra sold only 50 tickets for an evening of
Schubert _ until it promised that the performance would be over by
game time. Then about 200 people showed up.
	   ``This way, fans of music and soccer could enjoy both,'' said
Siri F. Mathisen, the symphony's managing director. Like everyone
else, he rushed home to see Norway play.

Hasek cleans up at NHL awards banquet again 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Dominik Hasek, who sparked the Czech Republic to
an Olympic gold medal in February and helped Buffalo to the Eastern
Conference finals, repeated as most valuable player and top goalie
in the National Hockey League as the league held its annual awards
banquet.
	   Hasek on Thursday became the first goalie to win the Hart trophy
as MVP two years in a row and also got the Vezina award as best
goaltender for the fourth time in five years.
	   He completed a hat trick by repeating as the Pearson trophy
winner, an MVP award voted upon by his fellow players. The media
votes on the Hart trophy, the 26 NHL general managers on the
Vezina, and members of the players union on the Pearson.
	   ``It was a good year, but I believe I can play better,'' said
Hasek, 33, who had a 33-23-13 record during the regular season,
with 13 shutouts, a 2.09 goals-against average, and a .932 save
percentage.
	   Despite the awards and the Olympic gold medal, Hasek said the
season wasn't complete ``because the Sabres did not go far enough
in the playoffs. It was a great season for me, but you can never be
pleased unless you win the last game.''
	   Buffalo was eliminated in six games by Washington in the Eastern
Conference finals.
	   Pat Burns of Boston became the first in league history to be
named coach of the year with three teams, after winning the Adams
trophy with Montreal in 1989 and Toronto in 1993.
	   ``To win it three different times with three Original Six teams
is something I'm very proud of,'' Burns said. ``There's a lot of
people to thank along the way.''
	   Also, Rob Blake of Los Angeles won the Norris Trophy as top
defenseman, Sergei Samsonov of Boston the Calder as rookie of the
year, Jere Lehtinen of Dallas the Frank J. Selke Trophy as top
defensive forward and Ron Francis of Pittsburgh the Lady Byng as
most gentlemanly player. He also won it in 1995.
	   Jamie McLennan, St. Louis' backup goalie, won the Bill Masterton
Trophy for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.
McLennan, 26, overcame a life-threatening bout of bacterial
meningitis two years ago. He had to learn how to walk again, yet
made it back to the NHL.
	   Kelly Chase of St. Louis won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for
leadership on and off the ice. Chase's signature charitable effort
is the Gateway Special Hockey Program, allowing children and young
adults born with developmental disabilities such as Down's Syndrome
and autism to participate in organized hockey.
	   The league's all-star first team was made up of Hasek in goal,
Blake and Nicklas Lidstrom of Detroit on defense, and Colorado's
Peter Forsberg, Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr and Philadelphia's John
LeClair up front.

Tense waiting game for results to Northern Ireland election 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS pvs. Timing of first results uncertain.
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Armored cars delivered
thousands of ballot boxes to election centers Friday where a slow
count will determine who will sit in Northern Ireland's new
cross-community government.
	   The outcome to Thursday's complex election for a 108-seat
Assembly will have profound implications for the Belfast peace
agreement, struck in April among eight parties but opposed by two
Protestant parties committed to blocking compromise.
	   Under terms of the agreement, the Assembly will require votes by
consensus across the sectarian divide, but an exit poll indicated
that Protestant hard-liners led by the Rev. Ian Paisley fared well.
	   The bombastic Paisley predicted that his Democratic Unionists
and other anti-agreement Protestants would win enough seats to form
an obstructionist bloc in the Assembly, but other parties doubted
this.
	   The Assembly must implement key elements of the agreement, such
as the nomination of a 12-member administration of Protestants and
Catholics alike. These decisions must be approved by majorities of
both sides' members.
	   Electoral officials estimated the turnout of Northern Ireland's
1.18 million eligible voters at about 65 percent, average in this
highly politicized society _ but well down on the 81 percent who
voted in last month's straightforward ``yes'' or ``no'' referendum
to ratify the agreement.
	   Politicians attributed the lackluster turnout to the cautious
campaigns waged by most parties and to ``ballot fatigue,'' the fact
that the public had already endured four votes in the past two
years of almost nonstop debate.
	   Ever since 71 percent of Northern Ireland voters said ``yes''
May 22, Paisley and the leader of the major Protestant party, David
Trimble, have argued about the significance of the 29 percent of
voters, overwhelmingly Protestant, who voted no.
	   Trimble, whose support for the agreement has badly split his
Ulster Unionist Party, insisted that most Protestants voted yes and
would back his own support for the agreement in the Assembly
election.
	   But Thursday's exit polling of about 800 voters painted a
picture of a Protestant community profoundly split on the merits of
compromise.
	   The Ulster Unionists scored 20 percent of first-preference
votes, the Democratic Unionists 19 percent, in the poll
commissioned by Irish broadcasters RTE and the Irish Times
newspaper.
	   Paisley's smaller but just as stubborn ally, the United Kingdom
Unionist Party, attracted 4 percent, according to the survey. Two
parties that represent pro-British Protestant paramilitary groups
and support the agreement also received 4 percent.
	   On the Catholic side, the moderate Social Democratic and Labor
Party had 25 percent support in the poll, compared with 13 percent
to its militant rival, the IRA-allied Sinn Fein.
	   Political analysts cautioned, however, that the exit poll had a
margin of error of 5 percent and was based only on the first half
of the survey, from morning until mid-afternoon.
	   The full polling results were expected to be published Friday
morning. But that won't answer the question of how many seats will
each party win.
	   The official count could take all of Friday, and possibly part
of Saturday, because of the sheer number of candidates _ 296 _
whose votes have to be counted, eliminated and transferred in a
highly democratic but painstaking ``proportional representation''
system.
	   The system allows voters to mark candidates in each district in
order of preference. Ballots marked ``1'' for certain candidates _
either those at the top or the bottom of the popularity table _
have their second preferences registered with other candidates.
	   It means that a party could win a higher, or lower, percentage
of seats than its share of first-preference votes suggest. In the
case of Ulster Unionists, for instance, their candidates may
benefit from lower-preference votes provided by moderate Catholics
who want to ensure that pragmatic Protestants, rather than Paisley,
prevail in the Assembly.
	   Six winners will be declared in each of Northern Ireland's 18
electoral districts. The Assembly is expected to meet for the first
time Tuesday in Stormont, the center of British administration for
Northern Ireland.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ With the successful exchange of war dead,
Israel and Lebanon now enter the second stage of a swap: Israel's
release of 60 Lebanese prisoners.
	   Israel planned to release the prisoners on Friday at a crossing
point in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. Some of the prisoners
have been held as long as 13 years.
	   An Israeli government statement said that none of the prisoners
to be released had ``blood on their hands.''
	   The releases follow the exchange Thursday of the bodies of 40
Lebanese guerrillas and the remains of an Israeli soldier killed in
fighting in south Lebanon.
	   Lebanon received the bodies of the mostly Hezbollah fighters,
including the son of the guerrilla movement's leader Sheik Hassan
Nasrallah, with full military honors late Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri led the ceremony at Beirut airport,
reflecting the government's recognition of the Shiite Muslim
militants as national heroes.
	   ``We welcome today, with all respect, the bodies of a group of
our martyred children who return to the land where they grew up,
whose freedom they fought for and died for,'' Hariri said.
	   Lebanese soldiers carried the 40 coffins, wrapped in the
Lebanese flag, out of the French military transport plane that had
flown them from Tel Aviv, Israel.
	   The bodies were to be buried in a funeral Saturday. Twenty-eight
of the dead had been members of Hezbollah, nine belonged to the
Amal movement, and three to the Lebanese Communist Party.
	   Less than five hours earlier, Lebanon had loaded on to the same
aircraft the remains of Israeli Sgt. 1st Class Itamar Ilya, a naval
commando killed in a botched raid in the south in September. Later,
Israel received him with full honors at a military airport outside
Tel Aviv.
	   ``It's a mitzvah (Good deed) to return him to his family, to his
country,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Israel before
Ilya's body arrived.
	   But the swap yielded nothing to Israel about the prisoner it has
sought the longest, air navigator Ron Arad.
	   Hariri said at the airport that if he knew where Arad was, he
would have negotiated to exchange him. Hezbollah's Nasrallah made a
similar remark recently.
	   Arad was captured by guerrillas in 1986 after his plane was shot
down during a bombing mission over south Lebanon. He is believed to
still be alive.
	   International Committee of the Red Cross delegate Jean-Jacques
Fresard, who struck the deal in 10 months of tortuous negotiations,
oversaw the exchange, traveling both ways on the 50-minute flight
between Beirut and Tel Aviv.
	   ``This is going to make a number of families extremely happy so,

World Cup: Dozens arrested after celebration turns unruly

	   HUNTINGTON PARK, California (AP) _ Dozens were arrested Thursday
when a disturbance erupted as more than 1,000 people crowded
downtown streets to celebrate Mexico's advance to the second round
of World Cup soccer.
	   Revelers tried to rock a transit bus, bashed a pickup truck and
jumped on cars. Some store windows were broken and there was minor
vandalism.
	   Local police were quickly reinforced by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department and other agencies.
	   Thirty-one people were arrested for various crimes, mostly for
misdemeanor failure to disperse, said Deputy Bob Killeen. He said
there would be more arrests as the crowd was cleared.
	   The celebration began about 9:30 a.m. and continued hours later,
even after officers blocked a dozen intersections and ordered
people to go home. Officers marched elbow-to-elbow down streets in
an effort to scatter the crowd.
	   About 320 officers _ 180 sheriff's deputies _ and those from
neighboring police departments helped Huntington Park police as the
boisterous crowd gathered on Pacific Boulevard and Florence Avenue
in the small city southeast of Los Angeles.
	   Revelers waved red, white and green Mexican flags and shouted
``Viva Mexico'' as they crowded the business district. Despite the
vandalism there was no looting, Killeen said.
	   ``I think most of the soccer fans don't celebrate this way,''
said business owner George Vitale, who suffered about dlrs 1,000
damage to his shattered shop windows. ``I think some of the kids
are taking advantage of the situation.''
	   The celebration brought out deputies in riot gear and armed with
crowd-control weapons. A mobile booking unit to handle arrests in
the field was also dispatched.
	   Some youths threw objects at officers. Others yelled and drank
alcohol.
	   There were no reported injuries, Killeen said.
	   Mayor Jessica Maes was in the crowd and pleaded with revelers to
have fun but not to immitate violent soccer hooligans.
	   ``I just want to tell everybody we need to have a good time, but
positively,'' she said. ``We don't want any trouble. We're afraid
that some people might get hurt.''
	   At the World Cup competition in France, Mexico rallied from a
2-0 deficit in the final 15 minutes to tie the Netherlands 2-2
Thursday, qualifying both teams for the second round.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Sammy Sosa broke the U.S. Major League Baseball
record for home runs in a month Thursday night, hitting his 19th of
June in the seventh inning of the Chicago Cubs' game against the
Detroit Tigers.
	   Sosa, who has 32 homers overall, broke the mark set by Detroit's
Rudy York in August 1937. On Tuesday night, Sosa broke the National
League record of 17 set by San Francisco's Willie Mays in August
1965.
	   Sosa's blast off Tigers starter Brian Moehler was an
opposite-field drive to the upper deck in right field leading off
the seventh. Sosa has connected 12 times in his last 13 games. He
has 23 homers and 45 RBIs in the last 26 games.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Popular Algerian singer Lounes Matoub,
an outspoken critic of this North African country's violent
insurgency, has been killed by assailants near his Berber hometown.
	   In a brief statement, Algeria's security forces said the
42-year-old singer was ``cowardly assassinated'' and shot several
times.
	   He had recently returned to Algeria from exile after surviving a
kidnapping by Muslim militants.
	   Matoub, who like other Berbers fiercely criticized both the
military-backed government and Islamic militants, was killed
outside the village of Oued Aissi, near the Berber regional capital
of Tizi-Ouzou in eastern Algeria.
	   It was the latest assassination of an Algerian artist during a
6-year-old Muslim insurgency that has claimed more than 75,000
lives.
	   Witnesses said his wife and two sisters-in-law were also wounded
in the attack and were hospitalized.
	   They said Matoub's car was stopped at a false roadblock, but
that the singer drove on. The assailants then showered the car with
bullets. They said he was shot three times in the head.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   Living in exile in France since his 1994 kidnapping, Matoub had
only returned to Algeria this month. The militants have killed
other singers including Cheb Hasni, as well as intellectuals.
	   ``He had the courage to denounce, to speak out,'' Algeria's
best-known singer Cheb Khaled said in a radio interview in France,
where he lives in exile. ``It's not over. ... The situation is
still critical.''
	   ``When you silence a journalist or an artist, you're silencing
the people,'' he added.
	   Malika Matoub, the victim's sister, said in a separate radio
interview that ``his songs will speak for him.''
	   ``They'll never kill him. He'll remain engraved in people's
memories,'' she said. ``He's immortal.''
	   Matoub was kidnapped Sept. 25, 1994, by the Armed Islamic Group,
the insurgency's most violent movement. He was freed two weeks
later with a letter from the group, demanding the Berbers support
the militants.
	   In other violence, security forces killed 18 Muslim militants
and five civilians were slain, according to reports Thursday.
	   A bomb exploded in an Algiers cafe Thursday morning, causing one
slight injury, French television station LCI reported.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government in the
former French colony scrapped second-round parliamentary elections
in January 1992.
	   The Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win the balloting on
voter discontent with corruption and high unemployment in this
petroleum-rich North African nation.

In year of nasty surprises, Hong Kong holds onto most freedoms With FEA-TOUGH YEAR-CHINA, FEA-TOUGH YEAR-VOICES

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Images of a rite of passage stick in the mind:
the majestic lowering of the Union Jack and the raising of a red
banner; a solemn Prince Charles and smiling Communist Party
officials, formally ending 150 years of colonialism.
	   The handover of Hong Kong last July 1 was a signal event of the
close of the 20th century and posed an open question for the 21st:
Can a community of free expression and wide-open markets survive
within a huge and restrictive communist society?
	   So far, the answer is a qualified yes.
	   Year One under Chinese rule has been full of nasty surprises.
But daily life has been affected less by Beijing than by a regional
economic contagion that began in Thailand. An influenza virus
provoked more worry than the People's Liberation Army.
	   Beijing's capacity for mischief now seems less of an issue than
the Hong Kong government's own democratic credentials, or the
territory's economic troubles.
	   What adversity there has been in Hong Kong has helped bring
subtle, yet potentially profound change. A ruling pro-Beijing elite
is under pressure to listen to its opponents and to seek support of
average people _ who are dispelling assumptions of political
apathy. For the first time in any corner of communist China, the
outline of a social contract may be emerging.
	   ``Hong Kong isn't a colony anymore, and the colonial 'good
enough' rates of consultation and participation are not 'good
enough' anymore,'' Michael DeGolyer, a political analyst charting
Hong Kong's transition, said in a report.
	   Nearly everyone agreed that Beijing largely has kept hands off.
	   Some labor laws were repealed, and some restrictions were placed
on demonstrations _ although none have been banned. China's Xinhua
news agency, thought to be the secret locus of the Communist Party,
was exempted from the territory's laws.
	   Yet on May 24 a record 53 percent of registered voters turned
out for legislative elections. A majority backed candidates seeking
more democracy.
	   On June 4, just as they have since 1989, tens of thousands of
people turned out to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre. The
Chinese Foreign Ministry said the demonstration was none of
Beijing's business.
	   Economically, Hong Kong has followed much of Asia into
recession. Unemployment is at a 15-year high, and the stock
market's key index is down 50 percent.
	   ``The government seems to want to do a lot, but it hasn't been
able to deliver,'' said Chan Ka-yan, a 25-year-old technician.
``They're changing their policies all the time.''
	   Politically, Hong Kong never has been a democracy _ either under
British or Chinese rule. Critics say that suits the temperament of
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and his team.
	   ``Instead of saying, 'Do we have to restrict freedom; is it
necessary to restrict freedom under these circumstances?', they
ask, 'Can we justify restriction of freedom?''' said Margaret Ng,
who will represent lawyers in the new legislature.
	   But Sonny Lo, an analyst at Hong Kong University, said Tung
actually protects Hong Kong because he ``understands the bottom
line of Beijing.''
	   Tung has run into his biggest troubles on home affairs, and it
is here that Hong Kong may develop the give-and-take of a mature
political system.
	   Tung was widely criticized for letting subordinates deal with
the ``bird flu,'' a virus that doctors feared could migrate from
poultry and kill people. Eventually, they decided to kill off all
the territory's chickens.
	   As the economy wilted, frequent small protests demanded action.
One common, if disputed, interpretation is that the record
electoral turnout was a huge vote of no-confidence. A recent poll
indicated Tung was less popular than the last British governor.
	   Officials now appear more concerned about public opinion. Two
economic packages quickly followed news that Hong Kong was headed
for recession. They include spending aimed at helping new home
buyers and small- and medium-size businesses.
	   DeGolyer derided the assumption that Hong Kong was politically
passive. Its people never had a way to influence the system under
the British, he said.
	   Now they may have one. After the elections, the traditional
pro-Beijing, pro-business faction that has run Hong Kong may
sometimes split. Grassroots pro-China politicians may cooperate
with government critics to demand more social spending. If they do,
they will come very close to a legislative majority.
	   The government also will face persistent demands from directly
elected legislators to speed up the transition to direct elections
for all 60 seats.
	   The road ahead could be perilous. China is beginning a tortuous
economic transformation that could lead to widespread unrest.
Martin Lee, Hong Kong's de facto opposition leader, said the lesson
of Tiananmen is that when the Beijing power elite feels threatened,
it cracks down _ regardless of consequences.
	   DeGolyer said local business interests must decide whether to
hang onto positions and influence, or try to build a mainstream
party and earn their influence in elections.
	   Asia has several examples of what happens when unelected and
unaccountable officials frustrate the will of the majority, he
said. One is stagnant Japan, where bureaucracy dominates. The other
is Indonesia, where social unrest just toppled a long-ruling
president.

Mexican official lowers heat in dispute with U.S. 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green has
adopted a more conciliatory tone in the dispute over a U.S. money
laundering sting that she says violated Mexican sovereignty.
	   But her department also said it had formally protested a U.S.
decision not to prosecute sheriff's deputies accused of clubbing
two Mexican citizens in California in 1966.
	   Green said Thursday that Mexico's pledge to ask for the
extradition of U.S. agents involved in the sting remains
hypothetical, until prosecutors find evidence of wrongdoing.
	   ``Until they (Mexican prosecutors) complete their
investigations, we're talking about hypothetical cases,'' Green
said following an address to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in
Mexico.
	   While calling for a review of anti-drug cooperation agreements
to ensure ``such an operation cannot happen again,'' Green said
``our most important challenge now is to recover confidence'' in
U.S.-Mexico relations.
	   ``The enemy, our common enemy, is the drug trafficker,'' she
said.
	   Mexicans were angered earlier by a non-binding U.S.
congressional resolution opposing the extradition of any agents
involved in the sting that led to 167 arrests, including several
Mexican bankers lured to the United States.
	   U.S. officials have seized dlrs 96 million.
	   Mexico says the U.S. agents did not have, or request,
authorization to operate on Mexican soil.
	   The Foreign Secretariat said in a news release that Mexico's
Embassy in Washington had filed a protest with the U.S. government
over the California incident.
	   It expressed ``profound surprise'' that the U.S. Justice
Department had decided not to prosecute two Riverside County
Sheriff's deputies on charges of human rights violations stemming
from the videotaped beatings of the Mexicans.
	   One sheriff's deputy was fired after the April 1, 1996, freeway
chase and beating of immigrants Enrique Funes and Alicia Sotero. A
second deputy was suspended for a month.

China is watching Hong Kong from afar _ but never too far With FEA-Hong Kong-A Tough Year 
</HEADLINE>
By PRISCILLA CHEUNG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ They remain vivid here, the warnings from
Martin Lee, Hong Kong's de facto opposition leader, of imminent
threats to the territory's liberties once China took over.
	   But a year later, even a fierce critic of Beijing such as Lee
concedes that Hong Kong ``still enjoys most of the freedoms.''
	   Civil liberties are mostly intact. News media are vibrant, and
protests denouncing Chinese communist rule, long a contentious
issue, are legal. Even mainland-style corruption is in check.
	   Lee said he can't be blamed for sounding the alarm because
threats from Beijing were real. And, he added, the danger isn't
entirely over.
	   Most people never expected blatant intervention, which could
kill a goose that was laying golden eggs and tarnish China's image
at a time when it badly needed foreign partners for its market
reforms. Subtle intervention through powerful pro-China business
and political elites, and post-handover Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa, seemed more likely.
	   On that, the verdict is divided. Lee thinks that when it
matters, Beijing finds ways to tell Tung what it wants. Others find
such fears largely unsubstantiated.
	   Several high-profile pieces of legislation and a decision not to
prosecute a media tycoon friendly to Beijing for fraud have sparked
speculation of behind-the-scenes control.
	   But analyst Lau Siu-kai, a member of a Beijing-appointed
committee that laid the groundwork for the handover, said they
merely showed Hong Kong's ``one-sided wish to please Beijing.''
	   The benefits were too insignificant for Beijing to pay the
political price, Lau said.
	   As Hong Kong struggles for shelter from the region's financial
turmoil, China's influence will grow, Lau said.
	   China is allowing more citizens to visit Hong Kong to boost
tourism. It will be the major stabilizing force for local and
foreign investors should Hong Kong's economy fall deeper, he said.
	   Lee warns that the harmony may not last because China swings
like a pendulum between clamping down and easing up. For now,
things are good.
	   ``When it swings violently to the left, it sweeps everything
with it,'' Lee said. ``The test will come when the pendulum swings
to the left.''

	   ___
	   ``Hong Kong is going backwards. The econony is getting worse,
and unemployment rate is high ... I really didn't want the British
to leave, and I was really sad to see (Gov. Chris) Patten go.
	   ``My mother and grandmother fled to Hong Kong to escape

	   _Vicky Lam, 36-year-old clerk.

autonomy than, say, Connecticut.''

	   ``In the run-up to the handover, people talked about only one of
two options. One, that Hong Kong business would be hurt by the
political transition, and two, that there would be no change. Both
were wrong. In fact, the link with China has had a stabilizing
effect, which no one expected at all.''

	   CADIZ, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police seized 12 tons of Moroccan
hashish from a yacht in waters off the Mediterranean coast,
arresting three Dutch and one British national.
	   Police said the drug was valued at more than 10 billion pesetas
(dlrs 64 million), the state news agency EFE reported. It also said
the hashish was destined for northern Europe.
	   The arrested were believed to be part of a international drug
gang and wanted by the Interpol police.
	   Police did not release the names of those arrested and declined
to give further details, saying the investigation was continuing.
	   The Spanish coastline is one of Europe's main gateways for
hashish from northern Morocco. The drug is usually smuggled onto
remote beaches in speedboats.

announced an increase in land supply, and then announced a freeze
over land supply.''
	   _Vicky Lam, 36-year-old clerk.
	   ___
	   ``Let's be fair. I hate to sound like an apologist for China ...
As a state to the central government, Hong Kong is given much more
autonomy than, say, Connecticut.''

	   ``This government doesn't have any foresight. The colonial
government used to have long-term vision, and they would see things
with an international perspective. When there's a problem, the

	   ``In the run-up to the handover, people talked about only one of
two options. One, that Hong Kong business would be hurt by the
political transition, and two, that there would be no change. Both
were wrong. In fact, the link with China has had a stabilizing
effect, which no one expected at all.''

Israeli officials express uncertainty over referendum 
</HEADLINE>
By DANNA HARMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the first time since floating the idea,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ministers in his government
have indicated that a referendum on an Israeli troop withdrawal
from the West Bank is not a sure thing.
	   Their comments Thursday came a day after U.S. officials hinted
that a national vote on an American proposal would be unwelcome if
it further delays the peace process.
	   Netanyahu has appointed a ministerial committee to research the
idea of a national vote and has said he felt public input over a
plan to cede West Bank land to the Palestinians was essential.
	   But Palestinians and several Israeli officials, including
President Ezer Weizman and members of Netanyahu's coalition, have
come out against the referendum idea, calling it a waste of time.
	   A referendum would delay an Israeli troop pullback by at least
two more months.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat, who is chairing the
referendum committee, said Thursday that the chances were
``fifty-fifty'' that a vote would be carried out.
	   Such a referendum would have to be approved by a majority in
parliament. Livnat acknowledged that the government cannot
guarantee a majority of Knesset support for the idea.
	   The United States has been urging Israel to approve a proposal
it submitted in January for turning over 13 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians, who already
have full or partial control over one-quarter of the West Bank,
have accepted the idea, but Netanyahu has yet to respond.
	   Earlier this week, Israel's justice minister recommended that a
non-binding polling take place after a government decision on the
withdrawal is made.
	   But Thursday Netanyahu said he was not closer to making a formal
decision on the referendum.
	   ``When we come up with an agreement, if we come up with an
agreement, then the government will have to decide both about the
agreement and about the matter of the referendum,'' Netanyahu said
in a speech at the Moshe Dayan Forum for Social Policy Studies in
Tel Aviv.

Readying to start executions, Trinidad reads death warrant to killer 
</HEADLINE>
By TONY FRASER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Moving a step closer to starting
up controversial executions, a government official read the death
warrant to 24-year-old Darrin Thomas.
	   Prison authorities and other government officials would not give
a day for the hanging, but traditionally they take place about two
working days after the warrant has been read.
	   The last hanging in this Caribbean country was in 1994.
	   On Tuesday, Attorney General Ralph Maharaj said Trinidad and
Tobago will ignore an international court order and proceed to hang
five convicted murderers.
	   Thomas was not among the five named by the Inter-American Court
on Human Rights in a ruling ordering the Caribbean government to
stay the executions of the men whose petitions were pending before
its Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
	   Thomas also was awaiting the hearing of a petition for clemency
before the commission, part of the Organization of American States.
	   But Maharaj said that his petition had overstayed an eight-month
period that the government gives the commission to respond.
	   Thomas was found guilty along with his common-law wife Maria de
Leon of killing a taxi driver in 1995. She remains on death row,
but has not had the death warrant read to her, prison officials
said.
	   Late Thursday, human rights attorneys were preparing a petition
to try to stop the execution.

	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton is nominating
career diplomat Richard Hecklinger to become ambassador to
Thailand, presidential aides said Thursday.
	   Hecklinger has been a member of the Foreign Service since 1967
and is currently a senior adviser to the undersecretary for
economic, business and agricultural affairs.
	   Hecklinger worked in the Office of Soviet Union Affairs and as
vice consul in Stuttgart, Germany. He went on to a number of
assignments dealing with international economic policy issues,
including the economic counselor at the U.S. Embassy in The Hague,
Netherlands.

Thriving bacteria colonies found in frozen polar lake AP Science Writer 
</HEADLINE>

By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a discovery that suggests life is possible
on Mars or on a frozen moon of Jupiter, researchers say they have
found colonies of bacteria thriving inside blocks of solid ice in
lakes near the South Pole.
	   A team of researchers drilling through the perpetual ice filling
shallow lakes in Antarctica, found teeming communities of microbes
living and thriving in temperatures that seldom rose above the
freezing point of water.
	   ``This is more proof that life is a lot more hardy than we once
thought,'' said Brian D. Lanoli of Oregon State University in
Corvallis, co-author of study being published Friday in the journal
Science.
	   If microbes can thrive in such frigid, hostile surroundings as
the Antarctic lakes, he said, then it could perhaps also be found
in the frozen seas of Europa, a moon of Jupiter, or the ice caps of
Mars.
	   ``Since we know there is ice elsewhere in our solar system, this
discovery makes us wonder if life might not exist there also,''
said Stephen J. Giovannoi, another co-author from Oregon State.
	   The researchers found the microbial colonies while drilling ice
cores from six lakes in Antarctica. As they drilled, they
discovered a layer of dust and grit down six to eight feet (two to
two and a half meters) below the surface of the always-frozen
lakes.
	   Giovannoi said the grains of soil set up a ``special set of
circumstances'' that made it possible for the microbes to live.
	   He said the dust was blown onto the ice during the Antarctic
summer during a time when the sun is always shining. The grains
absorbed solar heat and slowly sank into the ice. They reached a
point, about six to eight feet (two to two and a half meters) down,
and stopped sinking. A pocket of water formed around them and it
was here that the microbes set up their community.
	   The lakes are located in what is, in effect, a desert. The air
is very dry and precipitation is very low. Ice on the surface of
the ponds actually is eroded away continually. Water pockets
remain, however, at the same relative position, and eight to 10
feet (two and a half to three meters) above the bottom of the
lakes.
	   The lively time for the microbes lasts only while the sun
shines. Some of the organisms make food through photosynthesis from
the weak polar sun. But more than half of the year is spent in
twilight or total darkness of the extreme Antarctic seasons.
	   ``Their temperature, even when they are active, is about zero
degrees Centigrade (32 degrees F),'' said Giovannoi. This is just
at the freezing point of water.
	   In the winter, however, he said, the temperatures in the ice
drops to minus 20 F (minus 28.89 Celsius) or colder.
	   ``They (the microbes) are frozen in most of the year,'' said
Giovannoi. And, yet, he said, they have adapted to the extreme
conditions and are thriving.
	   ``What at first glance appears to be a contradiction in terms
(being frozen and leading an active life at the same time) turns
out to be an exciting example of the adaptation of microorganisms
to environmental extremes,'' the authors write in Science.
	   The physics that set up the conditions to enable the microbes to
live suggests that such environments could exist on Mars, which may
have frozen polar caps, or on Europa, a Jovian moon known to be
covered with frozen water, the researchers said.
	   It may be possible that soil or sand grains embedded in ice can
absorb enough solar energy to thaw the ice and create watery
pockets where microbes could survive, said Giovannoi.
	   This creates a whole new niche for microbial communities to
thrive in, he said.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke refuses
to reveal much about his talks with Yugoslav President Slodoban
Milosevic, but he continues to publicly push for troop withdrawals
from the troubled province of Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke, trying to head off NATO intervention, has met with
Milosevic twice this week in an attempt to negotiate an end to the
ethnic violence in the province.
	   In the second meeting, on Thursday, the two men met for several
hours in the presidential palace. Neither side comment on their
talks afterward.
	   But Holbrooke did say the West was urging ``that security
forces, the armed forces on both sides, should dismantle the
checkpoints and withdraw to ... barracks.''
	   Christopher Hill, U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, clarified the
request, saying only ``special police who have been engaged in some
of the operation need to be pulled back.''
	   ``It's not a request that all police in Kosovo need to be pulled
back nor it is a request that Yugoslavia not exercise its right to
control its borders,'' Hill said reporters.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting this year between
Serb-led security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
attracted increasing support in the predominantly Albanian province
of Serbia.
	   Holbrooke has taken on a diplomacy mission many see as a
last-ditch attempt to stop the conflict before NATO intervenes. On
Wednesday, he met with Milosevic, then traveled into the heart of
the battle zone and met with ethnic Albanian militants.
	   On Friday, Holbrooke was scheduled to meet with Ibrahim Rugova,
the ethnic Albanian leader, in the separatist province's capital of
Pristina.
	   In the latest fighting, the Serbs' Media Center said Thursday
that a Yugoslav army patrol clashed with a group of militants
trying to cross into Yugoslavia from Albania. Two Albanian citizens
were killed and six others captured. Large quantities of weapons
were seized.

	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Less than a year ago, France launched
major changes in its Africa policies away from involvement in her
former West African colonies.
	   Now, French President Jacques Chirac is on a six-day tour of
southern African countries, trying to encourage new relationships
that will bring closer political and economic ties.
	   On Friday, he travels to South Africa, the dominant nation of
the region that since 1994's first all-race elections has become
the anchor for new investment and economic growth in the formerly
war-torn region.
	   On Thursday, Chirac denied that France wants to counterbalance
increasing U.S. influence in Africa.
	   ``Contrary to the polemics I'm hearing, there is no competition
between the United States and and France in Africa. That is
completely absurd,'' he said while visiting Namibia.
	   Like U.S. President Bill Clinton when he visited Africa earlier
this year, Chirac is traveling with top business people to explore
investment and trade opportunities.
	   Chirac said France continues to offer official development
assistance to countries that need it, while the United States
places more focus on trade and investment
	   Chirac and Namibian president Sam Nujoma signed agreements on
health care assistance, a 35 million French francs (dlrs 6 million)
loan to Nampower, the power utility, and transportation
development.
	   The trip marks the first time a French President is visiting
Namibia, Mozambique and Angola.
	   The late President Francois Mitterrand visited South Africa soon
after Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994.

	   DENVER (AP) _ Kurt Abbott doubled off the wall in left-center,
scoring Vinny Castilla with the winning run in the 12th inning as
the Colorado Rockies beat Houston 6-5 on Thursday to sweep a
two-game series.
	   Abbott, a defensive replacement in the ninth who was 0-for-14
since his trade from Oakland on June 9, broke through with his
clutch hit off Mike Magnante (3-2). Curtis Leskanic (4-3) pitched
two innings for the victory.
	   Houston tied it at 5 in the ninth on Derek Bell's two-run homer.
Craig Biggio also homered for Houston, and John Vander Wal
connected for Colorado.
 &UR; Athletics 5, Giants 2
	   In San Francisco, Rickey Henderson hit a two-run single with the
bases loaded in the fourth inning and the Oakland Athletics took
advantage of Shawn Estes' wildness to beat the Giants.
	   It was the A's second straight win at 3Com Park against their
cross-bay NL rivals. The A's won 7-6 on Wednesday night after the
Giants took the first two games of the series at Oakland Coliseum.
	   Jimmy Haynes (6-3) won his second straight start, allowing one
run on five hits in six innings. Bill Taylor got the final four
outs for his 15th save. Estes dropped to 6-6.
 &UR; Brewers 9, Twins 2
	   In Minneapolis, Cal Eldred allowed two runs in 7 1-3 innings,
and got all the support he needed in a three-run first as Milwaukee
beat Minnesota.
	   Eldred (3-5) gave up five hits and struck out six, winning his
first game since June 5. The Brewers scored three in the first with
the aid of three errors that sabotaged Minnesota starter Brad Radke
(8-6).
	   Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz hit a two-run homer in the ninth, his
18th of the season.
 &UR; Padres 6, Mariners 0 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Tony Gwynn drove in two runs and Mark Langston
pitched 6 1-3 strong innings for his first victory since April 3 as
San Diego beat Seattle to end a two-game losing streak.
	   Langston (2-1), who pitched for the Mariners from 1984 until May
25, 1989, allowed four hits in 6 1-3 innings, matching his longest
outing this season. Ken Cloude (3-7) lost his sixth straight
decision.

they represent not China at its best, not China looking forward,

	   Clinton's comments to reporters in a nearby village came amid
reports that several dissidents had been detained by Chinese
authorities even as the president arrived. Clinton called the
reports ``disturbing'' and asked U.S. Ambassador James Sasser to
raise the issue with Chinese authorities.
	   Answering critics who argue his trip to China rewards an
oppressive communist government, Clinton said the plight of
dissidents ``makes it all the more important that we continue to
work with the Chinese and to engage them.''
	   The president also said the United States would not alter its
policy toward Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade island. The
United States holds to a one-China policy.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stocks slip in morning trading 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with dollar, stock and bond prices; ADDS trader
comment in 6th graf
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar jumped against the yen Friday morning as
Japanese investors bought the U.S. currency in the absence of any
signs of intervention. Tokyo stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 142.55 yen, up 1.63 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of 142.30 yen
overnight.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 94.31 points, or 0.62 percent, to 15,037.91 at the close of
morning trading. On Thursday, the Nikkei average edged up 9.04
points, or 0.06 percent.
	   Traders said Japanese institutional investors bought dollars to
seek better returns for their funds in booming U.S. financial
markets.
	   With no sign that U.S. and Japanese central banks will repeat
the dramatic intervention last week that boosted the yen, traders
said the economic fundamentals of a weak Japanese economy and
robust United States mean demand for dollars will continue.
	   ``Demand and supply is pointing overwhelmingly to
dollar-buying,'' said Minoru Shioiri, assistant foreign exchange
manager at Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
	   The dollar has now recouped nearly all its losses since June 17,
the day Japanese and U.S. financial authorities bought yen to halt
the Japanese currency's slide to eight-year lows.
	   On the stock market, share prices moved lower amid concern about
the country's ailing banking system.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 4.33 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,181.20. The
TOPIX closed up 4.60 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before.
	   With the government moving to set up a ``bridge bank'' to take
over loans from failed lenders, traders are starting to take
seriously comments by lawmakers that Japan will let weaker banks
fold.
	   That prompted selling of shares of many Japanese banks, who
still carry an estimated 76 trillion yen (dlrs 535 billion) in bad
loans on their books from the collapse of the country's speculative
real estate bubble in the early 1990s.
	   Particularly hard hit in recent days have been shares of the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., which fell Thursday to 50 yen
each _ a mere 2 percent of their value at the bubble's zenith ten
years ago.
	   Friday, its shares rebounded slightly, gaining 4 yen to 62 yen
at the close of the morning session.
	   LTCB says it has 1.4 trillion yen (dlrs 10 billion) in problem
loans. That's enough for many to question if the bank can remain
open without government support.
	   On Thursday, LTCB executives spelled out a drastic restructuring
plan and hinted at a possible merger at the bank's annual
shareholders' meeting.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.275 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.220 percent,
driving its price down to 111.40 yen from 111.81 yen.

Clinton says reports of dissident arrests are ``disturbing'' AP White House Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Combines pvs, trims
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
	   XI'AN, China (AP) _ After gently lecturing China on human
rights, President Clinton said Friday he was disturbed by reports
of a new government crackdown on dissidents. ``If true, they
represent not China at its best, not China looking forward, but
looking backward,'' he said.
	   Clinton said one of the objectives of his nine-day trip to China
was to discuss, publicly and privately, issues of personal freedom.
	   Clinton's comments came amid reports that several dissidents had
been detained by Chinese authorities even as the president arrived.
Talking to reporters, Clinton said he had asked U.S. Ambassador
James Sasser to raise the issue with Chinese authorities.
	   In the weeks leading up to Clinton's visit, dozens of dissidents
signed various appeals and petitions _ sent to foreign news
agencies _ urging the U.S. president to speak out on behalf of
freedom and the release of political prisoners and to make time to
meet with dissidents during his stay in China. Three dissidents
were detained Thursday by Chinese police.
	   Answering critics who argue his trip to China rewards an
oppressive communist government, Clinton said the plight of
dissidents ``makes it all the more important that we continue to
work with the Chinese and to engage them.''
	   The president also said the United States would not alter its
policy toward Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade island. The
United States holds to a one-China policy.
	   ``It's obvious there will be no change in our position one way
or the other on this trip,'' the president said in a remark sure to
disappoint Taiwan but please China.
	   On the first full day of his visit, Clinton journeyed to the
outskirts of this ancient capital to Xiahe, a village of 400 people
where the per capita income is about dlrs 400 a year. Villagers
told the president that their lives were improving under a kind of
grassroots capitalism system.
	   ``It's very impressive how much economic progress has been made
in such a short period of time,'' Clinton told villagers. One of
them told the president, ``We have a good policy in our country
now'' and that people have the freedom to do what they are good at.
	   Arriving from Washington, Clinton was welcomed Thursday night in
the grand style of ancient emperors. He was treated to an
extravagant celebration of costumed warriors and dancers who
cavorted to thunderous drums among a blaze of red lanterns. The
welcome was based on Tang Dynasty traditions dating to the 7th
century.
	   ``A new day is dawning for the Chinese people, for China's
greatness lies, as always, with its people,'' the president said.
	   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' Clinton said. ``In this global information age ... a
commitment to providing all human beings the opportunity to develop
their full potential is vital to the strength and success of the
new China, as well.''
	   The first presidential visit since the 1989 Tiananmen Square
crackdown, Clinton's trip is intended to help stabilize
U.S.-Chinese relations after years of grudging distrust. With
little expectation of any breakthroughs, officials said the
symbolism of Clinton's trip likely will outweigh the substance.

Philippine Airlines pilots say they will return to work

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of striking pilots at flag
carrier Philippine Airlines said Friday they will return to work
immediately, ending a devastating three-week strike.
	   It was not clear, however, whether the airline would accept them
back. PAL earlier dismissed the striking pilots and announced a
drastic reduction of operations to cope with financial problems
worsened by the strike.
	   Under the reduced operations the airline says it needs only 200
pilots instead of the more than 600 it had before.
	   The pilots' union said it will file a claim of illegal lockout
with the labor department if PAL refuses to accept the pilots back.
	   The union said its legal counsel had finally received late
Thursday a return-to-work order issued more than two weeks earlier
by the labor department. The order gives the striking pilots 24
hours to comply.
	   Under the law, a back-to-work order can only take legal effect
when it is served to the union's legal counsel, who had repeatedly
foiled the labor department's attempts to deliver the document.
	   ``We are not giving up the fight, but we are going to go back to
the cockpit,'' said union president Sotico Lloren. ``Our demands
are still there, negotiations are continuing, but we will go back
to work.''
	   The 625-member union went on strike June 5 to protest an airline
plan to retire certain pilots who have reached 20 years of service
or flown 20,000 hours, regardless of age.
	   PAL had declared the striking pilots terminated for ignoring the
back-to-work order, although it had not been formally delivered.
	   PAL says the pilots' strike has worsened financial problems
caused by Asia's currency crisis and has pushed it to the brink of
closure because of more than 2 billion pesos (dlrs 50 million) in
lost revenue.
	   Last week, PAL laid off 5,000 of its more than 13,000 workers in
an effort to scale down its operations and stave off more losses,
causing the airline's flight attendants and ground personnel to
threaten to strike as well.
	   PAL said more personnel may be laid off under the rehabilitation
plan, which calls for a leaner work force, disposal of 40 out of 54
planes, suspension of more than two-thirds of its routes and sale
of some subsidiaries.

Xiahe villagers question the Clintons 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Clinton-China
<TEXT>
	   XIAHE, China (AP) _ Given the chance to question President Bill
Clinton and his wife, Hillary, villagers went straight to the
bottom line: What's your favorite Chinese dish?
	   In a roundtable discussion Friday with local teachers, students,
physicians and people who run small businesses, the president and
Mrs. Clinton did most of the questioning. Who decides which
students get education beyond the ninth grade? (By passing a
college entrance exam.) Why has the people's health gotten better?
(``They have more money and do less physical work.'')
	   Where do the elderly get money to pay for retirement homes?
(Some from the government, some from their old factories.)
	   It was Mrs. Clinton who prompted the Chinese to jump in with
their own queries. One person asked why the president of the United
States would bother to seek out ``ordinary Chinese'' for
discussion.
	   It is important for political leaders to ``understand how people
live at what we call the grassroots level,'' Clinton replied.
	   A restaurant owner asked the Clintons to drop by for a meal:
``If you don't have the chance this time, you're still welcome
after you finish your duty as president to come back. And, what are
your favorite Chinese dishes?''
	   Clinton chuckled. ``This is very nice. You know, most people in
my position wonder if anyone will want us to eat with them when
we're not in office anymore.''
	   He did not say what his favorite dishes were.

Chavez win sets up rematch with De La Hoya 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: Will be updated with main event
<TEXT>
	   LEDYARD, Connecticut (AP) _ Mexican Julio Cesar Chavez, a former
six-time world champion, stopped Ken Sigurani at 2:09 of the third
round in a non-title bout at the Foxwoods Resort Casino Thursday
night.
	   The fight was on the undercard of the Buster Douglas-Lou
Savarese fight for the heavyweight title of the fringe
International Boxing Association.
	   The victory by Chavez (101-2-2) sets up a September rematch with
WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya. De La Hoya stopped
Chavez in the fourth round in June 1996.
	   Promoter Bob Arum had guaranteed Chavez dlrs 250,000 if he won
by knockout. It was the first knockout for Chavez since he stopped
Joey Gamache in the eighth round on Oct. 12, 1996.
	   The only thing that might prevent a rematch is the health of
Chavez. He suffered a serious cut near the right eye, which he
insisted was from a head butt. Chavez complained bitterly to
referee Arthur Mercante in the second round as blood ran down his
face.
	   Sigurani of the United States won the first two rounds on the
cards of all three judges. Chavez stunned Sigurani (22-2) with a
powerful right hand in the third, then unleashed a series of
combinations that forced Mercante to stop the fight.
	   Israel Cardona of the United States retained the USBA
lightweight championship by stopping fellow American Richard Kiley
at 1:16 of the eighth round. Cardona (29-2) dropped Kiley (11-2-3)
in the fifth, sixth and seventh rounds before putting him away in
the eighth.

Chilean government suspends plane purchases, makes other cuts 
</HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO DE CHILE, (AP) _ The government has suspended the
planned purchase of up to 16 new warplanes and announced a dlrs 685
cut in public spending in response to the Asian financial crisis.
	   Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat announced the measure Thursday
night. Central Bank President Carlos Massad, who attended the
announcement, backed the measures.
	   The Chilean Air Force was about to finalize a lengthy selection
process for the purchase of dlrs 600 million worth of planes from
either the United States, France or Sweden.
	   Last month, French Defense Minister Alain Richard and U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen promoted their countries' planes in
personal visits to Santiago.
	   But because of the financial problems gripping Asia and
affecting South America, local media had anticipated the possible
postponement of the deal until the second half of this year or
next.
	   Aninat said that despite the crisis, Chile had sufficient
international reserves to cover imports for the next 11 months.
	   Chile's principal commercial partners are Japan and other Asian
nations. Lower returns on copper, fish meal and cellulose were
expected this year.
	   The cuts amount to dlrs 200 million for the second half of the
year, which added to previous cutbacks, reaches dlrs 685 million.
	   They will hit all parts of Chilean society, Aninat said, though
he stressed that social programs won't be affected.
	   In other measures, Massad said the Central Bank decided to lower
from 30 to 10 percent the minimum amount of foreign reserves in the
Central Bank.
	   He added that the Central Bank will not allow a rise in exchange
rate and would maintain a 4.5 percent inflation rate for the year.
	   Bidding for the Chilean Air Force contract were two American
manufacturers: Lockheed Martin, with the F-16 and Boeing with the
F-18. Two European models were also being considered: the Mirage
2000-5 by Dassault Aviation of France and the Jas 39 Gripen, made
by Saab of Sweden.

Family of fugitive kidnap gang leader sent to Mexican prison 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ALMOLOYA, Mexico (AP) _ Three adult family members of Mexico's
most-wanted kidnapper made their first appearance before a judge at
the country's top-security prison on Thursday, charged with
organized crime, handling illicit funds and illegal weapons
possession.
	   The kidnap ring headed by fugitive Daniel Arizmendi allegedly
paid off policemen and cut gashes into the ears of its victims.
	   One former federal police officer and another alleged member of
the gang were named in the organized crime and illicit funds
charges and sent to the maximum-security Almoloya prison 35 miles
(56 kilometers) west of Mexico City on Wednesday.
	   Arizmendi's wife, Maria de Lourdes Arias, son and
daughter-in-law had been under house arrest since May 21, when a
police raid largely dismantled the kidnapping ring's headquarters
in the southern city of Cuernavaca. Arizmendi escaped the raid and
remains at large.
	   Witnesses have said that Daniel Arizmendi and his brother
Aurelio began kidnapping wealthy businessmen or their relatives in
1997 and used the money to buy buildings, houses and other
property.
	   Police so far have seized 60 properties allegedly owned by the
Arizmendis, who reportedly operated in Mexico City and the
surrounding states of Mexico and Morelos.
	   Witnesses also said he was protected by several police officials
in the area.
	   Television and press reports said Arias, a former nurse, was in
charge of cutting victim's ears to pressure relatives to pay
ransoms. She has denied that claim.
