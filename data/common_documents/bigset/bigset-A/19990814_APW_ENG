<HEADLINE> Garcia Knows About Woods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Even at the tender age of 19, Sergio Garcia  
understands a lot about the world of golf. 
</P>
<P>
	He also knows a lot about Tiger Woods and his chances of  
catching him in the final round of the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he plays like he played today, maybe we'll have to look for  
second place,'' Garcia said. ``It's nice to be following Tiger. The 
bad part is I know it's going to be very difficult to catch him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia and everyone else but Mike Weir found that out Saturday  
when Woods seized control of the season's final major on the front 
nine and only Weir decided to go along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Garcia played shabby -- he matched 4-under 68s with  
Woods -- but still found himself two strokes out of the lead going 
into the final day and out of the final pairing with Woods he had 
been hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia may not know the imposing statistic that Woods has won  
the last seven tournaments he has led after three rounds, but he 
does know the golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking about playing with Tiger. I was doing my best,  
but I couldn't catch him. It was impossible,'' Garcia said. ``It 
looked like I make a birdie and he goes behind me with another 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On an afternoon when the sun finally broke through to soak the  
fairways of Medinah Country Club, Garcia rebounded from a 
second-round 73 to put himself at 9 under and in a tie for third 
with Stewart Cink. 
</P>
<P>
	The two will play in the next-to-last twosome Sunday, just in  
front of Woods and Weir, the Canadian lefty with the quirky shot 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think that shooting 4 under I'd be that far from the  
lead,'' said Garcia, who admitted to keeping an eye on leaderboards 
scattered across the course to see how Woods was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a heady experience for the young Spanish phenom, who won  
the Irish Open on the European Tour after turning pro following the 
Masters but crashed at the British Open when he shot 89-83 and 
missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's a major, but I'm taking it as another  
tournament,'' said Garcia, who held the lead after a 66 in the 
opening round. ``But if I win it, it will be better than another 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cink and Garcia, who between them have only one PGA Tour win,  
both shot 68s, while second-round leader Jay Haas faded with a 75 
that put him in a group of four, five shots back at 6 under. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are two-time PGA champion Nick Price, who is 23 years  
older than Garcia but had much the same viewpoint about Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't very many courses that don't suit Tiger's game.  
But this one more than others because there's not much run on the 
ball,'' Price said. ``That makes it tough for the rest of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price's 69 was his third consecutive sub-par round, giving him  
some hope that he might be able to regain the form that saw him win 
this tournament in 1992 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he conceded, five shots might be a bit much to make up  
against Woods, who made only two bogeys in his last two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he drives the ball well tomorrow, I think we're going to  
have a tough time catching him because he's obviously very 
focused,'' Price said. ``I think he's been complaining about how 
poorly he's putting or how he's not making as many putts as he'd 
like to. He'll be saying the same things in 24 years time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About the only player not conceding to Woods was Weir, who was  
leading the tournament for a brief while on the front nine Saturday 
before Woods birdied three consecutive holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir has some experience playing in the final group -- he had  
done it three times this year, including last month's Western Open 
in which he and Woods played together and Woods won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger is the best player in the world and I lost my tour card  
last year, so if you told me at the beginning of the year that I'd 
be in this situation, I'd say no way,'' Weir said. ``I'm definitely 
the underdog. So I don't have anything to lose tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE>  NBA's Elie Visits School in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Mario Elie felt proud when he  
returned to his parents' homeland and saw how a dedicated former 
political prisoner and soccer player was nurturing hope in 
disinherited slum kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Haitian, too. And I'm tired of hearing nothing but  
negative things about Haiti. But this is positive,'' said the 
35-year old Manhattan-born guard for the NBA champion San Antonio 
Spurs, who had been with the two-time champions Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie hadn't visited Haiti since he was 17. So when Bobby Duval,  
a soccer star who now helps underprivileged children, invited him 
to return, Elie jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval runs Haiti Athletic, a soccer school for poor kids that he  
has almost singlehandedly turned from a vacant lot four years ago 
into a soccer field and clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The asphalt of three basketball courts had just been poured, and  
Elie was there for the opening Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Located in suburban Drouillard, the field is near some of the  
poorest neighborhoods in this poorest country of the Western 
Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most are slum kids, and their models are juvenile  
delinquents,'' Duval said. ``But our kids won't turn into bums. 
They learn discipline and how to dream a brighter dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About half of Haiti's 8 million population is under 18.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of thousands of poor kids want to get involved in  
sports. I want to show them the way,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's professional soccer career ended brutally in 1976, when  
he was accused of political activism during the Jean-Claude ``Baby 
Doc'' Duvalier dictatorship. He was arrested and imprisoned in the 
Fort Dimanche fortress for 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
	After Duvalier's exile in 1986, Duval became a political  
activist and went on to work in his family's construction business. 
Now at age 45, he works full time at keeping the school alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends, private-sector sponsors and private voluntary  
organizations provide the school with funds and supplies, but it 
survives on a month-by-month basis. Sometimes Duval cannot meet the 
payroll for his 20 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Duval's supervision, eight trainers teach soccer skills to  
more than 200 slum kids from ages 7 to 20. Hundreds more flock to 
the field to watch. Many of Duval's kids are so poor they come to 
practice barefoot. 
</P>
<P>
	At Haiti Athletic everything is free -- soccer gear and the hot  
meal the players get after practice. Duval also pays their school 
fees and medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said there is hope that Haitians may someday rebuild the  
ruined sports infrastructure that, in 1974, pushed Haiti into the 
World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti has 24 first division A dilapidated sports stadium was  
recently renovated, and the government runs a soccer camp for 
promising young players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's hope for us. Haitians are doing things for Haitians,''  
Elie said.

<HEADLINE> Boston's Martinez Pitches in Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez, who arrived at Fenway Park late  
and was scratched from his start Saturday against Seattle, made his 
first relief appearance in more than five years and posted his 
major league leading 17th win in Boston's 13-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The ace entered in the sixth inning with the Red Sox leading  
7-1. Emergency starter Bryce Florie pitched 4 2-3 innings and Rheal 
Cormier got the last out in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was late and we had to make a decision to start another  
pitcher,'' Williams said. ``Normally our pitchers head out about a 
half-hour, 25 minutes before (the start). He was late. He got here 
after I made a choice to start another pitcher, period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the sellout crowd noticed Martinez was walking in, he was  
greeted by a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first relief appearance since June 1, 1994, when he  
was with Montreal. After retiring Ken Griffey Jr. on a fly ball, 
Alex Rodriguez hit a towering drive over the left-field screen for 
his 30th homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, who returned from the 15-day disabled list Aug. 3  
after being sidelined with a sore right shoulder, walked out to the 
bullpen approximately 25 minutes before the first pitch while 
Florie was playing long toss. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, who admitted after the game that he was upset about  
Williams' decision, took a seat at the end of the bullpen and 
didn't move when Florie warmed up from the bullpen mound. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, Martinez said he was late because he was getting  
ready for the start at home with his physical therapist. At first, 
he fully blamed himself, then he called his manager ``stubborn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing going on,'' Martinez said. ``I'm a lttle upset  
with myself, that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked why he was late, the All-Star right-hander became  
vocal about Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``How come I was late? I was doing something at home,'' Martinez  
said. ``I was doing some things for me and my team, and Jimy 
couldn't take it today. He was stubborn. I think we could have kept 
it in the clubhouse. I already talked to my teammates. I messed 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez said that the club has a rule that players show up two  
hours prior to the game's scheduled starting time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just didn't think Jimy would take it that way,'' he said.  
``I didn't know this two-hour rule before the game is so important 
for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he expected any future problems with his manager,  
Martinez said: ``It's going to be great. I'm not that type of guy. 
If I'm a bad influence on the team, then you better get rid of 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, the 1999 All-Star MVP, went 15-3 in the first half  
before coming up with a sore shoulder July 18. 
</P>
<P>
	In two starts since returning, he worked just 10 innings, giving  
up three runs and six hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was asked after Friday's game if Martinez would be on a  
pitch count Saturday. He ended up throwing 62 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our pitchers are on pitch counts. I think maybe we'll  
be a little more guarded,'' Williams said. ``He threw 100 the last 
time out. (Bret) Saberhagen threw 76 in his last start, but we had 
to get him out after eight (innings) because he was up and down a 
lot. It depends how (Martinez) feels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez's name was listed as the starting pitcher on the lineup  
sheet handed out by the club. At the end of the first inning, he 
walked back to the dugout without his jacket and glove, which he 
took to the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	After the second inning, he walked back to the bullpen. In  
between the third and fourth innings, he warmed up right fielder 
Butch Huskey before starting to loosen up in the bullpen after the 
Mariners were retired in the fifth.

<HEADLINE> ACLU May Sue Over Evolution Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union says  
school districts could face lawsuits if they attempt to teach 
creationism in wake of the state school board's recent decision to 
de-emphasize the teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU, in a letter Friday to school superintendents, warned  
the districts about adopting ``religiously-based standards'' in 
teaching science. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU also noted U.S. Supreme Court decisions that forbid the  
teaching of creationism, the belief that a higher power created the 
universe, because of its religious foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	People for the American Way and Americans United for the  
Separation of Church and States also said they would consider 
lawsuits if religion-based standards were implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	The board adopted new testing standards Wednesday that play down  
the scientific importance of evolution, particularly the theory 
that humans descended from apes and other lower species. 
</P>
<P>
	Local school districts will continue to decide what subjects are  
taught in their classrooms, but critics and supporters of the new 
standards think they could influence some districts' lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the new standards said the criticism was like  
running and yelling, ``The sky is falling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be frankly surprised if any district throws evolution  
out,'' said Linda Holloway, the chairwoman of the state board. 
``That is certainly not my intent. I have no problem with the 
teaching of evolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some, including Gov. Bill Graves, say the board's decision has  
embarrassed the state. Governor's spokesman Mike Matson said Graves 
received about 200 e-mails the day after the new standards were 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	A man from Minnesota wrote that he would ``add the state of  
Kansas to my list of places I will not visit because of the 
apparent declining intelligence of the population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graves also said the decision was ``so out of sync with  
reality'' that it minimized the board's credibility. Some lawmakers 
now are talking about abolishing the board or stripping it of 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an issue in the legislative session,''  
Graves, a moderate Republican, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators say the controversy over evolution could create  
support for changes that have been sought for years by lawmakers in 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably, the right wing did us a favor,'' said Senate  
President Dick Bond, also a moderate Republican. ``We ought to send 
them a thank-you note. Maybe we can get change now.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Teen Idol Garrett Goes for Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former teen idol Leif Garrett pleaded guilty  
to drug possession to get into a rehabilitation program that could 
wipe his criminal record clean. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett, 37, will serve no jail time if he successfully  
completes the program, and the conviction will be cleared from his 
record. He completed a similar program after a 1997 arrest for 
cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The former child actor and 1970s singing sensation was among  
several people arrested June 29 in a sting at an apartment. He 
entered his plea Thursday. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Oregon May Turn Nuke Plant to Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RAINIER, Ore. (AP) -- The ill-fated nuclear reactor that many  
locals believe inspired the oozing, green-glowing plant on ``The 
Simpsons'' is now inspiration for an offbeat plan: turning the 
reactor grounds into Oregon's newest state park. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years after it closed down, owners of the Trojan nuclear  
plant want families to roll their RVs onto the property and camp 
out in the shadow of a 500-foot cooling tower and a fortified tank 
of spent radioactive fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Some state officials reacted with Homer Simpson-like laughter.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'd never need electricity at night,'' joked state parks  
department spokesman Jim Lockwood, ``because the place glows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Portland General Electric, which is offering the land for  
free, sees the proposal as a way to emphasize ``responsible 
environmental stewardship'' and show that a decommissioned nuclear 
plant can be safe. Utility executive Fred Miller called the site 
``unthreatening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as parks go, it would indeed have a little bit of  
everything: nearly 500 acres of woods and wetlands, crystal-clear 
creeks and lakes, access to the Columbia River and 200 species of 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, skeptics wonder how eager campers would be to visit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'd want to be camping in the park,'' said  
longtime reactor opponent Lloyd Marbet, of the group Don't Waste 
Oregon. ``I wonder how many people would like to camp next to a 
repository for spent fuel with no place to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In defense of its safety claims, the utility has taken steps to  
protect the proposed park area from the vestiges of the largest 
commercial reactor ever taken off line in United States. Earlier 
this month, tugboats hauled the 1,000-ton nuclear reactor up the 
Columbia River to a burial site in the eastern Washington desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The 800 spent uranium fuel rod assemblies that have been removed  
from the reactor over the years are kept on a 134-acre site that 
PGE would retain. They are submerged in 40-foot deep, 
concrete-and-steel pools until they can be readied for transport to 
a yet-to-be-built federal dump site. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the area acknowledge feeling a bit leery about  
coming so close to a nuclear facility, closed or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of an eerie feeling here,'' Julie Etringer said,  
glancing up at the tower as she watched her husband and two 
children fish at a lake on the Trojan grounds already accessible to 
the public for day use. 
</P>
<P>
	David Vosper, a 9-year old who often fishes for rainbow trout in  
Trojan's lake, said he's heard whisperings about eight-legged frogs 
and three-armed turtles in the marshland. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the kind of images fostered on animated series ``The  
Simpsons,'' which depicts the nuclear plant where Homer works as an 
accident-prone place of leaking toxins, glowing goo and green 
steam. 
</P>
<P>
	Although ``Simpsons'' makers deny any connection to Trojan,  
people here have long believed the plant was the inspiration for 
the show because its creator, Matt Groening, grew up 40 miles to 
the south in Portland and has peppered his scripts with other local 
references.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Gets Receiver Robinson Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn receiver Clifton Robinson was  
welcomed back to the football team Saturday, one day after pleading 
guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clifton is back on the team,'' coach Tommy Tuberville said.  
``He and I will sit down today and I'll tell him that we do things 
right around here, so he can expect there will be some punishment. 
What it is, I don't know yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 21, was accused of having sex with a 15-year-old girl  
who was visiting her sister in Auburn in March. He avoided going to 
his scheduled Aug. 23 trial by pleading guilty Friday to the 
lesser, misdemeanor charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee County District Attorney Nick Abbott said Robinson, a junior  
from Naples, Fla., was given a one-year suspended sentence and 
ordered to perform 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	His guilty plea came on the same day Auburn's varsity players  
reported back to campus. Robinson had been suspended from the team 
since last March when the charges against him were filed. 
</P>
<P>
	He was expected to be back on the football field in time for  
Monday's workout, which made Tuberville happy. The Tigers are thin 
on receivers this season and Robinson was the returning leader in 
all-purpose yards with 943. He was also second on the team with 42 
catches for 672 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am overjoyed to see Clifton coming back to the football  
team,'' quarterback Gabe Gross said. ``We needed him back and it's 
good to see he could get his legal troubles straightened out and 
get back to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abbott said the plea agreement came at the request of the girl  
and her mother, who both wished to avoid a trial.

<HEADLINE> Library Compiles 20th Cent. Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like a century's-end time capsule, the Library  
of Congress is gathering examples of scenes, sights and events of 
everyday America as a testament to the country's uniqueness. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a world where Green Bay Packer fans bare their chests  
against Wisconsin's wicked winter wind. Marchers honor the lowly 
peanut in Alabama and sweet corn in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	These and similarly disparate events were suggested by members  
of Congress and representatives of U.S. territories, asked by the 
library to propose subjects for the collection. 
</P>
<P>
	James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, said the project  
``celebrates, and shares with the nation, the grass-roots 
creativity of every part of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tied to the Library of Congress' 200th birthday next year, the  
project, called ``Local Legacies,'' also will include a selection 
of poetry chosen with the help of more than 19,000 Americans and a 
video of President Clinton reading from a poem about the American 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The library's assembled material will join the 115 million  
books, films, software and other items in the world's largest 
collection of official records. 
</P>
<P>
	From Rep. Mark Green, R-Wis., whose district includes Green Bay,  
came the Packers idea. Green is a lifelong fan and a covered-chest 
season ticket holder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Towards the end of the season, in December and January, it  
gets down to 30 or 40 below zero, what with the wind-chill factor, 
and some of the fans have imbibed a lot of adult beverages,'' Green 
said. ``They take off their coats and shirts, their chests spell 
out the word `Packers' and get very red.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., offered three projects,  
including a celebration at Mendota, Ill., that honors sweet corn 
with a fair and parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala, suggested the National Peanut  
Festival, held annually for 56 years in Dothan, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	It celebrates a crop that fed Africans aboard slave ships coming  
to America but, thanks largely to George Washington Carver, who was 
born a slave, ranks with cotton among the South's leading crops. 
Carver developed more than 300 products, from flour to fertilizer, 
that can be produced from peanuts and sweet potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the poetry contributions, poet laureate Robert Pinsky  
will present the library with 50 videos of Americans reading their 
favorite poems. Readers include Clinton, who recites Ralph Waldo 
Emerson's ``Concord Hymn'' on the 50th anniversary of the first 
engagement in the American Revolution: 
</P>
<P>
	``Here once the embattled farmers stood  
</P>
<P>
	``And fired the shot heard round the world.''  
</P>
<P>
	Proposers must submit their local legacy projects by year's end,  
although Pinsky's will take much longer to complete. Over the past 
16 months he has collected favorite poems chosen by nonpoets from 
sixth-graders up. 
</P>
<P>
	``With close to 20,000 submissions from every state of the  
union, all ages and professions from circus acrobat to accountant, 
the evidence is there that many Americans love poetry,'' Pinsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He will pick 200 video and 1,000 audio recordings to be  
deposited in the library to join more than 2,000 others in the 
library's archives of recorded poetry and literature.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Vote at GOP Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- It was a Republican straw poll Saturday, but  
that didn't deter Democrat Joe Shannahan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful day to watch conservative Republicans,'' said  
Shannahan, a former spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party and a 
supporter of Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannahan said he planned to vote for the Republican candidate  
who would do the most damage to GOP front-runner George W. Bush, 
but that he didn't bring a large group with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't try to orchestrate anything,'' he said. ``That  
wouldn't be right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Parker, spokesman for Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack's last  
campaign, sported a Lamar Alexander button and headed for a polling 
place. ``Lamar's been my guy for a long time,'' he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they were serious about enforcing time limits  
on the presidential candidates, and they wasted no time 
demonstrating that resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Keyes was the first speaker, and he had the jammed coliseum  
rocking with his fiery oratory when he came to the time limit. GOP 
officials shut off the microphone, cutting off Keyes in 
mid-sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a smattering of boos from Keyes' backers and he stood  
frozen for a moment. His family quickly came on stage, and they all 
waved and walked off. 
</P>
<P>
	The party gave each of the nine candidates a total of 13 minutes  
to speak. Most planned a three-minute ``spontaneous'' 
demonstration, followed by a 10-minute speech. 
</P>
<P>
	State Republican officials have said they warned candidates in  
advance that the time limit would be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Not all those who came to Ames actually got inside the Hilton  
Coliseum to hear the candidate speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly three hours before voting ended, officials began  
refusing access to the facility, saying it was filled to legal 
capacity. With the seating arrangement selected by Republicans, the 
building holds just under 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There were thousands of people still milling outside at that  
time, with some entertainment still going on. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of bikers were among those attending the straw poll.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not supporting anybody,'' said Paul Orton, of Eldora,  
better known as ``Taco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orton drove in with the bike brigade headed by Colorado Sen. Ben  
Nighthorse Campbell, and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, as did Mark 
Maxwell, who had stronger opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very passionate people,'' said Maxwell. ``We get  
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell said he was voting for publisher Steve Forbes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	There were plenty of athletes in Ames, too, showcased by the  
candidates they supported. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reggie White, a recently retired pro football star, had his  
own mission. He wanted the presidential candidates to sign a pledge 
to stamp out pornography. ``I'm trying to promote godly things,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Green Bay Packer at one time was a big backer of Gary  
Bauer, but insisted he wasn't supporting any candidate right now. 
</P>
<P>
	Orrin Hatch brought in NBA star Karl Malone, of the Utah Jazz,  
while Texas Gov. George W. Bush brought in former pro football star 
Roger Staubach and popular former University of Iowa football Coach 
Hayden Fry. 
</P>
<P>
	Fry was the role model for the television series ``Hayden'' and  
is a transplanted Texan.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Hollings, Petty Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLE OF PALMS, S.C. (AP) -- Sen. Fritz Hollings and his wife had  
to flee as their home was destroyed in a fire that swept through 
their upscale beach community. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames also destroyed a vacation home belonging to race  
driver Kyle Petty. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	The fire started around sundown Friday in one beachfront house  
in the Wild Dunes community, spread to Petty's house and then 
crossed the street to Hollings' house. Two other houses also 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a firestorm in there,'' Fire Chief Ann Graham  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had not determined the cause Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hollings, D-S.C., and his wife, Peatsy, were home when the fire  
broke out but were able to escape safely, said Maury Lane, the 
senator's spokesman. They went to stay with friends in Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty, in Watkins Glen, N.Y., for a NASCAR race, said Saturday  
that his wife, Patty, called to tell him about the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a vacation home we owned for about seven or eight  
years, and it was pretty special to Patty and especially the kids 
because they kind of grew up there in the summers,''' Petty said.

<HEADLINE> Five Women Sue FedEx for Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Five women have filed a $17 million  
sexual harassment suit against Federal Express Corp. and a manager 
at a local office. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed Friday in Montgomery County Circuit Court alleges  
that Ronald Epps, 41, sexually assaulted or molested three of the 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth woman accused Epps of threatening her after she  
rejected his advances, while a fifth woman clamied supervisors did 
not follow up on complaints that she had been sexually assaulted 
and harassed by co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far our investigation has revealed that local management  
was aware of what was going on,'' Lawrence S. Lapidus, an attorney 
for the women, said Saturday. ``They allowed this type of 
environment to flourish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Epps has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Boyd, a spokeswoman for the Memphis-based company, said  
officials would not comment on the lawsuit because they had not 
seen it.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Food Scare Victims Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Belgian banks have agreed to provide  
cheap loans to companies and farmers that lost money during the 
recent scare over a cancer-causing chemical found in foods, the 
government said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks will lend $715 million over seven years, said Bob Van  
de Voorde, spokesman for Belgian government Commissioner Freddy 
Willockx. The banks and the government will subsidize the loans, 
cutting the interest rate to 2 percent below the regular rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The scare hit Belgium in May when the government announced that  
high levels of dioxin had been discovered in eggs, meat and dairy 
products. A wide range of products were pulled from store shelves, 
and several nations banned Belgian food. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the loan deal, borrowers won't pay interest in the  
first year and will start to repay only at the end of the third 
year, Van de Voorde said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government is expected to approve the agreement over  
the weekend. The European Union Commission then will have to decide 
whether the proposal is in line with EU competition rules.

<HEADLINE> GOP Congressman Touts Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans can find retirement security for  
themselves and their children in the GOP tax bill that emphasizes 
personal savings, a Republican congressman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year, $792 billion tax-cut package passed this month  
``will result in more pension coverage, better-funded pensions and 
more retirement security for millions of workers,'' Rep. Rob 
Portman of Ohio said in the GOP's weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has threatened to veto the bill because he  
contends it is so large it would bring back government deficits and 
its tax breaks would mainly benefit wealthier Americans. Instead, 
he has proposed using some of the surplus for Medicare and some for 
new government-subsidized retirement accounts for low- and 
middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	But Portman, a member of the House's tax-writing Ways and Means  
Committee and co-chairman of the House Republicans' Retirement 
Security Task Force, insisted the legislation would ``give millions 
of American workers the real peace of mind that comes with having 
your own personal retirement savings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the package would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow more tax-sheltered deposits into IRA, 401(k) and other  
pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make pensions portable, and let workers become vested in  
retirement plans in three years instead of five. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let people 50 or older make extra, ``catch-up'' contributions  
to pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you, and every working American, to be able to keep  
more of the money you earn so you can prepare a more secure future 
for yourself and your children,'' Portman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would be willing to negotiate tax cuts only  
after his other budget priorities have been addressed, beginning 
with Medicare's long-term solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill includes a one-percentage-point reduction in all  
income-tax rates, an easing of the tax paid by many married 
couples, a cut in the capital gains tax on profits from 
investments, elimination of the inheritance tax on large estates 
and various tax breaks for businesses.

	Pressure To Oust Milosevic Mounts  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- As pressure mounts from within  
Yugoslavia to oust President Slobodan Milosevic, vice premier 
Tomislav Nikolic -- an ultranationalist -- told a German magazine 
that Milosevic should resign ``not because the West demands it, but 
rather because he capitulated in Kosovo.'' On the other end of the 
political spectrum, Serbia's opposition leaders today warned 
Milosevic to resign or face an intense round of fall protests. Most 
Kosovo Serbs feel betrayed by Milosevic, who first provoked NATO's 
bombing campaign by refusing to agree to a Kosovo peace settlement, 
only to agree to terms he originally rejected after the bombing, 
effectively losing control of Kosovo.

	GOP Hopefuls Court Iowa Voters  
</P>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Courting Iowa voters today in an informal poll  
that could reshape the GOP field, George W. Bush sought to solidify 
his front-runner status, but publisher Steve Forbes mounted a 
significant challenge. In all, nine White House hopefuls poured 
millions of dollars and spent hundreds of hours to test the potency 
of their political operations. The straw poll -- a party fund-raiser 
that looks more like a state fair -- is a pay-to-vote staple of Iowa 
politics, though no straw poll winner ever has won the GOP 
nomination. Four hours before the voting concluded, Bush aides said 
they had purchased 10,500 ballots, while Forbes officials had 
purchased 7,711 tickets. One candidate, Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona, called the non-binding poll a ``sham'' and refused to go.

	Death Penalty Sought for Ala. Suspect  
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIANA, Ala. (AP) -- Defense attorneys for a man accused of  
fatally shooting three people at two offices he worked at said Alan 
Eugene Miller is ``at best, very slow'' and should be in a mental 
health facility instead of Alabama's electric chair. A Shelby 
County grand jury yesterday indicted Miller, 34, on one count of 
capital murder. Miller is accused of opening fire at Ferguson 
Enterprises and Post Airgas in Pelham on Aug. 5, killing Lee 
Holdbrooks, 32; Christopher Scott Yancy, 28; and Terry Jarvis, 39. 
Shelby County District Attorney Robby Owens said he would 
``absolutely'' seek the death penalty. He said Miller was indicted 
on one count because the three were slain in a single course of 
action. Arraignment is set for Aug. 17.

	Russians, Islamic Militants Clash  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces fought Islamic  
militants in scattered skirmishes in Dagestan today, suffering at 
least four deaths as officials admitted that the rebels remained in 
control of seven villages. The fighting was concentrated in the 
Caucasus region of Dagestan, a mountainous Russian republic that 
borders breakaway Chechnya. Russian troops backed by Dagestani 
volunteers have been trying to oust the militants since they seized 
several areas in Dagestan a week ago. Many of the militants belong 
to the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect and are seeking an independent 
Islamic republic in the mostly Muslim regions of the Caucasus 
Mountains.

<P>
	Report: Protesters Sentenced To Die  
</P>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary  
Court reportedly has condemned to death instigators of last month's 
mass protests, Iran's worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic 
revolution. The evening Kayhan daily, which is believed to have 
close ties to Iran's hard-line judiciary, quoted ``informed 
sources'' today, but the story has not been confirmed. The mass 
protests, which highlighted the struggle between reformists and 
conservatives in the government, were sparked by the police's 
storming of a Tehran University dormitory on July 9 after students 
objected to the banning of a reformist newspaper.

	Kellogg Closes Historic Mich. Plant  
</P>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co. today announced it would  
close most of its historic hometown plant and cut about 550 jobs in 
its latest effort to revive a sagging bottom line. ``Continuing to 
reduce costs and increase efficiencies is an important part of our 
global strategy to return Kellogg Company to strong, steady 
growth,'' said President and CEO Carlos M. Gutierrez. The decision 
is a heavy blow to this city where the scent of freshly baked 
cereal often permeates the air and generations of families have 
banked on work with the company.

	McGwire and Sosa Hit Home Runs  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire caught up with last year's home  
run record pace with No. 47 and Sammy Sosa hit his 44th today as 
the Chicago Cubs beat the St. Louis Cardinals 9-7. Last year, 
McGwire and Sosa homered on the same day 21 times as McGwire 
finished with a record 70 and Sosa also broke Roger Maris' 
37-year-old record with 66. McGwire's homer off Cubs rookie 
left-hander Micah Bowie tied Eddie Murray for 15th place on the 
career list at 504 and hiked his NL-leading RBI total to 110.

<P>
	Reaction to the death Saturday of Hall of Fame shortstop Pee Wee  
Reese: 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``(Gil) Hodges was a sharp thinker, (Roy) Campanella was a  
captain, Jackie (Robinson) was a captain, and Pee Wee was the 
captain of captains.'' -- Brooklyn pitcher Carl Erskine. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``He could look a guy with a half-snarl and burn his shorts off.  
He never shouted, and he played every day. He didn't have to say 
anything, he just showed everyone.'' -- Erskine. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Dodger dressing room in Brooklyn, you had the metallic  
lockers and they all had stools. But Pee Wee had an armchair, and 
he would sit there smoking his pipe. He was not the senior citizen, 
because that would make him sound like he was an old man. But you 
knew as soon as you walked into the clubhouse, there's the king. 
There's the captain. There's the No. 1 man.'' -- longtime Dodgers 
broadcaster Vin Scully. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I mentioned (on the air) that Pee Wee was pushing the  
wheelchair out, but naturally, the story and the spotlight was on 
Roy Campanella. And I remember vaguely saying something about how 
many times Roy Campanella had gone to the mound to console or 
advise or pep up a pitcher. And tonight, he's going to the mound 
with Pee Wee pushing the chair.'' -- Scully, recalling a tribute the 
Dodgers held for paralyzed catcher Roy Campanella at the Los 
Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those things when Pee Wee played against the  
Yankees, he could never beat them. That groundball to Pee Wee was 
the last out to beat them.'' -- Johnny Podres, who shut out New York 
2-0 in Game 7 of the 1955 World Series to bring Brooklyn its only 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Pee Wee would say, `We're all on this team, we're here to win  
a championship and we're all a part of the Dodgers. All these other 
feelings, you can take 'em and flush 'em down the toilet. We're 
going to play baseball.''' -- pitcher Don Newcombe, a Brooklyn 
teammate.

	``There was a classic picture of him with his arm around Jackie.  
And Pee Wee always said, `I wasn't there just because I wanted to 
put my arm around Jackie. I was there because I was tired and I 
wanted to lean on my second baseman. It looked to people like I had 
my arm around him just because I wanted to let people think that I 
cared about him. Sure, I cared about him. I cared about everybody 
on the team. But I was tired that day.''' -- Newcombe.

always a gentleman and a class act. I guess I probably knocked him 
down at second base trying to break up double plays dozens of 
times, and he never said anything because he knew it was only part 
of the game.'' -- Hall of Fame outfielder Enos Slaughter.

<HEADLINE> Rockies Recall Pitcher Thomson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rockies recalled right-hander John  
Thomson from Triple-A Colorado Springs on Saturday and placed 
struggling reliever Mike DeJean on the 15-day disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomson, who opened the season with the Rockies, will start the  
first game of a split doubleheader Sunday against the Montreal 
Expos. He was 0-5 with an 11.84 ERA in six starts before being 
demoted to the minors in May. 
</P>
<P>
	A recurring blister on his pitching hand limited Thomson to five  
starts at Colorado Springs. He was 0-2 with a 9.45 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	DeJean was placed on the DL with tendinitis in his right elbow.  
The right-hander gave up six runs in one inning Friday against 
Montreal. He also didn't retire any of the three hitters he faced 
in his previous appearance.

<HEADLINE> Tiger a Contender in Golf's Majors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Tiger Woods has become a man for all  
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost won the U.S. Open. He could have won the British Open.  
And the way he has played the first two rounds at Medinah Country 
Club, he might win the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only place Woods no longer seems to be a factor on  
Sunday is Augusta National, where his 1997 victory was so dominant 
he will be a favorite every time he drives down Magnolia Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``My game has improved so much,'' Woods said. ``Every shot in my  
bag has gotten better, and that's just because of maturity and more 
experience and a lot more practice. And hopefully, down the road I 
can say I'm a better player than I am now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Better now than he was two years ago?  
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the Western Open in 1997 was his sixth on the PGA  
Tour, including the Masters. Since then, he has won four times in 
America and still hasn't bagged another major. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just watch me,'' Woods often says, an invitation to see the  
difference in his game, obvious in the consistency more than the 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He used to be a classic case of feast or famine. Sure, he won  
the Masters by a record 12 strokes, but he often found himself 12 
strokes out of the lead in a major come Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's no longer the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Even in the Masters, where he tied for 18th, he was only five  
strokes behind going into the final round. Woods has failed to 
finish outside the top 20 only two times in 16 tournaments this 
year. Since returning from his post-Masters break, Woods has won 
three times and finished no worse than seventh in the other three 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	All he needs now is another major. All Woods keeps doing is  
giving himself a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always disappointed when I don't win a major,'' he said.  
``I was disappointed last year. But realistically, you're not going 
to win one every year. The greatest players have never done that. 
All you can ask is to give yourself opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are only four a year,'' he said. ``If you can somehow  
have a chance to win on the back nine Sunday on each and every one, 
I figure for the rest of my life I would have a few of them in my 
pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is not indifferent about the majors. Just the opposite.  
While his game is more complete, allowing him to choose between 
power or control, his passion has never been stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I putting less pressure on myself? No, same amount,'' he  
said. ``It's just I'm a better player. I'm hitting the shots 
better. I'm a better driver of the golf ball. My whole game is 
better. And because of that, it tends to make you outwardly a 
little bit more at ease. 
</P>
<P>
	``But inside,'' he said, ``it's a different story.''  
</P>
<P>
	It is a different story outside as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods has added savvy to his skill. He has gone through an  
overhaul of his swing plane, giving him a better chance of 
controlling the ball flight and the distance. He constantly works 
on his short game. He hits driver when it makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say Woods has become more cautious. Woods only says he has  
gotten better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always had a good game plan,'' he said. ``I just could  
never really execute them. If you can't execute your game plan, 
you're going to look like you can't play the game. You look 
aggressive or too conservative. I know what I want to do, it's just 
sometimes I really can't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has done everything right this year except win a major. The  
PGA Championship represents the last chance of the 20th century for 
him to win his second major. There figures to be many more to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a handful of guys who threaten every major,'' Jay  
Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is one of them. Jack Nicklaus was the best at it.  
</P>
<P>
	When he was a kid, Woods kept a chart of everything Nicklaus  
accomplished, from his two U.S. Amateur titles to his 18 
professional majors. But Woods knows that Nicklaus' greatness goes 
beyond all the majors he won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack finished second in 19 majors,'' he said. ``How did he  
feel about it, losing that many times? But he also won 18. The key 
is to keep giving yourself enough chances. Eventually, you're going 
to win a few.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Scoffs at Dissenters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire scoffs at those who suggest that  
home runs have been cheapened due to expansion and a juiced 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading three-run homers with Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa in  
Chicago's 9-7 win over the Cardinals on Saturday, McGwire said the 
inflated power numbers throughout the major leagues means it's 
another golden age comparable to the 1950s and '60s, when several 
members of the 500-homer club had their heydays. 
</P>
<P>
	And so what if the club, which has only 16 members, swells in  
the next several years? McGwire said it's a matter of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generation after generation, they produce something,'' McGwire  
said. ``Right now, there's a lot of really good players in the game 
and people seem to want to write about: `Why is this all 
happening?' 
</P>
<P>
	``You know why it's happening: Because they're damn good. Write  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire caught up with his record 70-homer pace of last year,  
hitting No. 47 off rookie left-hander Micah Bowie. He also tied 
Eddie Murray for 15th place on the career list with 504 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the All-Star break, McGwire is batting .341 and homering  
every 4.8 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa ended with 66 homers last year and is only three behind  
McGwire's major league leading total after connecting off Darren 
Oliver in the seventh inning to put the Cubs ahead 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it, the players today are good,'' McGwire said.  
``Nobody ever writes that. They're damn good, and the players 20 
years from now are going to be better than us. I'm not surprised by 
anything I see anymore, because the players are really very good.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Tax Plan Hurts Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The GOP's $792 billion tax cut would reverse a  
quarter century of environmental progress, cutting pollution 
controls, stalling toxic waste cleanups, ``even shutting down 
national parks,'' President Clinton contended Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican budget plan ``would actually threaten our  
environment,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the spending proposal ``isn't simply turning back the  
clock on environmental protection. It's also turning its back on 
six years of fiscal responsibility and prudent investment -- a 
policy that's produced the strongest economy in a generation ... 
the largest surplus in our history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has promised to veto the package once Congress sends it  
to him after its August recess. He favors a budget plan that would 
strengthen the Social Security and Medicare systems and start 
paying off the national debt while permitting new investments in 
education, the environment, defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan also would provide a $300 billion tax cut over  
a period of years. 
</P>
<P>
	In his radio address, Clinton focused on the impact on the  
environment of a tax cut of the scope favored by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	He said their plan would ``require big cuts in environmental  
enforcement, letting toxic waste dumps fester, even shutting down 
national parks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also outlined new plans for cleaning up the nation's  
most polluted lakes, rivers and bays. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Environmental Protection Agency plans to work  
with states ``to assess the state of all our waterways, to identify 
the most polluted waters and to develop strong, enforceable plans 
to restore them to health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is a continuation of work begun in 1972 with passage of  
the federal Clean Water Act, he said, with a goal of producing 
water clean enough for swimming or fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite enormous progress under that landmark law, the president  
said, about 40 percent of the nation's waterways don't meet the 
swimming or fishing test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents have a right to expect that our recreational waters  
are safe for their children to swim in,'' Clinton said. ``All 
Americans have a right to expect we're doing all we can to clean up 
our waterways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The states and the EPA already have identified about 20,000  
polluted waterways that fail to meet national water quality 
standards, said Carol Browner, the EPA administrator. For each, 
states must produce individual cleanup plans with timetables for 
completion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The list includes about 300,000 miles of rivers and shoreline  
and close to 5 million acres of lakes, Browner said at a briefing 
for reporters.

<HEADLINE>  United 2, Crew 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jaime Moreno's penalty kick goal in the 58th  
minute broke a tie and D.C. United beat Columbus 2-1 Saturday for 
their third straight victory, completing a four-game season sweep 
of the Crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eastern Conference-leading United (16-7), who have won four  
of five, continued their domination of second-place Columbus at RFK 
Stadium and increased their lead over the Crew to eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno's opportunity came after a debatable call by referee  
Brian Hall, who ruled that Crew midfielder Jason Farrell roughly 
upended Marco Etcheverry in the penalty area. Replays indicated 
that Farrell never made contact, with Etcheverry either slipping on 
wet turf or stumbling over a waterlogged ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus (14-8) fell to 0-8 in regular-season play in  
Washington. The Crew's winning streak was halted at three games and 
Columbus was denied a chance to tie its franchise record of 15 
victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly acquired John Maessner also scored for D.C., while Jeff  
Cunningham scored for Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	The final 25 minutes of the first half were played in a  
torrential downpour, forcing players to slosh through a 
water-drenched field. 
</P>
<P>
	United withstood the deluge, outshot Columbus 8-5 and took a 1-0  
lead on Maessner's first goal since his last stint with D.C. a 
year-and-a-half ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Olsen's shot from just beyond the top of the penalty area  
knuckled off Maessner, a ninth-minute substitution for the injured 
Diego Sonora, and into the net vacated by goalie Mark Dougherty, 
who had moved up and to the left to defend Olson's shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely two minutes into a sunny second half, the Crew made it  
1-1 when Cunningham worked a pretty give-and-go with Brian McBride 
at the top of the box, converting a right-footed shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno's seventh goal came about 11 minutes later when he  
skipped a low shot past Dougherty on the penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus' best chance to tie the score came with 11 minutes left  
in regulation, when D.C.'s Mark Simpson, who had replaced injured 
goalie Tom Presthus in the 35th minute, made consecutive stops on 
Brian Maissoneuve. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew's Stern John sailed a shot wide right three minutes  
later, and with six minutes left, his apparent goal on a header was 
erased by a foul in the box. His backheel chance in traffic with a 
minute remaining was cleared.

<HEADLINE> Florida State Tops AP Football Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Florida State finds itself in a familiar position -- No. 1 in The  
Associated Press preseason college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fifth time since 1988, coach Bobby Bowden's Seminoles  
enter the season as favorites to win the national championship. 
This year's title game is at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough enough to win a national championship, but to be  
preseason No. 1 makes it doubly tough,'' Bowden said. ``We did it 
in '93, but never before or after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, the defending champs who knocked off Florida State in  
the Fiesta Bowl to complete a 13-0 season, is right behind at No. 2 
in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State, which won its only national title in 1993, also  
was a preseason No. 1 in 1988, '91, '93 and '95. The Seminoles have 
not started a season ranked lower than fifth in the AP preseason 
poll since '88. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm letting the cat out of the bag by saying  
winning a national title is our goal this year and every year,'' 
Bowden said. ``Let's get it on!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State is third, and Arizona fourth, but that should change  
in a hurry after the teams meet in the Pigskin Classic on Aug. 28 
in State College, Pa. The Seminoles open the season the same day 
against Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State received 48 first-place votes and 1,720 points  
from the 70 sports writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee had 15 first-place votes and 1,643 points, with No. 3  
Penn State collecting four first-place votes and 1,582 points and 
No. 4 Arizona one first-place vote and 1,537 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is No. 5 with one first-place vote and 1,361 points.  
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the Top 10 is No. 6 Nebraska, No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M, No.  
8 Michigan, No. 9 Ohio State and No. 10 Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Tech is No. 11, followed by No. 12 Miami, No. 13  
Virginia Tech (one first-place vote), No. 14 Georgia, No. 15 
Colorado, No. 16 UCLA, No. 17 Texas, No. 18 Notre Dame, No. 19 
Southern California and Alabama and Kansas State are tied at No. 
20. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas is No. 22, followed by No. 23 Purdue, No. 24 Virginia  
and No. 25 Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	The top five teams in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll are  
identical to those in the AP poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida schools have been ranked No. 1 in the AP preseason poll  
seven times in the 1990s. Miami was No. 1 in 1990 and '92, and 
Florida was No. 1 in '94. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the Top 10 teams are from the Big Ten Conference -- Penn  
State, Michigan, Ohio State and Wisconsin. The Southeastern, Big 
Ten and Big 12 conferences each have five teams in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams that finished in last year's final Top 25 but did not make  
the '99 preseason poll are: Tulane (No. 7 in '98); Air Force (No. 
13); Missouri (No. 21); and Syracuse (No. 25). 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1950, eight teams were ranked No. 1 in the preseason and  
went on to win the national title: Tennessee (1951); Michigan State 
(1952); Oklahoma (1956, 1974, 1975, 1985); Alabama (1978); and 
Florida State (1993). 
</P>
<P>
	No team has gone wire-to-wire ranked No. 1, but two teams --  
Nebraska in 1983 and Florida State in 1993 -- came close. 
</P>
<P>
	The '83 Cornhuskers went 12-0 before losing to Miami 31-30 in  
the Orange Bowl. The '93 Seminoles were No. 1 for most of the 
season, lost to Notre Dame but beat Nebraska in the Orange Bowl to 
claim the title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bowl Championship Series, in its second season, will match  
the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the Sugar Bowl based on standings 
compiled from the AP media poll and USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, 
eight computer rankings, strength-of-schedule and won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
	The final AP poll will be released Jan. 5.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- They often sit side-by-side in the dugout, at  
clubhouse card games or in the field while stretching before games. 
The king and prince of baseball thievery never miss a chance to 
discuss the secrets of their trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rickey Henderson, the career stolen base leader, has passed his  
wisdom on the art of stealing to Roger Cedeno, not coincidentally 
this season's major league leader. Together, they have transformed 
a New York Mets team that was one of the slowest in baseball last 
year, and helped it challenge for the National League East title. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is Cedeno that swipes most of the bases, no one  
deserves more credit for the change than the 40-year-old Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only does he jump-start the Mets at the top of the lineup,  
Henderson has helped the once inconsistent Cedeno develop into one 
of the top young players in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno was apprehensive at first about approaching the player he  
pretended to be as a child growing up in Venezuela. He finally got 
the nerve to talk to Henderson early in spring training and the two 
have been nearly inseparable ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to help young guys become successful,'' said Henderson,  
who stole a record 130 bases in 1982 when Cedeno was 8. ``Roger 
said I was an idol of his and he wanted to learn to play like me. 
We worked on his approach at the plate and base stealing. But even 
I'm surprised at his success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of that success can be credited to Henderson. He was never  
the fastest player in the game, but few players get as quick a jump 
or can break down an opposing pitcher's move as well as he can. So, 
before every game, Henderson goes over all the keys with Cedeno. 
</P>
<P>
	To most, the slight movements of the pitcher's hands or legs  
seem insignificant. To Henderson, they are the clues to when to 
break for the next base. Sometimes Cedeno even looks back into the 
dugout for a final piece of advice from Henderson after he reaches 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows more than Rickey?'' Cedeno said. ``I was always  
speedy, all I needed was the confidence and the experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows more than Henderson about stealing bases and  
getting on base. Probably the greatest leadoff hitter ever, 
Henderson has been one of the key acquisitions for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Mets leadoff hitters batted .237 with a .321 on-base  
percentage and 15 steals. Henderson was hitting .320, with a .449 
on-base percentage, 29 steals and 64 runs through Friday. He's 
stolen a total of 1,326 bases in his career and is fifth in runs 
scored, third in walks. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson is showing few signs of slowing down and could reach  
those records in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is getting better with age,'' manager Bobby Valentine said.  
``Every day he goes out there with the same determination he did 20 
years ago and I think he's better or equal to the way he was 20 
years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets see many of those same traits in Cedeno, who had the  
potential to be a great basestealer but never got the chance to 
prove it until he was traded from Los Angeles to New York last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought he was rushed to the major leagues, but that he had  
All-Star ability, those kinds of tools,'' said Mets GM Steve 
Phillips, who made his own steal, acquiring Cedeno and reliever 
Armando Benitez in a three-way deal for Todd Hundley and a minor 
league pitcher. ``He just seemed a little timid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno, once a top prospect in the Dodgers system, spent four  
frustrating seasons shuttling between Los Angeles and the minors. 
He was a part-time player who spent as much time looking into the 
dugout out of fear as he did concentrating on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything goes wrong, they were waiting to yell at me in the  
dugout,'' Cedeno said. ``I was afraid to make a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cedeno, who turns 25 on Monday, has made few mistakes with New  
York. He is hitting .311 with an on-base percentage of .399, higher 
than all but one Dodgers regular. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really seen him this confident ever,'' said Mike  
Piazza, who played with Cedeno in Los Angeles. ``He's comfortable 
here. He knows he's been accepted here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazingly, the Dodgers never gave Cedeno the green light to  
steal. In 311 games with Los Angeles, Cedeno stole 23 bases. 
Already this season, he has 58, matching a Mets record. The team 
has 118 stolen bases, nearly double last year's total of 62. 
</P>
<P>
	And Cedeno still hasn't reached his full potential.  
</P>
<P>
	``Eighty or 90 percent of what he's doing is pure ability,''  
Henderson said. ``He still has to learn how to get a better jump. 
He has to learn how to use his speed so he's not going full-out all 
the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson, who proclaimed himself the ``greatest of all-time''  
after breaking Lou Brock's career steals record in 1991, is not 
concerned that he won't be the stolen base king of his own team for 
the first time in a non-strike season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to outdo nobody, so it's not a contest,''  
Henderson said. ``Roger just runs. I just try to create stuff. I 
don't need to steal any more bases. I don't think anybody will ever 
catch me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even his speedy protege.

<HEADLINE> New Reds Ownership on Deck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Cincinnati Reds' new ownership group  
expects to have an agreement ready for baseball owners to consider 
at their meeting Sept. 15-16 in Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the plan,'' limited partner Bill Reik said Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati financier Carl Lindner, Reik and another limited  
partner have agreed to buy out Marge Schott's controlling interest 
in the club for $67 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott signed the deal on April 20. The limited partners have  
been working out details of how the new ownership group will 
operate with Lindner as the controlling partner. 
</P>
<P>
	If the agreement is approved in Cooperstown, the Reds could be  
under new ownership on Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE>  Kyle Petty's Home Destroyed in Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLE OF PALMS, S.C. (AP) -- The homes of stock car driver Kyle  
Petty and Sen. Fritz Hollings were destroyed in a fire that swept 
through an upscale beach community. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire Friday at Wild Dunes began around sundown in one  
beachfront house, moved to Petty's house then crossed the street to 
Hollings' house. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty was not at home. Earlier in the day, he qualified 25th for  
the Frontier at the Glen NASCAR Winston Cup race in Watkins Glen, 
N.Y. Petty's publicist Chip Williams said Petty was staying at the 
Watkins Glen International race track in New York on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It spread rapidly,'' said Isle of Palms Fire Chief Ann Graham.  
``It was like a firestorm in there. Luckily no one was hurt. The 
property can be replaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials weren't immediately sure what caused the blaze, but  
said it caused millions of dollars worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollings and his wife, Peatsy, were in the house at the time of  
the fire, but were able to get out safely, said Maury Lane, 
Hollings' spokesman. They were staying with friends in Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, five houses burned before firefighters got the blaze  
under control, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a massive fire. I've never seen anything like it,''  
said Graham, who has been with the department since 1985. ``If it 
weren't for the cooperation (of other departments), we'd be out 
here for days.''

<HEADLINE> Holmgrem Has High Hopes for 'Hawks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- When Mike Holmgren flew from Seattle to San  
Francisco last spring he found himself next to Ricky Watters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't usually like to sit with my players,'' the new coach  
and general manager of the Seahawks says. ``But in this case, I 
took advantage of the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren didn't waste time trying to turn Watters, a chronic  
whiner, into a team leader. And so far, the running back has hardly 
uttered a word about his coach's desire to give more playing time 
to second-year man Ahman Green. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, one man can change attitudes on an underachieving team.  
Especially when it's Holmgren, who's earned respect by winning 
consistently wherever he's gone. He's won three Super Bowl rings, 
two as an assistant in San Francisco and one as head coach of the 
Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks haven't won anything recently. The last time they  
made the playoffs was 1988, the longest drought in the NFL. Under 
Dennis Erickson, whom Holmgren replaced, they went 8-8, 7-9, 8-8 
and 8-8 despite having many big-name players. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren buys the underachieving argument only to a point.  
</P>
<P>
	``Quite often,'' he says, ``players perceived by the public as  
stars aren't necessary big-time players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, no one argues that there's talent here: the likes of  
Watters and Joey Galloway on offense and Cortez Kennedy, Michael 
Sinclair and Chad Brown on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at underachieving this way,'' says defensive tackle Sam  
Adams, one of the prime examples. ``We set a record last year for 
touchdowns off turnovers. But we were 27th in the league on 
defense. That says a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, a first-round draft pick in 1994 who hasn't lived up to  
his promise, dropped 30 pounds to 313 this spring after Holmgren 
threatened to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren, a former school teacher, is hardly of the Vince  
Lombardi-Bill Parcells-Bill Cowher mode. He's viewed as more 
cerebral than threatening, a former quarterback who learned under 
Bill Walsh in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	But that's deceptive, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren spent most of last year grumpy because of the  
perception in Green Bay that he was about to leave. He even shouted 
at a fan once as he was leaving the field at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife and I were watching the replay and I said, 'Wow!''  
Holmgren recalls. ``She said 'You're not like that' and I said, 'I 
was this time.' It was uncalled for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first meeting with his new team, Holmgren gave the  
players a simple formula: 
</P>
<P>
	``Listen to what I tell you and do it. If you do, three things  
can happen: One, it will work and you'll get credit. Two, it won't 
work and I'll get the blame. Three, you'll do it wrong and you'll 
be gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Holmgren's style are rules that instill group thinking:  
no bandanas and no sleeveless shirts at meals, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sometimes he has rules just for the sake of having  
rules,'' says Watters, who was a rookie on injured reserve in 1991 
when Holmgren was offensive coordinator with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
	The other players buy into it because of Holmgren's reputation.  
</P>
<P>
	``Eight years ago, to go out to Green Bay was like going to  
Alcatraz. It was a death sentence. Nobody wanted to go there,'' 
says Sinclair, who led the league with 16 1/2 sacks last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the proof is in the pudding. You go there, bring that  
program around and you've done something. Our guys see what he did 
and we know he can do it here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren is tough when necessary.  
</P>
<P>
	On the first day of training camp, he blew his whistle after a  
botched play, strode into the huddle, and tore into his offense. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer ran a photo on the  
front of its sports section of Holmgren, his lips rolled up in a 
sneer, chewing out his players. On the front page of the paper was 
a shot of him picking up a baby during a post-practice autograph 
session, and smiling broadly. 
</P>
<P>
	Which one is the real Holmgren?  
</P>
<P>
	``The one on the front page, of course,'' he said the next day,  
chortling. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren aside, it's easy to project the Seahawks as a playoff  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of their losses last season were by a total of nine  
points, including the one-point defeat to the Jets when Vinny 
Testaverde was incorrectly ruled over the goal line on a 
fourth-down play with seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	But questions remain, the biggest one at quarterback.  
</P>
<P>
	The incumbent is Jon Kitna, who took over from 41-year-old  
Warren Moon last season and started the final five games to mixed 
reviews. Kitna, a local hero who was undrafted out of Central 
Washington and made his reputation in NFL Europe, still throws 
wobblers on out patterns, but seems to have the confidence and 
cockiness of most top QBs. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind him is Glenn Foley, obtained from the Jets, where he got  
hurt every time he seemed ready to shine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jon is still learning the offense, which is why I don't worry  
about the wobblers,'' Holmgren says. ``But yes, I'll acknowledge 
that quarterback is the biggest question mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmgren also can use a receiving alternative to Galloway, who  
was a holdout during the early days of camp. Last year, when teams 
double-teamed him, the offense bogged down. 
</P>
<P>
	But Holmgren doesn't worry about that. He has plans to spring  
Galloway, one of the NFL's fastest receivers, on the crossing 
routes that he used with Jerry Rice as offensive coordinator in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	So, not only are the Seahawks excited, so are their fans, who  
will get a new stadium in two years to replaced the drab Kingdome, 
which they've deserted after flocking there a decade ago to watch 
playoff teams led by Steve Largent, Dave Krieg and Curt Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not be excited?'' Kitna says. ``Why not think about  
opening day? Why not think Super Bowl? I do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, one man can change a lot.

<HEADLINE> Royals Revamp Bullpen With Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals continued to  
revamp their struggling bullpen Saturday with four moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals made room on their roster for right-handers Derek  
Wallace and Chris Fussell by waiving left-hander Matt Whisenant and 
right-hander Terry Mathews. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, acquired from the New York Mets on Friday for minor  
league pitcher Jeremy Jackson, was activated and Fussell was 
recalled from Triple-A Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Royals manager Tony Muser said Whisenant, 28, who was 4-4 with a  
6.35 ERA and one save, simply ran out of chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathews, 34, 2-1 with a 4.38 ERA and one save, was a victim of  
Kansas City's youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't sit with the bullpen and stay with what we've seen  
all year,'' said Muser, whose bullpen has blown 25 saves this 
season. ``Sometimes you have to tear down to build up and you can't 
get away from young people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need people to throw strikes and not walk people. We took a  
chance on Matt and brought him to this point to be a quality set-up 
guy and that just didn't happen.''

<HEADLINE>  Militant Students Rally in S. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Police cordoned off a Seoul campus  
where 3,000 leftist students held an outlawed rally today to call 
for unification of South and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	After resting in the shade, students gathered in the late  
afternoon to kick off their annual pro-unification rally in Seoul 
National University with calls to end Seoul's anti-communist 
national security law and U.S. military presence. 
</P>
<P>
	Students say the law and 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea  
hinder reconciliation between the capitalist South and communist 
North. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seoul government views such demands as pro-communist and  
seditious, and promised to punish those who organized the campus 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally will culminate Sunday when the students attempt to  
march to the border area to jointly celebrate Korean Liberation Day 
with their North Korean counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea considered the border festival a stage for  
anti-Seoul propaganda, and outlawed attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Police vowed to trap the students in the campus. Students said  
they would force their way through the police cordon, raising fears 
of violent clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the school's several entrances, police stopped students and  
searched their bags for fire bombs and other protest gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Koreas celebrates Liberation Day to mark the peninsula's  
liberation from 36 years of Japanese colonial rule, which ended 
with Japan's World War II defeat in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	As in recent years, North Korea sponsored a festival at  
Panmunjom, a village inside the Demilitarized Zone separating the 
two Koreas, and invited South Koreans to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by the students to attend similar events in the past  
have resulted in violent clashes with riot police. 
</P>
<P>
	Six South Korean dissidents broke an official taboo in visiting  
the communist North and traveled to attend the North 
Korean-sponsored festival. They face arrest if and when they return 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	After liberation, the peninsula was divided into communist North  
Korea and capitalist South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Koreas fought a three-year war that ended without a  
peace treaty in 1953. Mutual distrust remains deep and the border 
is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million troops on both 
sides.

<HEADLINE>  Colombians Mourn Slain Comic Garzon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Around 15,000 Colombians crowded in a  
downtown square Saturday to mourn slain comic Jaime Garzon and 
express outrage at the chronic political violence that apparently 
took the life of the country's most beloved satirist. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the mourners from above Garzon's casket on the  
Capitol's steps, his sister, Marisol, blamed a ``culture of 
violence'' for Friday's killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaime's death wasn't just the demented action of a group of  
bad people. It was the result of a culture of violence that has 
grown throughout the century. We are all responsible for this 
violence between brothers -- especially the historic rulers on the 
left and the right,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As she spoke, people in the front of the crowd chanted: ``The  
government killed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon, 38, was shot as he drove to work at a Bogota radio  
station. The slaying stunned the nation and raised fears that 
Colombia's civil conflict is spiraling out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	The mourners, gathered in the capital's downtown Bolivar Plaza,  
shouted slogans demanding an end to 35 years of violence in which 
right-wing paramilitary militias and leftist rebels regularly 
target civilians they accuse of collaborating with their enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon's death came amid growing violence and political  
polarization as the peace initiative launched by President Andres 
Pastrana a year ago appears to be faltering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that Jaime's death is not in vain ... I wish it could  
be the last violent death,'' said Garzon's common-law wife, Cecilia 
Hernandez. ``Our people are tired of suffering, and only few are 
interested in continuing the violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon had worked as an intermediary to release hostages held by  
leftist rebels and had been active in local elections. But he was 
best known for his television and radio shows, where he displayed 
biting humor and an affinity with the downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
	One mourner on Saturday held a Colombian flag splattered with  
red paint. Others waved a banner with the slogan ``Laughing 
ourselves to death.'' Many more waved signs reading ``No More.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The peaceful gathering included many families and children, but  
riot police armed with a water cannon discretely ringed the square. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands more lined the route taken by the funeral procession  
as it took Garzon's remains to a cemetery in northern Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	On Bogota's major north-south highway, a footbridge crowded with  
spectators anticipating the funeral procession's arrival collapsed, 
killing two people and injuring 14, police said. However, the 
bridge wasn't on the motorcade route. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's newspapers dedicated entire pages to the comic whose  
caustic wit often targeted the corruption and vanity of the rich 
and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	In one telephone prank, Garzon -- impersonating former President  
Ernesto Samper -- told a government aide he was to be named as a 
government minister the next day. The official didn't realize he 
had been fooled until after he had made his children dress up for 
the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon was shot as he drove to work at Radionet, the all-news  
network where he was a morning show co-host. He was killed almost 
instantly by five shots fired into his head and chest by a gunman 
who approached his car while he was stopped at a red light, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleagues and relatives said Garzon had often told them of  
receiving death threats from right-wing paramilitary militias. 
Garzon's sister said he had become more careful about his movements 
lately, although he refused bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
	Several radio stations received anonymous claims of  
responsibility from callers who said they represented paramilitary 
groups. But the radio network Caracol received a statement signed 
by the paramilitary umbrella group, the United Self-Defense Forces 
of Colombia, denying responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the radio station, paramilitary chief Carlos  
Castana said he had planned to meet with Garzon on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, Garzon had also met leftist rebels to help  
facilitate the release of kidnap victims. On Friday, he had been 
scheduled to meet with leaders of the National Liberation Army, 
Colombia's second-largest rebel group, to help negotiate the 
release of civilian hostages held by the guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Pee Wee Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop  
and Brooklyn Dodgers captain whose leadership and example helped 
ease the way for Jackie Robinson to break baseball's color barrier, 
died Saturday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese died at his home in Louisville, said Lori Young of the  
Pearson Funeral Home. The cause of death was not given. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese, who overcame prostate cancer years ago, underwent  
radiation treatment for lung cancer in March 1997 after doctors 
removed a malignant tumor. He also was recovering from a broken hip 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags at Dodger Stadium were flown at half-staff for Saturday  
night's game against Atlanta. A moment of silence was observed and 
a one-minute highlight film of Reese's career was shown on the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-time All-Star, Reese sparked the Dodgers to seven  
National League pennants. He led Brooklyn to its only World Series 
championship in 1955, fielding the final ball in a 2-0 victory in 
Game 7 at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese was inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 1984. A  
regular at the induction ceremonies at Cooperstown, N.Y., until 
recent years, he was not at the shrine three weeks ago for the 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pee Wee was one of the guys on the Dodgers who we -- I mean the  
black guys -- could look to for leadership,'' said pitcher Don 
Newcombe, who played eight years with Reese. ``Jackie would tell us 
who the nice guys were and who wasn't. And Pee Wee was surely one 
of the nice guys -- one you could trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his calm leadership, sure-handed fielding and clutch  
hits, Reese played a key role in easing Robinson's road into the 
majors in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	During one particularly tough time when the abuse was getting  
ugly at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, Reese walked over to Robinson 
and put his arm over the rookie's shoulder, a show of unity from a 
white to a black that spoke volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a big picture of it, both of us laughing, hanging in  
my den,'' Reese said a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That moment is cited as a turning point in Robinson's  
transition. Later, Reese and Robinson would play golf and tennis 
together on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1972 book ``The Boys of Summer,'' author Roger Kahn  
hailed Reese as a ``catalyst of baseball integration'' for his 
friendship with Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese recalled that after hearing the Dodger organization had  
hired a black player, he thought, ``If he's man enough to take my 
job, I'm not gonna like it, but, dammit, black or white, he 
deserves it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when I went over to talk to him on the field,  
thinking that people would see this and figure we were friends and 
this would help Jack,'' Reese told Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully recalled that day at  
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a message sent to one and all that a boy from the  
South puts his arms around a black man and says, `Hey, we're equal, 
we're teammates, and we're in this thing together.' And that was 
typical of Pee Wee,'' Scully said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the heart and soul of the `Boys of Summer.' If a player  
needed to be consoled, Pee Wee would console him. If a player 
needed to be kicked in the fanny, Pee Wee would do that, too. If a 
player really needed a friend, Pee Wee was there for him,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Henry Reese was born on July 23, 1918, on a farm in  
Ekron, Ky., and moved to Louisville with his family as a child. As 
a boy, he once was runner-up to the national champion in The 
Courier-Journal marble tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he gained the nickname of Pee Wee not because of his  
size -- he was listed at 5-foot-10 and 160 pounds -- but from his 
youthful prowess at marbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese was first signed by the Louisville Colonels of the  
American Association in 1937. ``The Little Colonel,'' as he was 
called, batted .269 in a career that spanned 1940-58 and included 
the Dodgers' first year in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	But his offensive career totals -- 126 home runs, 885 RBIs -- did  
not begin to measure his value to the Dodgers, or to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard the expression about several former Dodgers that  
this one or that one was the greatest Dodger who ever lived,'' 
former teammate and fellow Hall of Famer Duke Snider said. ``In my 
estimation, Pee Wee Reese was the greatest Dodger whoever lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, a group that included Boston Red Sox owner Tom  
Yawkey purchased the Colonels for $195,000, largely because it 
wanted Reese's contract. Later that year, the club sold Reese to 
the Dodgers for the equivalent of $75,000 ($35,000 in cash and four 
players). 
</P>
<P>
	Reese broke into the major leagues in 1940 and displaced Dodgers  
regular Leo Durocher, beginning a 16-year tenure at shortstop 
interrupted by a three-year stint in the Navy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the NL in stolen bases with 30 in 1952 and in runs scored  
with 132 in 1947. Reese also topped the league in double plays four 
times and in fielding average (.977 in 1949). 
</P>
<P>
	After his baseball career, Reese worked as a broadcaster with  
CBS, NBC and the Cincinnati Reds. He later became director of the 
college and professional baseball staff at Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, 
maker of Louisville Slugger bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese married Dorothy Walton on March 29, 1942. They had two  
children, Barbara and Mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not to be finalized until Sunday.

<HEADLINE>  Colombians Mourn Slain Comic Garzon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Around 15,000 Colombians crowded in a  
downtown square Saturday to mourn slain comic Jaime Garzon and 
express outrage at the chronic political violence that apparently 
took the life of the country's most beloved satirist. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the mourners from above Garzon's casket on the  
Capitol's steps, his sister, Marisol, blamed a ``culture of 
violence'' for Friday's killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaime's death wasn't just the demented action of a group of  
bad people. It was the result of a culture of violence that has 
grown throughout the century. We are all responsible for this 
violence between brothers -- especially the historic rulers on the 
left and the right,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As she spoke, people in the front of the crowd chanted: ``The  
government killed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon, 38, was shot as he drove to work at a Bogota radio

Colombia's civil conflict is spiraling out of control.

<HEADLINE>  Bush Wins Iowa Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush cemented his front-runner  
status Saturday night with a convincing victory in the Iowa straw 
poll, passing an early test of political potency that could unravel 
other Republican presidential campaigns. The Texas governor said 
he's ``on the road to winning the nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole finished second and third in the  
nonbinding poll. Weak showings by former Vice President Dan Quayle 
and Lamar Alexander staggered their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, is almost certain to  
drop out of the race, sources close to his campaign said. Quayle 
faces deep troubles as well. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of nine White House hopefuls poured millions of dollars  
and spent hundreds of hours in this initial caucus state to test 
their political strength. Iowans were bussed from across the state 
to feast on free food and music provided by the vote-hungry 
candidates. With carnival tents and stale popcorn, the event looked 
more like a state fair than a political trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This victory today in Iowa put me on the road to winning the  
nomination of the Republican Party,'' declared Bush, who was 
criticized by nearly every one of his rivals in their addresses 
earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who had hoped for better results, found a measure of  
solace in ``the fact that two-thirds of the voters did not vote 
for'' Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no straw poll winner ever has won the GOP nomination, the  
contest has helped and hurt any number of candidacies ahead of the 
first real votes of the campaign season, the Iowa caucuses and the 
New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush received nearly one third of the straw poll vote, or 7,418.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' second-place finish was solid but somewhat  
disappointing. Having outspent the entire field, the millionaire 
conservative had hoped to show his money and message made him a 
serious vote-getter. He received 4,921 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, a former president of the American Red Cross, had 3,410  
votes -- a solid showing for a first-time presidential candidate 
trying to expand the party's base to include more young and 
professional women. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, she declared her showing ``a great victory.''  
She said ``about 50 percent of the people who voted for me are new 
to the process, and it appears that two-thirds of our voters are 
women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, with 1,428 votes, and Quayle, with 916 votes and an  
eighth-place finish, were the night's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's spokesman said the former vice president is in the race  
for the long haul. ``No changes. No wiggle room,'' spokesman 
Jonathan Baron said. ``We're going to conserve our resources and we 
plan to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his finish behind three other conservative contenders --  
Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes -- could dry up his 
fund-raising sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's money problems are already severe. Aides said  
shortly before the vote that he would drop out if he finished lower 
than fourth; he finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	After a closed-door meeting, Alexander's staff left the arena.  
One aide had tears in his eyes. The former Tennessee governor has 
been running for president virtually nonstop for six years, having 
lost the 1996 nomination deeper into the primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go back to Tennessee tomorrow to consider our  
options,'' said Mike Tuffin, Alexander's New Hampshire field 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the candidates was allotted a total of 13 minutes to  
address the crowd -- and for ``spontaneous'' demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Introduced amid a burst of fireworks, patriotic tunes and a  
spray of balloons, Forbes didn't mention Bush by name but took 
steady aim at the Texas governor. ``The power of these Washington 
elites won't be tamed, bent or broken by a candidate who relies on 
pollsters and tutors to tell him what he thinks,'' he told a 
capacity straw poll crowd numbering more than 24,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a higher road, Bush called his rivals ``fine candidates''  
and stuck to his standard speech -- delivered with little passion. 
``Together, we will prove that someone who is conservative and 
compassionate can win without sacrificing principles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's supporters declared that the victory solidifies his  
standing as the GOP front-runner. They suggested that the results 
should thin the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that, though this is not a scientific process and even  
though some demean it, you just have to take stock of where you are 
-- whether you can raise the money and whether you can continue,'' 
said Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, one of Bush's closest political 
allies. He was in Iowa to campaign for the Texas governor.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Claim Wide Receiver Sellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Eagles claimed wide  
receiver Donald Sellers off waivers from the St. Louis Rams on 
Saturday and waived wide receiver Eric Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers, 24, played for the Scottish Claymores of the NFL Europe  
League last spring, collecting a league-best 931 receiving yards on 
58 catches. His seven touchdown receptions ranked fourth in the 
league, while his 946 total yards from scrimmage ranked third in 
NFL Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers originally was signed by St. Louis as a rookie free  
agent quarterback in 1997. After being released by the Rams during 
the '97 training camp, Sellers re-signed with the Rams in 1998 and 
spent the majority of the season on the practice squad. He was a 
two-year starter as a quarterback at New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Closes Historic Mich. Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co. on Saturday announced it  
would close most of its historic hometown plant and cut about 550 
jobs in its latest effort to revive a sagging bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuing to reduce costs and increase efficiencies is an  
important part of our global strategy to return Kellogg Company to 
strong, steady growth,'' said President and CEO Carlos M. 
Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision is a heavy blow to this city where the scent of  
freshly baked cereal often permeates the air and generations of 
families have banked on work with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they could try a little bit harder to bring more jobs  
in here. The community is going to suffer tremendously, as are 
we,'' said Debra Robinson, who has worked in Kellogg's warehouse 
for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said restructuring its business would result in a  
charge of $100 million to $150 million against earnings this 
quarter, with more charges expected later this year and early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg is the third-largest employer in this community of  
56,000, which calls itself ``Cereal City.'' The company said would 
offer assistance to workers whose jobs are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	The closure is the latest change at the financially troubled  
company, whose annual earnings dropped 21 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Though still the world's top manufacturer of ready-to-eat  
cereals, Kellogg has been hurt by competition from cheaper, 
store-brand cereals, as well as market-wide demographic changes. 
Fewer Americans are eating cereal in the morning, preferring 
convenience foods that can be eaten on the run, like bagels, 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg had announced in June it was considering closing the  
aging South Plant to save an estimated $35 million to $45 million 
annually and reduce excess cereal production. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 2,250 employees in Battle Creek, where the cereal  
giant was founded in 1906. About 1,100 people work at the South 
Plant. The rest work at corporate headquarters, research or the 
North Plant, all of which would not be affected by the proposed 
shutdown. Kellogg has 6,400 jobs in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the closure would begin later this year and end  
in the first three months of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty sure it was coming,'' said Rick Brown, 48, who  
has been with the company for 22 years. With his $22-an-hour 
position, he doubts whether he will find such well-paying work if 
his job is among those jettisoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it is they need more money to line their  
pockets,'' said Mark Erskine, who has worked 20 years as a machine 
operator. ``There's nothing wrong with this plant. They've got a 
world-class workforce.''

<HEADLINE> Students Set To Return to Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- With armed guards at the entrance and  
dozens of police officers patrolling the neighborhood, students 
will return to Columbine High School for classes Monday for the 
first time since last spring's deadly rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Before classes begin, Principal Frank DeAngelis will lead the  
students, teachers and staff in a ``take back the school'' rally 
and will raise a U.S. flag that has been at half-staff since the 
April 20 attack. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been nearly four months since seniors Eric Harris, 18, and  
Dylan Klebold, 17, attacked with guns and bombs, killing a dozen 
classmates and a teacher and injuring 23 others before committing 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Lapp, 16, who witnessed several of the killings, said he  
and others feel nervous about returning, but he especially dreads 
facing the mob of cameras and reporters expected at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather just be in class,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, 2,000 Denver area youths turned out at  
Fiddler's Green amphitheater for ``Columbine &AMP; Friends,'' a 
Christian inspirational rally organized by teens with support from 
Littleton congregations. One of the performing bands was led by 
Stephen and Jon Cohen, members of the Bible club at Columbine High 
School, whose tribute song to slain students, ``Columbine Friend of 
Mine,'' has sold 40,000 records. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and alumni plan to shield students and teachers from the  
media attention by forming a human barrier along a path between a 
secured parking lot and the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullet and shrapnel holes have been plastered and painted over.  
There's a new wall blocking the entrance to the second-floor 
library, where most of the victims died. 
</P>
<P>
	Security has been tightened. All students must wear  
identification badges. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nearly 2,000 students will not have to pass through  
metal detectors or let anyone check backpacks. And the extra police 
on hand Monday will handle primarily traffic and crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard shortly after the tragedy and from lots of people --  
students, staff, parents -- that they didn't want their school to be 
turned into a fortress,'' said school district spokesman Rick 
Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
	Two mental health counselors will join the regular staff of six  
counselors, in case the return is emotionally jarring for any 
student or teacher. There will also be a safe room in the school 
for anyone who needs special attention during the first week of 
class. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to make changes. I think it will make it easier for  
kids who saw things,'' said Lindsey Neam, a senior. ``But for 
others it might make it harder, because kids just want things to be 
the same. They want to get back to normal.''

<HEADLINE> Florida State Tops AP Football Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Florida State finds itself in a familiar position -- No. 1 in The  
Associated Press preseason college football poll. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fifth time since 1988, coach Bobby Bowden's Seminoles  
enter the season as favorites to win the national championship. 
This year's title game is at the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough enough to win a national championship, but to be  
preseason No. 1 makes it doubly tough,'' Bowden said. ``We did it 
in '93, but never before or after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, the defending champs who knocked off Florida State in  
the Fiesta Bowl to complete a 13-0 season, is right behind at No. 2 
in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State, which won its only national title in 1993, also  
was a preseason No. 1 in 1988, '91, '93 and '95. The Seminoles have 
not started a season ranked lower than fifth in the AP preseason 
poll since '88. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm letting the cat out of the bag by saying  
winning a national title is our goal this year and every year,'' 
Bowden said. ``Let's get it on!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State is third, and Arizona fourth, but that should change  
in a hurry after the teams meet in the Pigskin Classic on Aug. 28 
in State College, Pa. The Seminoles open the season the same day 
against Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State received 48 first-place votes and 1,720 points  
from the 70 sports writers and broadcasters on the AP panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee had 15 first-place votes and 1,643 points, with No. 3  
Penn State collecting four first-place votes and 1,582 points and 
No. 4 Arizona one first-place vote and 1,537 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is No. 5 with one first-place vote and 1,361 points.  
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the Top 10 is No. 6 Nebraska, No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M, No.  
8 Michigan, No. 9 Ohio State and No. 10 Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia Tech is No. 11, followed by No. 12 Miami, No. 13  
Virginia Tech (one first-place vote), No. 14 Georgia, No. 15 
Colorado, No. 16 UCLA, No. 17 Texas, No. 18 Notre Dame, No. 19 
Southern California and Alabama and Kansas State are tied at No. 
20. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas is No. 22, followed by No. 23 Purdue, No. 24 Virginia  
and No. 25 Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
	The top five teams in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll are  
identical to those in the AP poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida schools have been ranked No. 1 in the AP preseason poll  
seven times in the 1990s. Miami was No. 1 in 1990 and '92, and 
Florida was No. 1 in '94. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the Top 10 teams are from the Big Ten Conference -- Penn  
State, Michigan, Ohio State and Wisconsin. The Southeastern, Big 
Ten and Big 12 conferences each have five teams in the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams that finished in last year's final Top 25 but did not make  
the '99 preseason poll are: Tulane (No. 7 in '98); Air Force (No. 
13); Missouri (No. 21); and Syracuse (No. 25). 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1950, eight teams were ranked No. 1 in the preseason and  
went on to win the national title: Tennessee (1951); Michigan State 
(1952); Oklahoma (1956, 1974, 1975, 1985); Alabama (1978); and 
Florida State (1993). 
</P>
<P>
	No team has gone wire-to-wire ranked No. 1, but two teams --  
Nebraska in 1983 and Florida State in 1993 -- came close. 
</P>
<P>
	The '83 Cornhuskers went 12-0 before losing to Miami 31-30 in  
the Orange Bowl. The '93 Seminoles were No. 1 for most of the 
season, lost to Notre Dame but beat Nebraska in the Orange Bowl to 
claim the title. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bowl Championship Series, in its second season, will match  
the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the Sugar Bowl based on standings 
compiled from the AP media poll and USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, 
eight computer rankings, strength-of-schedule and won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
	The final AP poll will be released Jan. 5.

<HEADLINE> Popular Attorney Killed in Southwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- As friends and relatives struggled to cope  
with the drive-by shooting death of a popular attorney, a man the 
lawyer once defended was wanted for questioning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Vigil, 52, an attorney known for taking hard-luck cases,  
was shot Friday morning just after he left his law office. He died 
on a sidewalk just yards from the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you can do is live your life. You represent your clients  
and do the best you can,'' said Steve Farber, a longtime friend of 
Vigil and former City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just still trying to get over the shock right now,''  
said Vigil's widow, Andrea. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were searching for Miguel Trujillo, 40, who was ``armed  
and dangerous'' and wanted for questioning, police Capt. David 
Segura said late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped short of calling Trujillo a suspect, but Segura  
earlier said police were looking for only one man in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``His case files are extensive. We're not sure if (the shooting)  
is related to cases, or to other matters,'' Segura said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Vigil family friend, Espanola Municipal Judge Charles Maestas,  
said Vigil had represented Trujillo in his court last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Maestas said Trujillo pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and  
a misdemeanor charge of assaulting a police officer, and he 
sentenced him to 20 days already served. 
</P>
<P>
	Vigil had filed a harassment complaint against Trujillo on  
Thursday, Maestas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses saw a pickup truck with a loud muffler, possibly  
driven by a man in his 20s, leaving the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Vigil's death stunned friends and colleagues at the courthouse,  
where offices closed at noon because of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This brings home the reality of the violence we deal with on a  
daily basis,'' said Assistant District Attorney Angela Pacheco, who 
prosecuted some of Vigil's clients. ``This brings it to the 
forefront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vigil was killed as he headed to an arraignment for a  
23-year-old woman charged with murder in the death of a newborn 
found floating in an apartment toilet. Vigil was her attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people would get in trouble and people here would  
say, 'Go see Carlos,''' said Rio Arriba County Manager Lorenzo 
Valdez, a lifelong friend. ``He'd take cases a lot of times that 
other people wouldn't touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vigil defended a man convicted in 1996 of helping snip the ears  
off a pit bull puppy, and represented Rio Arriba County when 
firefighters claimed they were improperly fired. 
</P>
<P>
	He took ``cases that he might not even think he'd get paid for,  
contingency cases that he wasn't sure he'd even win, but that he 
took out of the goodness of his heart,'' said Tomas Campos, 
assistant Rio Arriba County manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleagues said Vigil sometimes charged clients only what they  
could afford to pay. And it wasn't always money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carlos would get paid in chickens or vegetables from his  
clients,'' Aaron Wolf, an attorney and friend of Vigil's, told 
today's Albuquerque Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They paid him what they had,'' Mrs. Vigil said. ``They even  
paid with firewood, and I don't even have a fireplace.''

<HEADLINE>  Bush Wins Iowa Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush cemented his front-runner  
status Saturday night with a convincing victory in the Iowa straw 
poll, passing an early test of political potency that could unravel 
other Republican presidential campaigns. The Texas governor said 
he's ``on the road to winning the nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole finished second and third in the  
nonbinding poll. Weak showings by former Vice President Dan Quayle 
and Lamar Alexander staggered their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, is almost certain to  
drop out of the race, sources close to his campaign said. Quayle 
faces deep troubles as well. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of nine White House hopefuls poured millions of dollars  
and spent hundreds of hours in this initial caucus state to test 
their political strength. Iowans were bussed from across the state 
to feast on free food and music provided by the vote-hungry 
candidates. With carnival tents and stale popcorn, the event looked 
more like a state fair than a political trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This victory today in Iowa put me on the road to winning the  
nomination of the Republican Party,'' declared Bush, who was 
criticized by nearly every one of his rivals in their addresses 
earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who had hoped for better results, found a measure of  
solace in ``the fact that two-thirds of the voters did not vote 
for'' Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no straw poll winner ever has won the GOP nomination, the  
contest has helped and hurt any number of candidacies ahead of the 
first real votes of the campaign season, the Iowa caucuses and the 
New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush received nearly one third of the straw poll vote, or 7,418.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' second-place finish was solid but somewhat  
disappointing. Having outspent the entire field, the millionaire 
conservative had hoped to show his money and message made him a 
serious vote-getter. He received 4,921 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, former president of the American Red Cross, had  
3,410 -- a solid showing for a first-time presidential candidate 
trying to expand the party's base to include more young and 
professional women. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, with 1,428 votes, and Quayle, with 916 votes and an  
eighth-place finish, were the night's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's spokesman said the former vice president is in the race  
for the long haul. ``No changes. No wiggle room,'' spokesman 
Jonathan Baron said. ``We're going to conserve our resources and we 
plan to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his finish behind three other conservative contenders --  
Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes -- could dry up his 
fund-raising sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's money problems are already severe. Aides said  
shortly before the vote that he would drop out if he finished lower 
than fourth; he finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	After a closed-door meeting, Alexander's staff left the arena.  
One aide had tears in his eyes. The former Tennessee governor has 
been running for president virtually nonstop for six years, having 
lost the 1996 nomination deeper into the primary season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go back to Tennessee tomorrow to consider our  
options,'' said Mike Tuffin, Alexander's New Hampshire field 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the candidates was allotted a total of 13 minutes to  
address the crowd -- and for ``spontaneous'' demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Introduced amid a burst of fireworks, patriotic tunes and a  
spray of balloons, Forbes didn't mention Bush by name but took 
steady aim at the Texas governor. ``The power of these Washington 
elites won't be tamed, bent or broken by a candidate who relies on 
pollsters and tutors to tell him what he thinks,'' he told a 
capacity straw poll crowd numbering more than 24,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a higher road, Bush called his rivals ``fine candidates''  
and stuck to his standard speech -- delivered with little passion. 
``Together, we will prove that someone who is conservative and 
compassionate can win without sacrificing principles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's supporters declared that the victory solidifies his  
standing as the GOP front-runner. They suggested that the results 
should thin the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that, though this is not a scientific process and even  
though some demean it, you just have to take stock of where you are 
-- whether you can raise the money and whether you can continue,'' 
said Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, one of Bush's closest political 
allies. He was in Iowa to campaign for the Texas governor.

<HEADLINE> Auburn's Baird Plans To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Hal Baird, the winningest baseball coach in  
Auburn history, said Saturday he will retire after next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird, 49, who will start his 16th season next spring, said  
Auburn needed a younger coach and he needed to find another phase 
in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought for a long time that the effective shelf life for  
a coach in the Southeastern Conference probably maximizes itself at 
15 years,'' said Baird. ``It takes 365 days and 24 hours a day 
commitment to do the job that needs to be done here. I find myself 
less and less able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baird, who said he had decided several months ago to retire,  
thanked Auburn athletics director David Housel for giving the 
program a chance to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Baird has a record of 593-308 record in 15 seasons at Auburn.  
Before being hired at Auburn, he spent five seasons at East 
Carolina. His 20-year head coaching career record is 738-374. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Baird, the Tigers made eight NCAA Regional appearances and  
advanced to the College World Series in 1994 and 1997. Last season, 
Auburn hosted its first regional since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached eight players who went on to the major leagues,  
including Bo Jackson and Frank Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his proudest moments as Auburn's coach came in 1996 when  
the new Plainsman Park opened. A $3.7 million renovation turned one 
of the SEC's worst facilities into one named third best in the 
country by Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a time when Auburn didn't have the facilities to compare  
with the competition, he was winning championships,'' said Housel. 
``He has led Auburn baseball to a new plateau. He is one of 
Auburn's best men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Housel said there was no timetable to begin looking for a new  
coach. Baird's logical successor would be assistant head coach 
Steve Renfroe, a former Auburn player who has been on the coaching 
staff since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Report: Only 3 States Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Only Iowa, Nebraska and North Dakota  
have completely tested their computer systems and are ready to face 
the new year without fear of potentially dangerous Year 2000 
glitches, according to a federal report released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the states have only 139 days to guarantee  
reliability of their systems that run everything from law 
enforcement agencies to utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can predict what might, or might not, happen once the  
clock ticks past midnight this New Year's Eve,'' said Rep. Stephen 
Horn, R-Calif. ``The only certainty is that this Jan. 1 deadline 
cannot be extended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, was released at a congressional subcommittee 
hearing held in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	While all 50 states have some type of plan in place, most said  
they won't be fully ready until next month and 14 states said their 
deadline to have all systems tested isn't until October or later. 
</P>
<P>
	``States are facing an extremely busy next few months to get  
themselves ready,'' said Joel Willemssen, director of the U.S. 
Civil Agencies Information Systems. ``Important progress has been 
made, but much work remains to avoid disruption of critical 
services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem involves older computers that recognize only the  
last two digits of a year and could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 
rather than 2000. In some cases, that confusion could cause 
computers to malfunction or break down, potentially causing power 
outages, air transportation delays, delayed tax refunds, failed 
medical devices and other disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	While most states lag in preparedness, the Silicon Valley  
companies that are greatly responsible for the computer chips used 
in so many systems told the committee they are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have one of the best Y2K programs in our  
industry,'' said Hewlett-Packard Co. marketing manager Brad 
Whitworth. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitworth said HP, the world's second largest computer vendor,  
has spent three years and $250 million on internal efforts to avoid 
Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Corp. government affairs manager Richard Hall said that  
company's internal review, completed just 10 days ago, showed that 
100 percent of its critical applications are Year 2000 capable. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Intel's biggest concern is that public power, water,  
telecommunications and transportation could halt at some of its 
overseas facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also has been working with local and state agencies to  
make sure utilities and other services will be working at its Santa 
Clara, Calif., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has reason to worry, according to the GAO report.  
</P>
<P>
	Although California's periodic earthquakes already test many  
emergency systems, key computer systems that would be used in 
catastrophes have not been tested for Y2K problems, said the 
report.

	Iowa Poll Could Shape GOP Field  
</P>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Under carnival tents filled with free food and  
music, Republican presidential candidates courted Iowa voters today 
in an informal poll that could reshape the GOP field and solidify 
the standing of George W. Bush as front-runner. The Texas governor 
and eight other White House hopefuls poured millions of dollars 
into this initial caucus state to test their political operations. 
But Sen. John McCain of Arizona, called the non-binding poll a 
``sham'' and refused to go. A confidant Bush, speaking to 
supporters at a fishing hole outside Ames, introducing his wife 
Laura as ``the next first lady of the United States.''

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lane Kirkland, who reunited the major U.S.  
unions during his presidency of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, died 
today of lung cancer. He was 77. His wife Irena said Kirkland died 
at home nine months after being stricken. Kirkland oversaw a 
massive effort by American workers in the 1980s to sustain the 
Polish Solidarity movement. The AFL-CIO also reached out to workers 
in other countries where the trade union movement was suppressed, 
including South Africa, China, Cuba and Chile.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The latest from the cyberworld is an  
aspirin-size computer that, embedded in household appliances, could 
let people on the road or at the office use the Internet to cool 
their homes, heat coffee and tape TV shows. Believed to be the 
smallest such computer ever built, the inexpensive device could 
help usher in a new generation of connected home appliances from

	TOKYO (AP) -- Rivers swollen from heavy rains in central Japan  
swept away 30 people, forcing a massive search today that stretched 
into the late evening. Soldiers joined the search for 16 campers 
swept away by turbulent waters after authorities rescued 14 people, 
a police official said. Heavy rains swept across Tokyo and 
surrounding regions, raising water levels in rivers and prompting 
authorities to warn against flooding. Forecasters said seasonal 
monsoon rains are likely to continue for much of the month in 
Southeast Asia, raising fears of further flooding.

open casket of slain comic Jaime Garzon today as a nation in shock 
mourned the loss of its best-loved political satirist. Garzon, 38, 
was killed yesterday, shot as he drove to work at a Bogota radio 
station. The slaying stunned a country long numbed to political 
violence and raised fears that Colombia's civil conflict is 
spiraling out of control. Today's newspapers dedicated entire pages 
to the comic whose caustic wit often targeted the corruption and 
vanity of the rich and powerful.

Tennessee, the defending champs who knocked off Florida State in 
the Fiesta Bowl to complete a 13-0 season, is right behind at No.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Vote at GOP Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- It was a Republican straw poll Saturday, but  
that didn't deter Democrat Joe Shannahan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful day to watch conservative Republicans,'' said  
Shannahan, a former spokesman for the Iowa Democratic Party and a 
supporter of Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Shannahan said he planned to vote for the Republican candidate  
who would do the most damage to GOP front-runner George W. Bush, 
but that he didn't bring a large group with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't try to orchestrate anything,'' he said. ``That  
wouldn't be right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Parker, spokesman for Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack's last  
campaign, sported a Lamar Alexander button and headed for a polling 
place. ``Lamar's been my guy for a long time,'' he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they were serious about enforcing time limits  
on the presidential candidates, and they wasted no time 
demonstrating that resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Keyes was the first speaker, and he had the jammed coliseum  
rocking with his fiery oratory when he came to the time limit. GOP 
officials shut off the microphone, cutting off Keyes in 
mid-sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a smattering of boos from Keyes' backers and he stood  
frozen for a moment. His family quickly came on stage, and they all 
waved and walked off. 
</P>
<P>
	The party gave each of the nine candidates a total of 13 minutes  
to speak. Most planned a three-minute ``spontaneous'' 
demonstration, followed by a 10-minute speech. 
</P>
<P>
	State Republican officials have said they warned candidates in  
advance that the time limit would be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes started his appearance with a fireworks display and  
balloon drop. But the balloons might have backfired on him. Forbes' 
speech was punctuated throughout with the sound of the balloons 
popping in the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Not all those who came to Ames actually got inside the Hilton  
Coliseum to hear the candidate speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Roughly three hours before voting ended, officials began  
refusing access to the facility, saying it was filled to legal 
capacity. With the seating arrangement selected by Republicans, the 
building holds just under 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There were thousands of people still milling outside at that  
time, with some entertainment still going on. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of bikers were among those attending the straw poll.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not supporting anybody,'' said Paul Orton, of Eldora,  
better known as ``Taco.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orton drove in with the bike brigade headed by Colorado Sen. Ben  
Nighthorse Campbell, and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, as did Mark 
Maxwell, who had stronger opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very passionate people,'' said Maxwell. ``We get  
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell said he was voting for publisher Steve Forbes.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	There were plenty of athletes in Ames, too, showcased by the  
candidates they supported. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reggie White, a recently retired pro football star, had his  
own mission. He wanted the presidential candidates to sign a pledge 
to stamp out pornography. ``I'm trying to promote godly things,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Green Bay Packer at one time was a big backer of Gary  
Bauer, but insisted he wasn't supporting any candidate right now. 
</P>
<P>
	Orrin Hatch brought in NBA star Karl Malone, of the Utah Jazz,  
while Texas Gov. George W. Bush brought in former pro football star 
Roger Staubach and popular former University of Iowa football Coach 
Hayden Fry. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Some Death Row Inmates Exonerated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The condemned man sat shackled in the prison  
visiting room, listening to his lawyers talk about a way out -- one 
way left to prove his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Jones, convicted of the rape and murder of a young  
mother, insisted he hadn't done it. Now, after four years on death 
row, an improved DNA test might finally clear him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Cunningham, one of his lawyers, cautioned there would be no  
turning back. ``This is the whole ball game,'' he advised Jones. 
``If there's any chance you did this, it's going to prove it beyond 
a shadow of a doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was adamant.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want the testing done,'' he said. ``It's not me.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *12 EXECUTED, 12 FREED   	
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Jones was hardly the first death row inmate to protest  
his innocence. But what is striking, even shocking, in Illinois is 
how frequently such claims have turned out to be true. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last dozen years, while 12 men have been executed, 12  
others once condemned to die have been exonerated -- three this 
year. Some were cleared with new trials. Some had their convictions 
overturned in appeals. Some had DNA prove their innocence. And 
some, incredibly enough, had student journalists help set them 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	This statistic may be more dramatic than those in other states,  
but it mirrors a national trend. Since 1973, 81 men and one woman 
sentenced to death have been freed, nearly half of them since 1990, 
according to Richard Dieter, director of the Death Penalty 
Information Center in Washington. He believes more investigations 
by lawyers and journalists and increased use of DNA testing are 
partly responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrongful convictions are shifting the national debate over  
the death penalty. Traditionally, the argument has been over its 
morality. Now, the question is how often we condemn the innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine asked the  
state Supreme Court to delay the executions of three inmates who 
claim police coerced them into confessing. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Dieter says, lawmakers in at least 10 states proposed  
imposing a moratorium on executions or abolishing them. ``Illinois 
made temporarily halting the death penalty a legitimate issue,'' he 
says. ``The momentum has picked up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve wrongful convictions do not mean Illinois, with 158 death  
row inmates, has a bigger problem than other states, says Larry 
Marshall, a Northwestern University law professor who has been 
involved in 10 of the cases. But, he says, they do mean ``we're 
doing a better job of detecting them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, he says, the 12 could easily have gone to the death  
chamber. Their salvation depended on coincidence, good timing and 
good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider Gary Gauger, freed because his pleas for help happened  
to reach the right desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Darby Tillis and Perry Cobb, released because a stranger  
happened to read about their case in a legal newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Ronald Jones, saved from lethal injection because old DNA  
evidence, which often gets lost or destroyed, happened to be 
sitting in brown envelopes in a file drawer for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can call it luck,'' Marshall says. ``You can call it the  
hand of God. You can call it fortuity, serendipity. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it's not,'' he says, ``is the system working.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *A SIMPLE TEST   	
</P>
<P>
	The facts were stacked against Ronald Jones.  
</P>
<P>
	He was a homeless, alcoholic panhandler. His IQ was around 80.  
Worse, he had confessed to the 1985 murder of Debra Smith, though 
he later recanted, saying he made up a story so police would stop 
beating him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Cunningham and his co-counsel, Gary Prichard, studied the  
stacks of legal records for any mistakes, any issue that hadn't 
been rejected in earlier appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	There wasn't much. A bid to throw out the confession had failed.  
The detectives who interrogated Jones had no history of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was science.  
</P>
<P>
	A DNA test Jones took in 1989 had been inconclusive, but more  
precise methods of testing were now available. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors opposed the test, however, saying it essentially  
would be retrying the case. The trial judge agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``What issue could possibly be resolved by DNA testing?'' asked  
Cook County Circuit Judge John Morrissey. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, after all, had signed a statement saying he had offered  
Miss Smith $10 to have sex, they had intercourse in an abandoned 
motel, and when he refused to pay her, she pulled a knife. They 
struggled and he stabbed her. Sure, he recanted at the trial, but 
why should anyone believe him now? 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' lawyers insisted the confession didn't fit the crime.  
There was no evidence Miss Smith, a 28-year-old mother of three, 
was a prostitute. Jones had a burglary and robbery record, but no 
history of soliciting prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	A DNA test, the defense argued, could prove conclusively whether  
the semen recovered from the victim belonged to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Save arguments like that for the press,'' the judge said.  
``They love it. I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in 1997, after more than two years of arguments, the  
Illinois Supreme Court granted permission for DNA testing. Ronald 
Jones' fate rested in a few envelopes stashed in a file cabinet in 
the court clerk's office. The evidence was shipped to a forensic 
expert in California, who first made sure there was enough material 
to analyze. There was. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks later, Cunningham had his answer. He phoned Jones.  
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Are you sitting down?' '' he recalls.  
</P>
<P>
	The DNA testing had excluded Jones.  
</P>
<P>
	His life was spared, but his freedom proved elusive.  
</P>
<P>
	A computer check found that years ago Jones, now 50, had walked  
away from a work release camp in Tennessee, where he had been 
serving five years for robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon he was behind bars again, this time in Tennessee.  
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham's work goes on. He has nine more clients on death  
row. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *BUYING TIME   	
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, a condemned man spends an average 13 years awaiting  
execution. That time helped save 12 men. Investigators unearthed 
new evidence. Witnesses changed their stories. DNA testing became 
more sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no DNA case in Illinois more shocking than the  
Ford Heights Four in which two men were sentenced to death and two 
others to virtual life in prison for a gang rape and double murder. 
</P>
<P>
	They spent up to 18 years behind bars before DNA tests  
exonerated them in 1996. At that time, three other men confessed to 
the crime. The Ford Heights Four recently won a $36 million 
settlement from the county. 
</P>
<P>
	None of this would have happened without David Protess, a  
Northwestern journalism professor, and some of his students, whose 
investigation led the state's chief witness to change his story. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the case, Illinois passed a law giving death row  
inmates a right to DNA testing in cases where identity is an issue 
and test results could potentially prove innocence. Its sponsor was 
Ed Petka, a state senator and former prosecutor who put seven men 
on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an idea whose time has come,'' he says. ``I can't see  
anyone who should be objecting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But only New York and Illinois have such laws. In 33 states, new  
evidence can't be introduced in a criminal case more than six 
months after the final judgment in state court, says Barry Scheck, 
co-director of the Innocence Project at the Cardozo School of Law 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA testing has exonerated 64 inmates in the United States and  
Canada, including nine who were on death row in this country, 
Scheck says. In cases the Innocence Project handled, more than 
two-thirds tested had results in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 70 percent of the cases in which inmates asked for help,  
Scheck says, evidence that would help determine innocence is 
claimed to be lost or destroyed, though sometimes it turns up 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when there is evidence, the wrongly convicted need  
something else: a champion. That's been true in all the Illinois 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are alive ... for the most part because they've  
been lucky enough to find somebody in their family or somebody in 
their community who's willing to fight for them,'' Marshall says. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what saved Gary Gauger.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *A CONFESSION?   	
</P>
<P>
	Gary Gauger's own words helped put him on death row.  
</P>
<P>
	His twin sister's persistence helped set him free.  
</P>
<P>
	Gauger, now 47, was convicted of the 1993 murders of his  
parents, Morris and Ruth, on their farm in Richmond, Ill. When 
their throats were slashed, he says he was sleeping; the crime 
scene was 26 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign of robbery; dozens of guns and thousands of  
dollars were left in the house. There was no forced entry. And 
there were no eyewitnesses or physical evidence to tie Gauger to 
the crime, though he says police told him they had a weapon and 
bloody fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked them if they could lie,'' he recalls. ``They said, no,  
they would lose their jobs. And I'm believing them. ... I was 
naive. My parents had been killed. I wanted to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gauger was questioned nonstop for 18 hours without a lawyer; the  
interrogation was not recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	McHenry County sheriff's police were immediately suspicious of  
the ponytailed, organic farmer who appeared strangely mellow for a 
grief-stricken son, tending to his tomato plants as investigators 
scoured the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	But what doomed Gauger were his statements.  
</P>
<P>
	He says late in the interrogation police asked him to  
hypothetically describe how he might have slashed his parents' 
throats. And he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Gauger blurted out that he had killed his parents.  
</P>
<P>
	Gauger says he was so exhausted he began thinking he might have  
done so in a blackout, even saying it at one point but then 
repeatedly insisting he didn't believe he had committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought as soon as somebody impartial looks at this, they'll  
see what a sham it is,'' he now says. He was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Before sentencing, his twin, Ginger Gauger-Blossom, defiantly  
told the court the murderer was still at large. She also spoke of 
her regret that her parents' desire for her brother to someday take 
over the farm would never be realized. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosecution and a misguided attempt at justice has destroyed  
their dream,'' she said. ``All of my dreams are gone also, with the 
exception of one: That the truth comes out and Gary is released.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Determined to make that happen, she mailed scores of letters to  
TV magazine shows, begging them to investigate. She urged her 
brother to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would scream at him,'' she recalls, ``I'd say, 'Gary, you  
can't give up!' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Their pleas were finally answered when Larry Marshall took the  
case, and won his freedom in 1996. Gauger spent 3 1/2 years in prison, 
including nine months on death row. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, there was a startling epilogue. A member of the  
Outlaws motorcycle gang described in court how he and an accomplice 
killed the couple in a robbery, making off with $15 to buy 
breakfast. He also testified that a wound on Mrs. Gauger's head 
linked to her son's knife at trial was, in fact, a mark from the 
butt of one of the killer's guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Gauger is planning a civil suit, but Jim Sotos, a lawyer hired  
to represent the police, says there was no police misconduct. As 
for Gauger, he says: ``I don't think he was treated unfairly at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
 *WARNING SIGNS   	
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood likes to portray the wronged man as a Jimmy  
Stewart-like good guy caught in a Hitchcock-like web of 
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	In real life the accused usually aren't so saintly.  
</P>
<P>
	About half the defendants in the 12 Illinois death-row cases had  
already been in trouble with the law, Marshall says. In most 
wrongful conviction cases, he added, the accused are members of 
minority groups or have personality quirks that arouse suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Another recurring problem, he says, is the defendants are often  
represented by lawyers who are overworked, over their heads or 
underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall lists several warning signs common to wrongful  
convictions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Confessions in which the suspect parrots police assertions and  
provides no details of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reliance on testimony of jailhouse snitches, who are  
notoriously unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
	--Single witnesses, who are frequently believed by juries but are  
frequently wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	One inmate released from death row in February had been  
convicted largely on the basis of an eyewitness who was wrong about 
many facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
	But ferreting out the truth can be difficult.  
</P>
<P>
	Consider Anthony Porter, who once was two days away from  
execution during his 17 years in prison for a double murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall helped craft an appeal last year based on Porter's IQ  
of 51, not on his persistent claims of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, last winter, Protess, the Northwestern journalism  
professor, came to the rescue again. His students and an 
investigator gathered evidence that showed Porter had been wrongly 
convicted. As a result of their work, key witnesses recanted their 
testimony and a Milwaukee man videotaped a confession to the 
murders after his estranged wife identified him as the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter is now a free man, but, at 44, he has no job or money. He  
lives with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FIVE TRIALS, TWO WITNESSES   	
</P>
<P>
	The fates of Darby Tillis and Perry Cobb turned on two people.  
</P>
<P>
	The first was the government's key witness who claimed she drove  
the getaway car the night they robbed and murdered two people at a 
hot dog stand in 1977. Her testimony sent them to death row. 
</P>
<P>
	The second was a stranger to Tillis and Cobb, a young lawyer who  
happened to read about their case and came forward with startling 
news. His testimony cleared them. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillis and Cobb were tried five times. Three trials ended with  
hung juries and a fourth brought the death penalty, which was 
thrown out on appeal. Finally, after spending nine years behind 
bars, about half of them on death row, the men were acquitted in 
their only non-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Their case, perhaps more than any, illustrates how a single  
stroke of luck can free condemned men. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors built their case around two witnesses -- the woman  
who said she drove the getaway car and a bartender who was 75 feet 
from the place where the murders occurred. At the first trial, he 
said he saw two men for five seconds and couldn't identify them. At 
the third trial, he made a positive identification. 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point came when Michael Falconer read a story in the  
Chicago Lawyer about the case. Falconer recognized the name of the 
government's star witness; he'd worked with her years earlier at a 
factory job. 
</P>
<P>
	He remembered she once told him she and her boyfriend -- the same  
man she testified she had dropped off before the crime was 
committed -- had planned to rob a restaurant but that something went 
wrong and someone was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he testified, Falconer was a Lake County prosecutor.  
A prosecutor testifying for the defense in a high-profile murder 
case was not a popular move. But he did. 
</P>
<P>
	At the final trial in 1987, Judge Thomas Hett said he believed  
the state's witness was a liar and Falconer was telling the truth. 
But Hett's acquittal fell short of proclaiming their innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is evidence pointing to the defendants' guilt,'' he  
said, ``but there is just as much evidence discrediting a large 
part of such incriminating evidence. As much as I do not want to 
say these words, I must. The defendants are not guilty of all 
charges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The murders remain unsolved.  
</P>
<P>
	But 22 years later, Tillis and Cobb still are trying to clear  
their names. In July, they made an appeal to a state board, seeking 
a pardon from the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've been branded for life,'' Tillis, 55, told the  
board. ``I feel that the system has something they owe me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 57, Cobb says he has been unable to get his life back on  
track. ``All these days I have been off death row,'' he says, 
``death row has not been off me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	No new execution dates have been set in Illinois, but the clock  
is running. 
</P>
<P>
	Each week, letters from death row, about half from Illinois,  
arrive in Larry Marshall's office. He says he turns down 99 percent 
of the pleas for help because he doesn't have enough resources. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall is confident more death-row death row inmates will walk  
free, but when it comes to deciding which case to investigate, he 
is less certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we hope for,'' he says, ``is God's help to guide our hand  
to take the right one.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Iowa Poll Could Shape GOP Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Under carnival tents filled with free food and  
music, Republican presidential candidates courted Iowa voters 
Saturday in an informal poll that could reshape the GOP field. 
George W. Bush sought to solidify his front-runner status, but 
publisher Steve Forbes mounted a significant challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, Forbes and seven other White House hopefuls poured  
millions of dollars and spent hundreds of hours in this initial 
caucus state to test the potency of their political operations. One 
candidate, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, called the nonbinding poll 
a ``sham'' and refused to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Introduced amid a burst of fireworks, patriotic tunes and a  
spray of balloons, Forbes didn't mention Bush name but took steady 
aim at the Texas governor. ``The power of these Washington elites 
won't be tamed, bent or broken by a candidate who relies on 
pollsters and tutors to tell him what he thinks,'' he told a 
capacity crowd that heard each candidate speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a higher road, Bush called his rivals ``fine candidates''  
and stuck to his standard speech -- delivered with little passion. 
``Together, we will prove that someone who is conservative and 
compassionate can win without sacrificing principles,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole and Lamar Alexander needed strong showings to  
remain viable as potential alternatives to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Television commentator Pat Buchanan, Washington activist Gary  
Bauer, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, radio broadcaster Alan Keyes and 
former Vice President Dan Quayle struggled to emerge as the 
strongest social conservative candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Four hours before the voting concluded, Bush aides said they had  
purchased 10,500 ballots and distributed all but 500 of them to 
supporters. Forbes officials had purchased 7,711 tickets, handing 
out all but 320. 
</P>
<P>
	But the aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had no way  
of knowing before the ballots were counted if supporters had 
actually taken the time to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' aides had urged his supporters to vote early, before  
herds of voters jammed polling stations. Bush's aides didn't -- and 
found many of their backers locked outside the main building after 
listening to a late-running music show. They scoured the grounds 
with bullhorns urging Bush backers to vote at alternative sites -- 
and not to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers shut the doors to the Hilton Coliseum, because it was  
at its capacity of 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no straw poll winner ever has won the GOP nomination, the  
contest has helped and hurt any number of candidacies ahead of the 
first real votes, the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sought a convincing victory to further distance himself  
from the pack with time running out on his rivals. He competed at 
the risk of tarnishing his image as the GOP's best vote-getter, the 
man most likely to win a general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes hoped to prove that he could convert his money, message  
and tireless work into an impressive number of votes. If he could 
not do it in a money-driven straw poll, questions were certain to 
be asked about his prospects down the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander needed to finish in the first four places to avoid  
dropping out of his second presidential race, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole draws huge crowds stocked with young and professional  
women. The poll was a test of whether they were serious political 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer scoured a network of churches and plumbed his contacts in  
the home-schooling community. He was the candidate that worried the 
other campaigns the most, because his support was hard to gauge. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan taunted the GOP establishment with insurgent campaigns  
in 1992 and 1996. He needed a strong showing to energize his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes is not a threat to win the nomination, but did well in the  
last straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, a late-entry to the field, looked for a jump start from  
the poll.	   Quayle set his expectations low for Saturday, but knew that 
finishing behind lesser-known conservatives would cause political 
trouble.

<HEADLINE> Kenny Irwin Loses his Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) -- The talk finally caught up with Kenny  
Irwin, who races as a lame duck Sunday in the Frontier at the Glen. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight months after he won Winston Cup Rookie of the Year honors,  
the rumor that had been floating around NASCAR for months became 
reality. Irwin lost his ride in the famed No. 28 car of Robert 
Yates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a talk on Wednesday,'' he said after wrecking his car  
during practice Friday at Watkins Glen International. ``At first, 
it was a little loud. But when it was over, I actually felt pretty 
good about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yates, who said, ``At first, you could hear us on the other side  
of the track,'' had hoped Irwin's performance would give him a 
strong car to team with that of runaway series points leader Dale 
Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants this 28 team to run as good as the 88,'' Irwin said.  
``I couldn't come up with it. I don't think there was just one 
thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision appeared to involve a lack of communication in a  
sport in which communication is paramount for success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame that it had to wait this long,'' Yates said. ``I  
wish we had done that early on because we probably wouldn't be 
doing what we're doing now. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very tough decision, and it's really about we,  
together, all of us, didn't perform. We needed to do something 
different. It's so tough to try to get that next deal when you're 
really not sure that you want to get rid of this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Irwin who initiated what turned into a sometimes heated  
six-hour conversation with Yates about his ride in the car, which 
over the years has been driven by Hall of Famers Davey and Bobby 
Allison, Benny Parsons, Buddy Baker, and Cale Yarborough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably tried to get an answer out of him earlier than he  
wanted,'' said Irwin, who began the year by finishing third in the 
Daytona 500 but has had just one top-10 since and ranks 20th in the 
driver standings. ``But I needed to know. I needed it to be public. 
It seems like this talk has been going on since 1997.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin displayed unusual promise as soon as he buckled up for the  
first time in a Winston Cup car. In his first race, in September 
1997 in Richmond, Va., he qualified a Ford on the outside of the 
front row, led a dozen laps and finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	In doing so, he became the only driver in NASCAR's modern era  
(since 1972) to start on the front row and finish in the top 10 in 
his first race. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin continued to shine when he got behind the wheel of the car  
in 1998, his rookie season. His best success last year came at 
Atlanta Motor Speedway, where he finished fifth in the March race 
and led the most laps. He also won one pole and had four top-10s. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin said he's had some feelers already for a new ride but  
doesn't plan to rush into anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you feel good that you have some options,'' he said.  
``Robert gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. He gave me the 
opportunity to do something, and I'm very grateful for it. Winston 
Cup is the only place I want to be.''

<HEADLINE> Rodriguez Steals and Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ivan Rodriguez became the first catcher in major  
league history to hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases in the same 
season Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez picked up his 20th steal of the season following a  
leadoff single in the third inning. He swiped second base against 
Chicago White Sox pitcher Jim Parque and catcher Brook Fordyce. 
Rodriguez's previous season-high for stolen bases was nine in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, 27, leads all American League catchers with 24 home  
runs, his third straight 20-homer season and the most ever by a 
Rangers catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	He is just the third catcher in AL history to reach 20 steals.  
The others to do so are Kansas City's John Wathan in 1982 when he 
stole a major league record 36, and in 1983 (28 steals) and the 
White Sox's Ray Schalk who stole 30 bases in 1916 and 24 in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest any catcher has come to a 20-20 season was in 1987  
when San Diego's Benito Santiago hit 18 homers and stole 21 bases.

<HEADLINE> 2 Accused of Drug Sale Over Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Two men have been charged with using the Internet  
to sell ingredients and easy-to-follow instructions for making a 
powerful ``date-rape'' drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Gorton, 63, of Merritt Island, Fla., and John Hedrick, 22,  
of Colorado Springs, Colo., have been charged in Michigan with one 
count each of solicitation to manufacture a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were charged after state agents went to their Web site  
and purchased the materials needed to make GHB, Michigan Attorney 
General Jennifer Granholm said. 
</P>
<P>
	The site was sponsored by Gorton's business, Centurion Aging  
Research Laboratory, or CARL. It included an order form that 
directed customers to send cash or money orders to a post office 
box registered to Hedrick. 
</P>
<P>
	GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, is often called a date-rape drug  
because a person who drinks a beverage laced with a few drops can 
lose consciousness within 20 minutes and the next morning have no 
memory of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Granholm said the instructions that came with the ``G-WiZzZzZ''  
kits were so easy ``a third-grader could have put them together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Drug dealers who move their operations off the street corner  
and onto the Internet should know that they're not welcome in the 
state,'' Granholm said. 
</P>
<P>
	The site, which has since been taken down, said CARL offered  
people the chance to ``enjoy the incredible benefits of using 
GHB,'' according to Granholm. 
</P>
<P>
	Three kits were ordered June 29 for $200 each and arrived at  
Michigan post office boxes in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Each kit included GBL, potassium and ``step-by-step instructions  
that you can do at your kitchen counter,'' Granholm said. 
</P>
<P>
	GBL, or gamma-butyrolactone, is a substance readily available in  
such products as paint thinners or as a dietary supplement. GBL 
metabolizes into GHB after it's ingested. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedrick has been arrested but Gorton has not yet been taken into  
custody. The two likely will be extradited to Michigan to face the 
charges, Granholm said. 
</P>
<P>
	They each face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	Since 1990, at least 32 deaths and more than 3,500 overdoses  
have been linked to GHB nationwide, according to the Drug 
Enforcement Administration.

<HEADLINE> Hale Irwin Out of Contention at PGA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Hale Irwin's fountain-of-youth run at the  
PGA Championship ended Saturday. Don't blame age. Fifty-four years 
didn't have nearly as much to do with his 6-over-par 78 as his 
faulty putter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might as well have worn my hat backwards. I couldn't tell  
you if I was putting with a 2-iron or a wedge or a driver or 
putter,'' a discouraged Irwin said after falling 12 shots behind 
co-leaders Tiger Woods and Mike Weir with a round left to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feel today was just not there. You have those days,  
unfortunately. The last two days I didn't putt great, but I managed 
things well. Today the hitting was off and the putting was off and 
you can't do that on this course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin should know something about Medinah. It holds one of his  
fondest memories, the place where he won the 1990 U.S. Open on the 
19th playoff hole. 
</P>
<P>
	For two days, Irwin, who has 24 senior tour wins, was showing  
the younger guys how to do it. He was 5 under with his steady play 
and just four shots back. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the 78.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you shoot 78 anywhere, particularly in the position I  
was in, you're disappointed,'' Irwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shooting 78 is not what we're here for.''  
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, the oldest player in the tournament, had seven bogeys,  
including three over the first eight holes, and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I three-putted at the very beginning and then missed  
successive birdie putts and before you know, I'm struggling,'' he 
said. ``I missed too many fairways and it just got worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little bit of the balloon got deflated early, and I just  
couldn't get it back together. It simply was not a very good round 
of golf at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin's frustration was visible, but he was quick to point out  
that it was disappointment and not so much anger. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're hopeful to play well and you don't. But composure was  
not the problem. It was purely hitting the ball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before heading out to greet a long line of autograph  
seekers off the 18th green, Irwin turned philosophical about his 
return to Medinah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've still got one more day and that's more than some guys,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been fun. Today was disappointing. But it's still been  
great. I wouldn't trade it.''

<HEADLINE> Women's Basketball Team Adds Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. women's national basketball team  
added five players today, making a 10-member squad that faces a 
nonstop year of basketball in preparation for the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Cynthia Cooper, Chamique Holdsclaw, Yolanda  
Griffith, Natalie Williams and DeLisha Milton was announced at a 
news conference at the MCI Center. USA Basketball officials had 
confirmed their selections earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The five join five ``core'' national team players who were named  
last year: Lisa Leslie, Nikki McCray, Katie Smith, Dawn Staley and 
Ruthie Bolton-Holifield. Two more players will be added early next 
year to complete the 12-player Olympic roster. 
</P>
<P>
	All 10 play in the WNBA. Following the WNBA season, they will  
gather in San Diego on Sept. 7 for the U.S. Olympic Cup tournament, 
followed by the USA Basketball International Tournament in Palo 
Alto, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will stay together through most of the fall and winter,  
playing a 12-game college exhibition tour and games against various 
international teams before the WNBA training camps open in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will reassemble in August, leaving little time before  
the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, which begin Sept. 16, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's tough,'' said McCray, a member of the Olympic  
team that won the gold medal in Atlanta. ``But when you've played 
in the Olympics and you know what it feels like to win a gold 
medal, you're willing to make a sacrifice and do whatever it takes 
to get to that level again.''

<HEADLINE> Family Mourns Man Slain in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITTIER, Calif. (AP) -- Postal workers in uniform were among the  
hundreds of friends and family who packed a chapel for the funeral 
of a Filipino American mail carrier allegedly slain by a white 
supremacist, a man lauded by a notorious racist leader as a ``good 
soldier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners gathered to remember Joseph Ileto, 39, and listened to  
stories from family members about his love of baseball and chess. 
Buford O. Furrow, 37, is jailed in connection with Illeto's slaying 
and the wounding of five people at a Jewish community center during 
Tuesday's bloody rampage through the San Fernando Valley, 
</P>
<P>
	``Los Angeles is the most diverse city in the most diverse  
country in the history of the world. And history is watching us,'' 
said U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat whose district includes the 
post office Ileto was working from when he was killed. ``A criminal 
came to Los Angeles with hate in his heart, enough hate for all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Democratic Sens.  
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer all offered their condolences to 
the family in statements read by Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
	Music from a solo bagpipe player floated into the entryway of  
the chapel as guests carrying balloons and flowers filed past 
posterboards displaying photos of Ileto from throughout his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a friend, a good worker, we miss him so much,'' said  
Minh Ky, 47, a mail carrier, said of Ileto. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, Furrow was lauded in a newspaper report by  
Richard Butler, the head of the Idaho-based Aryan Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a good soldier,'' Butler was quoted as saying in  
Saturday's New York Post. ``He was very respected among us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 81-year-old Butler also said, ``I don't know why he did what  
he did, but I cannot condemn what he did -- nor do I condone it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left Saturday for Butler by The Associated  
Press with Aryan Nations members and an answering machine at his 
Hayden Lake, Idaho, compound were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow is accused of shooting Ileto nine times, several in the  
back of his head. He allegedly told investigators that the postal 
worker was a good ``target of opportunity'' to kill because he was 
of Filipino descent and worked for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Just prior to killing Ileto, Furrow had allegedly opened fire at  
the North Valley Jewish Community Center, injuring five people. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow reportedly chose the Jewish community center as a target  
at random after stumbling onto it during a stop for gas off the 
freeway. He is suspected of considering other more prominent Jewish 
facilities, but was deterred by heavy security there. 
</P>
<P>
	Months before a Furrow was accused of firing on a Jewish center  
and killing a postal worker here, he was ordered by a judge in 
Washington to give up his guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to a report in Saturday's Los Angeles Times,  
Furrow's probation officer never checked to see if he complied with 
the judge's order, and did not make recommended visits to his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Saturday's Times, Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks  
called for nationwide ban on assault rifles and small handguns 
known as Saturday night specials. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, only one shooting victim remained hospitalized  
Saturday. Five-year-old Benjamin Kadish's condition improved from 
critical to serious at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, said 
spokesman Steve Rutledge.

<HEADLINE>  Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Pee Wee Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop  
and Brooklyn Dodgers captain whose leadership and example helped 
ease the way for Jackie Robinson to break baseball's color barrier, 
died Saturday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese died at his home in Louisville, said Lori Young of the  
Pearson Funeral Home. The cause of death was not given. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese, who overcame prostate cancer years ago, underwent  
radiation treatment for lung cancer in March 1997 after doctors 
removed a malignant tumor. He also was recovering from a broken hip 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags at Dodger Stadium were flown at half-staff for Saturday  
night's game against Atlanta. A moment of silence was observed and 
a one-minute highlight film of Reese's career was shown on the 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-time All-Star, Reese sparked the Dodgers to seven  
National League pennants. He led Brooklyn to its only World Series 
championship in 1955, fielding the final ball in a 2-0 victory in 
Game 7 at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese was inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 1984. A  
regular at the induction ceremonies at Cooperstown, N.Y., until 
recent years, he was not at the shrine three weeks ago for the 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pee Wee was one of the guys on the Dodgers who we -- I mean the  
black guys -- could look to for leadership,'' said pitcher Don 
Newcombe, who played eight years with Reese. ``Jackie would tell us 
who the nice guys were and who wasn't. And Pee Wee was surely one 
of the nice guys -- one you could trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his calm leadership, sure-handed fielding and clutch  
hits, Reese played a key role in easing Robinson's road into the 
majors in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	During one particularly tough time when the abuse was getting  
ugly at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, Reese walked over to Robinson 
and put his arm over the rookie's shoulder, a show of unity from a 
white to a black that spoke volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a big picture of it, both of us laughing, hanging in  
my den,'' Reese said a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That moment is cited as a turning point in Robinson's  
transition. Later, Reese and Robinson would play golf and tennis 
together on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 1972 book ``The Boys of Summer,'' author Roger Kahn  
hailed Reese as a ``catalyst of baseball integration'' for his 
friendship with Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese recalled that after hearing the Dodger organization had  
hired a black player, he thought, ``If he's man enough to take my 
job, I'm not gonna like it, but, dammit, black or white, he 
deserves it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There were times when I went over to talk to him on the field,  
thinking that people would see this and figure we were friends and 
this would help Jack,'' Reese told Kahn. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime Dodger broadcaster Vin Scully recalled that day at  
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a message sent to one and all that a boy from the  
South puts his arms around a black man and says, `Hey, we're equal, 
we're teammates, and we're in this thing together.' And that was 
typical of Pee Wee,'' Scully said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the heart and soul of the `Boys of Summer.' If a player  
needed to be consoled, Pee Wee would console him. If a player 
needed to be kicked in the fanny, Pee Wee would do that, too. If a 
player really needed a friend, Pee Wee was there for him,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harold Henry Reese was born on July 23, 1918, on a farm in  
Ekron, Ky., and moved to Louisville with his family as a child. As 
a boy, he once was runner-up to the national champion in The 
Courier-Journal marble tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he gained the nickname of Pee Wee not because of his  
size -- he was listed at 5-foot-10 and 160 pounds -- but from his 
youthful prowess at marbles. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese was first signed by the Louisville Colonels of the  
American Association in 1937. ``The Little Colonel,'' as he was 
called, batted .269 in a career that spanned 1940-58 and included 
the Dodgers' first year in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	But his offensive career totals -- 126 home runs, 885 RBIs -- did  
not begin to measure his value to the Dodgers, or to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have heard the expression about several former Dodgers that  
this one or that one was the greatest Dodger who ever lived,'' 
former teammate and fellow Hall of Famer Duke Snider said. ``In my 
estimation, Pee Wee Reese was the greatest Dodger whoever lived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, a group that included Boston Red Sox owner Tom  
Yawkey purchased the Colonels for $195,000, largely because it 
wanted Reese's contract. Later that year, the club sold Reese to 
the Dodgers for the equivalent of $75,000 ($35,000 in cash and four 
players). 
</P>
<P>
	Reese broke into the major leagues in 1940 and displaced Dodgers  
regular Leo Durocher, beginning a 16-year tenure at shortstop 
interrupted by a three-year stint in the Navy during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the NL in stolen bases with 30 in 1952 and in runs scored  
with 132 in 1947. Reese also topped the league in double plays four 
times and in fielding average (.977 in 1949). 
</P>
<P>
	After his baseball career, Reese worked as a broadcaster with  
CBS, NBC and the Cincinnati Reds. He later became director of the 
college and professional baseball staff at Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, 
maker of Louisville Slugger bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese married Dorothy Walton on March 29, 1942. They had two  
children, Barbara and Mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were not to be finalized until Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Teen Idol Garrett Goes for Rehab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former teen idol Leif Garrett pleaded guilty  
to drug possession to get into a rehabilitation program that could 
wipe his criminal record clean. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett, 37, will serve no jail time if he successfully  
completes the program, and the conviction will be cleared from his 
record. He completed a similar program after a 1997 arrest for 
cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The former child actor and 1970s singing sensation was among  
several people arrested June 29 in a sting at an apartment. He 
entered his plea Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett recently finished work on a film called ``Art of the  
Bullet.'' His earlier acting roles include the TV shows ``The 
FBI,'' and ``Gunsmoke.''

<HEADLINE> Family Mourns Man Slain in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITTIER, Calif. (AP) -- Postal workers in uniform were among the  
hundreds of friends and family who packed a chapel for the funeral 
of a Filipino American mail carrier allegedly slain by a white 
supremacist, a man lauded by a notorious racist leader as a ``good 
soldier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners gathered to remember Joseph Ileto, 39, and listened to  
stories from family members about his love of baseball and chess. 
Buford O. Furrow, 37, is jailed in connection with Illeto's slaying 
and the wounding of five people at a Jewish community center during 
Tuesday's bloody rampage through the San Fernando Valley, 
</P>
<P>
	``Los Angeles is the most diverse city in the most diverse  
country in the history of the world. And history is watching us,'' 
said U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat whose district includes the 
post office Ileto was working from when he was killed. ``A criminal 
came to Los Angeles with hate in his heart, enough hate for all of 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Democratic Sens.  
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer all offered their condolences to 
the family in statements read by Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
	Music from a solo bagpipe player floated into the entryway of  
the chapel as guests carrying balloons and flowers filed past 
posterboards displaying photos of Ileto from throughout his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a friend, a good worker, we miss him so much,'' said  
Minh Ky, 47, a mail carrier, said of Ileto. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, Furrow was lauded in a newspaper report by  
Richard Butler, the head of the Idaho-based Aryan Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a good soldier,'' Butler was quoted as saying in  
Saturday's New York Post. ``He was very respected among us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 81-year-old Butler also said, ``I don't know why he did what  
he did, but I cannot condemn what he did -- nor do I condone it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left Saturday for Butler by The Associated  
Press with Aryan Nations members and an answering machine at his 
Hayden Lake, Idaho, compound were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow is accused of shooting Ileto nine times, several in the  
back of his head. He allegedly told investigators that the postal 
worker was a good ``target of opportunity'' to kill because he was 
of Filipino descent and worked for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Just prior to killing Ileto, Furrow had allegedly opened fire at  
the North Valley Jewish Community Center, injuring five people. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow reportedly chose the Jewish community center as a target  
at random after stumbling onto it during a stop for gas off the 
freeway. He is suspected of considering other more prominent Jewish 
facilities, but was deterred by heavy security there. 
</P>
<P>
	Months before a Furrow was accused of firing on a Jewish center  
and killing a postal worker here, he was ordered by a judge in 
Washington to give up his guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to a report in Saturday's Los Angeles Times,  
Furrow's probation officer never checked to see if he complied with 
the judge's order, and did not make recommended visits to his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Saturday's Times, Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks  
called for nationwide ban on assault rifles and small handguns 
known as Saturday night specials. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, only one shooting victim remained hospitalized  
Saturday. Five-year-old Benjamin Kadish's condition improved from 
critical to serious at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, said 
spokesman Steve Rutledge.

<HEADLINE>  Bush Wins Iowa Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush cemented his front-runner  
status Saturday night with a convincing victory in the Iowa straw 
poll, passing an early test of political potency that could unravel 
other Republican presidential campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole finished a close second and  
third. Weak showings by former Vice President Dan Quayle and Lamar 
Alexander staggered their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, is almost certain to  
drop out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of nine White House hopefuls poured millions of dollars  
and spent hundreds of hours in this initial caucus state to test 
their political strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``This victory today in Iowa put me on the road to winning the  
nomination of the Republican Party,'' declared Bush, who was 
criticized by nearly every one of his rivals in their addresses 
earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who had hoped for better results, found a measure of  
solace in ``the fact that two-thirds of the voters did not vote 
for'' Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no straw poll winner ever has won the GOP nomination, the  
contest has helped and hurt any number of candidacies ahead of the 
first real votes of the campaign season, the Iowa caucuses and the 
New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Introduced amid a burst of fireworks, patriotic tunes and a  
spray of balloons, Forbes didn't mention Bush by name but took 
steady aim at the Texas governor. ``The power of these Washington 
elites won't be tamed, bent or broken by a candidate who relies on 
pollsters and tutors to tell him what he thinks,'' he told a 
capacity straw poll crowd numbering more than 24,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a higher road, Bush called his rivals ``fine candidates''  
and stuck to his standard speech -- delivered with little passion. 
``Together, we will prove that someone who is conservative and 
compassionate can win without sacrificing principles,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush received nearly one third of the vote, or 7,418.  
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' second-place finish was solid but somewhat  
disappointing. Having outspent the entire field, the millionaire 
conservative had hoped to show his money and message made him a 
serious vote-getter. He earned 4,921 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, former president of the American Red Cross, had  
3,410 -- a solid showing for a first-time presidential candidate 
trying to expand the party's base to include more young and 
professional women. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, with 1,428 votes, and Quayle, with 816 votes and an  
eighth-place finish, were the night's biggest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle has said the straw poll would not end his presidential  
quest, but his finish behind three other conservative contenders -- 
Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan and Alan Keyes -- could dry up his 
fund-raising sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush supporters declared that the victory solidifies his  
standing as the GOP front-runner. They suggested that the results 
should thin the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that, though this is not a scientific process and even  
though some demean it, you just have to take stock of where you are 
-- whether you can raise the money and whether you can continue,'' 
said Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, one of Bush's closest political 
allies. He was in Iowa to campaign for the Texas governor.

<HEADLINE> Seven Injured in Ga. Plant Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) -- Seven workers were injured Saturday at a  
Georgia Power coal-burning plant when a chemical they were using to 
clean equipment ignited with coal dust, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the injured were in critical condition, and at least one  
suffered third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body. One victim 
was taken by helicopter to a burn center in Atlanta, while the 
others were transported by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion happened at about 1 p.m. at Plant McDonough,  
northwest of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently what they were cleaning with flashed and it ignited  
some coal dust and exploded,'' Cobb County Fired Department 
spokesman Stephen Mize said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extent of the damages was not immediately clear.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Starring in ``The Blair Witch Project'' hasn't  
ruined camping out for experience for Heather Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent film that has become a mainstream summer hit  
tells the story of young filmmakers who hike into the wilderness to 
document tales of a mythic witch haunting the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've actually become a very active camper,'' Donahue says in  
Aug. 20-22 issue of USA Weekend magazine, ``which surprises people, 
because they get so scared watching the movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue was one of three unknown actors now enjoying the  
unexpected box office success of the movie shot by two student 
filmmakers for about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	She has some advice for those venturing into the woods so they  
don't end up like the characters in ``The Blair Witch Project.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Tax Plan Hurts Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The GOP's $792 billion tax cut would reverse a  
quarter century of environmental progress, cutting pollution 
controls, stalling toxic waste cleanups, ``even shutting down 
national parks,'' President Clinton contended Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican budget plan ``would actually threaten our  
environment,'' Clinton said in his weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the spending proposal ``isn't simply turning back the  
clock on environmental protection. It's also turning its back on 
six years of fiscal responsibility and prudent investment -- a 
policy that's produced the strongest economy in a generation ... 
the largest surplus in our history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has promised to veto the package once Congress sends it  
to him after its August recess. He favors a budget plan that would 
strengthen the Social Security and Medicare systems and start 
paying off the national debt while permitting new investments in 
education, the environment, defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan also would provide a $300 billion tax cut over  
a period of years. 
</P>
<P>
	In his radio address, Clinton focused on the impact on the  
environment of a tax cut of the scope favored by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	He said their plan would ``require big cuts in environmental  
enforcement, letting toxic waste dumps fester, even shutting down 
national parks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also outlined new plans for cleaning up the nation's  
most polluted lakes, rivers and bays. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the Environmental Protection Agency plans to work  
with states ``to assess the state of all our waterways, to identify 
the most polluted waters and to develop strong, enforceable plans 
to restore them to health.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is a continuation of work begun in 1972 with passage of  
the federal Clean Water Act, he said, with a goal of producing 
water clean enough for swimming or fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite enormous progress under that landmark law, the president  
said, about 40 percent of the nation's waterways don't meet the 
swimming or fishing test. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents have a right to expect that our recreational waters  
are safe for their children to swim in,'' Clinton said. ``All 
Americans have a right to expect we're doing all we can to clean up 
our waterways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The states and the EPA already have identified about 20,000  
polluted waterways that fail to meet national water quality 
standards, said Carol Browner, the EPA administrator. For each, 
states must produce individual cleanup plans with timetables for 
completion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The list includes about 300,000 miles of rivers and shoreline  
and close to 5 million acres of lakes, Browner said at a briefing 
for reporters.

<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Honor Glide charged to the lead  
and posted a 3 1/4-length victory in Saturday's 25th running of the 
$400,000 Sword Dancer Handicap at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	Val's Prince lasted to be second of seven and it was another  
length to Chorwon. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagli, the favorite, lagged behind early as usual but failed to  
turn in his patented late run and finished last. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the second in three starts this year for Honor  
Glide, who carried 116 and Jose Santos 1 1/2 miles in 2:28:1. Honor 
Glide earned $240,000 for Bonnie Heath Farm and Robert Schaedle. 
</P>
<P>
	Honor Glide returned $14.60, $8.00 and $6.50. Val's Prince paid

<HEADLINE> Sea of Color Surrounds Straw Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Ginny Ricke peered out the door of her camper  
at a vast sea of tents, thousands of faces, and giant balloons 
floating softly overhead. Music blared around her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a spectacle,'' she said. ``How many cities can claim  
something like this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa Straw Poll was, indeed, a genuine American political  
spectacle. With Republican candidates throwing incredible amounts 
of time and money into the non-binding contest, the event has grown 
in momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials confessed to being overwhelmed and were busily  
adding polling places, and predicting privately that attendance 
could be as much as 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Democrat Ricke confessed to having a good time, and  
accomplishing a goal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Periodically I run out of rags so I come out and get some  
Republican T-shirts,'' she chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in mid-afternoon, sleepy Ames turned into a  
nightmarish traffic jam as a line of buses stretched for what 
appeared to be three or four miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Once at the scene, voters were treated to a richly colorful  
display that more resembled a county fair than a political rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates erected giant tents, and barbecue smoke wafted  
over the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork was the offering of choice, enough barbecue sandwiches and  
ribs to rescue a sagging farm economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it Iowa pork?'' asked Danette Hein-Snider at Elizabeth  
Dole's tent. ``Of course it is. It's the best in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publisher Steve Forbes and Texas Gov. George W. Bush had twin  
giant tent operations, both offering barbecue sandwiches to diners 
in lines that stretched for more than a city block. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, lines were everywhere -- lines to park, lines to eat and  
longer lines yet at the portable toilets, all being born in what 
seemed to be good humor. 
</P>
<P>
	I don't mind when it's a day like this when it's a crowd like  
this,'' said Mike Stimeman, of Spirit Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forbes tent was actually a tent complex. It featured an  
open-air eating tent, a press tent, and an air-conditioned 
entertainment tent complete with French doors at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	Onstage, Debbie Boone was resplendent in black sequins, crooning  
about being lonely and misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
	Sticking with his message, Gary Bauer featured a gospel chorus.  
</P>
<P>
	Pat Buchanan sported a rock band doing Elvis knockoffs. His  
campaign gave away free bottles of barbecue sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander brought in country singer  
Crystal Gayle, but his display -- featuring ribs and sandwiches -- 
was far less elaborate than some of the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers gazed enviously at the giant and jammed Forbes event.  
</P>
<P>
	``The buses aren't even here yet,'' said Tom Cope of Des Moines.  
``Where are they going to put the people when the buses come?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And then there were the buses, hundreds of them, some leased  
from Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	There was plenty of theater, of course.  
</P>
<P>
	Greg Happel dressed as Abraham Lincoln and sported Alan Keyes  
stickers on his top hat and black suit. ``It's a little bit hot, 
but not too bad,'' he said. ``It's worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two men were dressed as clowns and identified themselves only  
Magi and Y2K. ``We're with the entertainment,'' was the only 
explanation offered by Magi. 
</P>
<P>
	Joey Young strolled around on stilts greeting folks at the  
Forbes food tent. 
</P>
<P>
	The picture-perfect Iowa day, with a cloudless sky and  
comfortable temperatures, added to the picnic atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm kind of into politics, so I thought this was the place to  
be,'' said Frank Hannah.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 2, Burn 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Ezra Hendrickson scored in the first  
half and the Los Angeles Galaxy benefited from a Dallas own goal in 
the second half for a 2-0 victory over the Burn on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory moved the Galaxy into second place in Major League  
Soccer's Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made six saves for his  
eighth shutout of the season, snapping a tie with Dallas' Matt 
Jordan for the league lead. Jordan, second behind Hartman in 
goals-against-average, made three saves before a Rose Bowl crowd 
announced at 14,635. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrickson opened the scoring seven minutes into the match,  
putting in a rebound after Cobi Jones' penalty kick. Referee Noel 
Kenny awarded the Galaxy the penalty kick after a collision between 
a driving Marvin Quijano and Burn defender Brandon Pollard just 
inside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan guessed correctly on the penalty kick, diving low and to  
the left to make the save. But the ball bounced to Hendrickson, who 
lifted a shot above Jordan, who was still on the turf after 
stopping the penalty try. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy got its second goal in the 58th minute. Jordan tried  
to punch Greg Vanney's corner kick over the goal, but collided with 
a teammate, weakening his effort to put the ball out of play. Burn 
midfielder Ted Eck was positioned on the goal line and attempted to 
clear the ball away, but he struck it with his thigh and the ball 
flipped into the top of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles (14-8) won its third straight, and fifth of its last  
six. The Burn (11-12) lost for the third time in its last four. 
</P>
<P>
	Quijano, 19, made his first MLS start. He replaced Carlos  
Hermosillo, who missed his fourth consecutive game with a lower 
back strain.

<HEADLINE> Kyle Petty's Home Destroyed in Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLE OF PALMS, S.C. (AP) -- The homes of stock car driver Kyle  
Petty and Sen. Fritz Hollings were destroyed in a fire that swept 
through an upscale beach community. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire Friday at Wild Dunes began around sundown in one  
beachfront house, moved to Petty's house then crossed the street to 
Hollings' house. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty was not at home. Earlier in the day, he qualified 25th for  
the Frontier at the Glen NASCAR Winston Cup race in Watkins Glen, 
N.Y. Petty's publicist Chip Williams said Petty was staying at the 
Watkins Glen International race track in New York on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It spread rapidly,'' said Isle of Palms Fire Chief Ann Graham.  
``It was like a firestorm in there. Luckily no one was hurt. The 
property can be replaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials weren't immediately sure what caused the blaze, but  
said it caused millions of dollars worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollings and his wife, Peatsy, were in the house at the time of  
the fire, but were able to get out safely, said Maury Lane, 
Hollings' spokesman. They were staying with friends in Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, five houses burned before firefighters got the blaze  
under control, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a massive fire. I've never seen anything like it,''  
said Graham, who has been with the department since 1985. ``If it 
weren't for the cooperation (of other departments), we'd be out 
here for days.''

<HEADLINE> AltaVista Offers Free Web Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- AltaVista now offers free Web access, but  
its popularity will depend on whether users will be willing to put 
up with screen-hogging ads and less privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista requires customers to click on a window of ads and Web  
links on the computer screen at least once an hour, or be 
disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web search engine's service also monitors a customer's  
Internet usage to send them advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	If AltaVista succeeds in luring millions of Internet customers,  
as well as many more visitors to its network of sites, it could 
trigger a new movement by large access providers. AltaVista says 
it's signed up 50,000 users since launching the service Thursday 
and aims for 1 million users within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Several small upstarts, such as ZapMe! and Bigger.net, offer  
free Internet access that elsewhere costs up to $260 or more a 
year. But AltaVista stands out as the first major Web brand to join 
the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inevitable that these types of services will be  
offered,'' said AltaVista spokesman David Emanuel. ``We think it's 
a very viable economic model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether other providers will swap the monthly fees they rely on  
for revenue for less certain advertising sales remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Laszlo, who follows Internet usage for the Jupiter  
Communications research firm, said AltaVista's action is unlikely 
to force the top Internet content providers to provide free access. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, which drew more than 5 million new users in the past year  
despite raising its rates by $2 a month to $21.95, has no plans to 
give away the store, spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista, based in Palo Alto, Calif., was sold by Compaq  
Computer Corp. in June to the Internet investment firm CMGI Inc. 
for $2.5 billion in a deal that has not yet closed. 
</P>
<P>
	It is depending on 1stUp.com in San Francisco for computers and  
other hardware needed to provide Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say AltaVista, which ranked No. 10 among Web sites  
last month, has little choice but to take a radical approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to because they're so far behind,'' said Charlene  
Li, an analyst with Forrester Research. ``AOL and Yahoo! are just 
huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 1 million of the 63 million people online in the United  
States dial in for free, but that's changing as computer makers and 
even banks have begun to bundle free access with their own 
traditional services. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be somebody coming out next week offering free  
Internet service to compete with AltaVista that doesn't require 
clicking on an ad. So the bar will keep going down, down, down,'' 
Li predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some smaller companies offering free access, such as Bigger.net,  
have foundered over complaints of poor service and an endless 
streams of ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthias Gordon-Murer, a woodworker in San Francisco, eagerly  
signed up for a FreeMac offer of a new iMac computer next month in 
exchange for paying for three years of Internet access -- a $720 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that AltaVista is offering the same access for free, he's  
not sure the new computer is worth it. And like AltaVista, FreeMac 
will monitor his Internet usage -- a condition he'd rather do 
without. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like an electronic collar,'' said Gordon-Murer.  
``It turns me off.''

<HEADLINE> A Golfer Slips Across the Border  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- He is not Canada's most famous golfer. Nor  
even its most famous lefty. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Weir could be both -- someday. But at the moment, though  
tied for the lead as the last major this century heads into its 
last day, he is neither. In the hockey-mad Great White North, now 
that he's retired and out playing the celebrity golf tour, both 
those titles belong to Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	And to stake a claim on either one, Weir will have to play David  
against an even bigger Goliath, at least on this side of the 
border: a kid by the name of Tiger Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	The same Tiger Woods who beat him just five weeks ago in much  
the same situation and nearly the same place. They were paired 
together in the final round at the Western Open, barely 30 minutes 
away, where Weir shot a 70 to Woods' 71 and still lost the 
tournament by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely the underdog,'' Weir said. ``Tiger is the best  
player in the world. I lost my card last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is about as concise an assessment of the situation as  
anybody has offered. It's not that Weir scares easily. After a 
miserable 1997 season on the PGA Tour, he had to go to the 
much-dreaded qualifying school and win back his playing privileges. 
That was after kicking his way around bush-league tours back home 
and as far away as Australia. And simply growing up a left-handed 
golfer in a country where ice-fishing is a much bigger deal will 
teach you a thing or two about dealing with adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether the graduate course on trouble that Weir  
aced at last month's British Open has taught him enough to deal 
with Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir shot an 83 in his first tour over the brutal Carnoustie  
Golf Links, then made a double-bogey early in the second. Then the 
rain started in earnest. And the wind began to howl. And playing 
golf suddenly didn't seem all that different from the rounds Weir 
used to find himself trying to tack onto either side of the 
notoriously brief Canadian summers. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-9 and 150 pounds, Weir makes up in distance what he  
lacks in size by swinging hard even on the calmest of days. And 
when he found his groove in the midst of a Scottish gale, he 
started rocketing fairway woods into the small greens, stringing 
together a run of improbable birdies for a 71 that enabled him to 
play all the way through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the kinds of things that you can drop in on, so you  
know you can handle tough situations,'' he said. ``I did that 
today, when I had that 7-footer for par on 18. I really wanted that 
putt and what I did, to some extent, was just convince myself I 
could make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the putt rolled in for a 3-under 69, it was the last step  
ushering Weir back into the Tiger's den. But it wasn't until he 
slam-dunked a 30-yard chip shot from the right side of the green at 
No. 14 for an eagle that he was pointed in the right direction. 
Weir drew on some past athletic experiences for help with that one, 
too -- like just about every kid who grows up in Canada, he played 
hockey from the time he was little until his teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was average. Actually, I was pretty quick up until 13 or 14,  
but then everybody grew even or passed me. I played through high 
school,'' Weir said, ``but I was never a threat to the NHL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By then, he had been working at the golf course across the  
street for a half-dozen years and beginning to show some promise. 
And his personal hall of heroes had expanded to include Jack 
Nicklaus alongside Gretzky. He went so far as to write Nicklaus a 
letter and ask whether he should change over and try to hit the 
ball right-handed. The reply was no. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the greatest player of all time tells you to stick to it,  
then I was going to do it,'' Weir said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has yet to win a PGA Tour event, but Sunday marks the fourth  
time this year he will go off in the final group. To commemorate 
the last time, Weir is staying close to where he did for the 
Western Open and eating at some of the same restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's hoping for some of the same fan support. Though Weir is  
certain who the gallery will be pulling for, fans at the Western 
serenaded him with a few bars of ``O Canada'' on a few holes. He'd 
like to hear it again Sunday, even if it means humming the tune 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each time you're there,'' Weir said about playing in the final  
group, ``you start feeling a little more comfortable.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cassini To Buzz Earth on Saturn Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A two-story, $3.4 billion spacecraft  
carrying a load of deadly plutonium will zoom within 725 miles of 
Earth this week to gain momentum for the final leg of its 
meandering, seven-year voyage to Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassini's return, two years after NASA launched the largest and  
most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever, poses virtually no risk, 
mission officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	But anti-nuclear activists, concerned over the 72 pounds of  
carcinogenic cargo, aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is space technology can and does fail,'' said Bruce  
Gagnon of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in 
Space. ``And when you start using nuclear materials in increasing 
numbers, the odds of an accident increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flyby at 8:28 p.m. PDT Tuesday will use Earth's gravity to  
change the probe's direction and speed relative to the sun. Without 
the ``gravity assist'' and two previous close encounters with Venus 
and a future flyby of Jupiter, the probe would never reach its 
destination in 2004 to study Saturn's rings and moons. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe will approach Earth at about 35,000 mph. Its speed  
will increase by about 11,000 mph after the swingby. At its closest 
point over the South Pacific, the probe might be visible from 
Pitcairn or the Easter islands. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has used planets' gravity to fling its probes through space  
since 1973. The plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter twice 
swung by Earth in the early 1990s at altitudes much lower than 
Cassini's closest point. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances of an accidental re-entry of Cassini are about 1 in  
1.2 million, according to a NASA estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not a credible event,'' said Bob Mitchell, Cassini's  
program manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
``I'm not telling you it's impossible, but it's just not 
credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Activists fear that some sort of navigation or human error could  
cause the craft to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, showering the 
planet with deadly plutonium dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	Gagnon's group organized protests in the United States, England,  
Germany and elsewhere in June, but he admits there is little that 
can be done to change the spacecraft's course. A handful of 
anti-Cassini Web sites also have been set up. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests pale in comparison to events leading up to  
Cassini's October 1997 launch, when demonstrators threatened to 
chain themselves to the pad and filed lawsuits to stop the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft requires plutonium not for propulsion but to  
power its dozen scientific instruments. The probe's three 
radioisotopic thermoelectric generators, or RTGs, convert heat from 
the naturally decaying plutonium into electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The units were built especially strong in case of an accident  
during launch or flyby. Each pellet is boxed in layers of heat- and 
corrosion-resistant iridium and graphite. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said for re-entry to occur, a failure aboard the probe  
would have to cause an exact change in its speed before the flyby. 
And then something would have to happen to prevent NASA from 
transmitting corrective orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been flying this thing for two years now and we got a  
lot of practice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the capsules were to vaporize during an accidental  
re-entry, the effects on Earth's population over 50 years would be 
less than the amount of radiation from dental X-rays or a 
round-trip flight across the United States, according to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-nuclear activists, who dispute the numbers, say the space  
agency should be using safe solar energy to power all its probes. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists point out that Saturn is 10 times as far away  
from the sun as Earth and its solar panels would have to be the 
size of two tennis courts to harness enough energy.

<HEADLINE> Catfish Misses Yankees' Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yogi Berra was back and Dave Winfield made his  
New York Yankees Old-Timers Day debut. But most of the players 
gathered Saturday at Yankee Stadium talked more about who was 
missing than who was there. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio died in March, Whitey Ford is recovering from the  
loss of his son Tommy to a heart attack earlier this week and Jim 
``Catfish'' Hunter is in a North Carolina hospital suffering from 
Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody would like to see Whitey here. That's a shame,''  
said Berra, who is at his first Old-Timers Day since 1984, after 
ending a 14-year feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Catfish is another sad story. It's hard to talk about it.  
Everybody's pulling for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who is attending his sixth game this season at Yankee  
Stadium, was the main attraction for the fans. They gave him a 
lengthy standing ovation as he wore a Yankees uniform for the first 
time since being fired as manager in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra wasn't the only player making a return to Yankee Stadium.  
Dave Winfield, who played with the Yankees from 1981-90, attended 
his first Old-Timers Day since reconciling his own feud with 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad stuff is all behind us,'' said Winfield, who received  
one of the loudest ovations from the crowd. ``I'm glad to be here 
today. I feel like a part of this family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a family that has endured much sadness in the past year,  
from Darryl Strawberry's learning he had colon cancer last October 
to manager Joe Torre missing the beginning of the season with 
prostate cancer to the deaths of DiMaggio in March and his son 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's story is perhaps the saddest of all. He is in critical  
condition six days after he hit his head on concrete steps at his 
home. The 53-year-old Hunter remained in the intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad how bad things like this happen to good people,''  
said Graig Nettles, Hunter's teammate for five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who won 224 games and five World Series rings during his  
Hall of Fame career with the Athletics and Yankees, was diagnosed 
last year with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -- Lou Gehrig's 
disease, a gradual, irreversible deterioration of the muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to read about what's happening to him,'' Ron Guidry  
said. ``He meant so much to us as a player and a friend. You take 
it personally when something like that happens to a close friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had a moment of prayer for Hunter before playing the  
53rd Old-Timers day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all talked about him last night,'' Ed Figueroa said. ``We  
loved that guy. We hope he will be here next year with us.''

<HEADLINE> Ryder Cup Slips Away From Couples  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Somewhere between a tree and a valley, Fred  
Couples' chances of playing his way onto the Ryder Cup team were 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Needing to finish fourth all by himself at the PGA Championship,  
Couples fell apart on two holes Saturday and finished with a 3-over 
75. That leaves him at 1-over 217 after three rounds -- and almost 
certainly needing the generosity of captain Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``What else you got? Anything else?'' he said, growing testy  
when a reporter asked him about the Ryder Cup. ``Talk to me 
tomorrow night. I've got one more round in this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though a fourth-place finish seemed like a long shot, the 1992  
Masters champion seemed poised for a run at it after three birdies 
over the first 11 holes. Then, disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was at 5 under, cruising around,'' he said. ``Now I'm 1  
over, dilly-dallying around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His drive on the par-4 12th went right, landing in the rough  
behind some trees. He could have punched out, leaving himself about 
200 yards short of the green with par still possible. But he saw an 
opening in the trees and decided to take it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bad decision.  
</P>
<P>
	His ball hit a tree limb and dropped, leaving him no choice but  
to chip it out to the fairway. He two-putted and finished with a 
double-bogey. Then he bogeyed the par-3 13th, putting his tee shot 
in the sand behind the green. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst was still to come. On the par-4 16th, Couples' second  
shot left him about 60 yards short of the green. But instead of 
playing it safe and aiming for the back of the green, Couples went 
for the pin, which was sitting at the front left edge. His shot 
landed just off the green at the edge of a hill and began rolling 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	It kept rolling, finally coming to a rest in a valley. His  
second shot didn't even make it to that edge before it fell back. 
He finally got to the green on his third try and then two-putted. 
</P>
<P>
	A triple-bogey 7. From 2 under to 1 over.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was depressing and disappointing,'' he said. ``I need to go  
hit a few and try and come out tomorrow and feel like I did for 11 
holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing his way onto the Ryder Cup team is still a possibility,  
Couples said. Just not a very likely one. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me to be a solo fourth, I need to shoot about 65, which  
could happen,'' he said. ``I'd like to shoot in the 60s, but there 
aren't many of those going around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he doesn't finish fourth, Crenshaw could still put Couples on  
the team as one of his two captain's picks. But it might be a 
controversial choice, the last thing Crenshaw needs after the 
pay-for-play brouhaha. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples began the week in 17th place in the team standings, with  
the top 10 players making the team. While other bubble players like 
Tom Lehman, Steve Stricker and Chris Perry have been playing every 
week trying to pick up points, this is Couples' first tournament 
since June 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Even an eighth-place finish would have put him 12th in the  
standings, making him an easy choice for Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ryder Cup position, for me, is not based on today's round,  
tomorrow's round or yesterday's round. It's really based on the 
whole week,'' Couples said. ``If I keep hitting the ball like I was 
the first couple of holes today, I can tell Ben I'm playing pretty 
good golf.''

<HEADLINE> Chinese Immigrants Seized in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- Immigration officials say 132 Chinese men  
were found hiding in welded-shut, cramped quarters in a maze-like 
holding area of a docked cargo ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration and Naturalization Service officials say the men,  
who were carrying large sums of American money, probably paid 
thousands of dollars to get aboard the ship to be smuggled into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28 crew members of the Prince Nicolas, registered in Cyprus,  
were taken into custody for questioning. No charges had been filed 
as of Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very sophisticated ring,'' said Tom Fischer,  
district director for the INS in Atlanta. ``I have never in my 23 
years with INS seen anything this large or sophisticated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The immigrants were found Wednesday night, crammed into sealed  
individual compartments in the ship's bow. The compartments, each 
about 2 feet wide, 3 feet long and 6 feet high, had wooden bunks, 
electric fans, a hole in the floor for a toilet and were littered 
with empty water bottles, soda cans, food wrappers and clothing, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reminded me of something that would look like slave  
quarters,'' said Willie Anderson, assistant director for inspection 
with the INS in Atlanta. ``Other than being a little dehydrated, 
they were in pretty good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The men, 51 of whom were under 18, were taken to Atlanta on  
Friday. Authorities plan to deport them, but said they will look 
into requests for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to identify who they are, their date of birth and make  
sure they don't have a fear of returning to their home country,'' 
Anderson said. ``We want to make sure we don't send these people 
back to a country where they may be executed or face some kind of 
inhumane treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were tipped off to the Prince Nicolas about two weeks  
ago when the vessel's second officer jumped ship in Sweden and 
notified authorities, said INS Special Agent Kevin Keene. The 
40,000-ton ship's only other cargo was 27,000 tons of crude iron. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prince Nicolas had traveled from Denmark through the Baltic  
Sea, across the Atlantic Ocean and to Savannah, Fischer said. Its 
next port call was scheduled in Georgetown, S.C.

<HEADLINE> NBA's Elie Visits School in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Mario Elie felt proud when he  
returned to his parents' homeland and saw how a dedicated former 
political prisoner and soccer player was nurturing hope in 
disinherited slum kids. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Haitian, too. And I'm tired of hearing nothing but  
negative things about Haiti. But this is positive,'' said the 
35-year old Manhattan-born guard for the NBA champion San Antonio 
Spurs, who had been with the two-time champions Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie hadn't visited Haiti since he was 17. So when Bobby Duval,  
a soccer star who now helps underprivileged children, invited him 
to return, Elie jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval runs Haiti Athletic, a soccer school for poor kids that he  
has almost singlehandedly turned from a vacant lot four years ago 
into a soccer field and clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The asphalt of three basketball courts had just been poured, and  
Elie was there for the opening Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Located in suburban Drouillard, the field is near some of the  
poorest neighborhoods in this poorest country of the Western 
Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most are slum kids, and their models are juvenile  
delinquents,'' Duval said. ``But our kids won't turn into bums. 
They learn discipline and how to dream a brighter dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About half of Haiti's 8 million population is under 18.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of thousands of poor kids want to get involved in  
sports. I want to show them the way,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval's professional soccer career ended brutally in 1976, when  
he was accused of political activism during the Jean-Claude ``Baby 
Doc'' Duvalier dictatorship. He was arrested and imprisoned in the 
Fort Dimanche fortress for 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
	After Duvalier's exile in 1986, Duval became a political  
activist and went on to work in his family's construction business. 
Now at age 45, he works full time at keeping the school alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends, private-sector sponsors and private voluntary  
organizations provide the school with funds and supplies, but it 
survives on a month-by-month basis. Sometimes Duval cannot meet the 
payroll for his 20 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Duval's supervision, eight trainers teach soccer skills to  
more than 200 slum kids from ages 7 to 20. Hundreds more flock to 
the field to watch. Many of Duval's kids are so poor they come to 
practice barefoot. 
</P>
<P>
	At Haiti Athletic everything is free -- soccer gear and the hot  
meal the players get after practice. Duval also pays their school 
fees and medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said there is hope that Haitians may someday rebuild the  
ruined sports infrastructure that, in 1974, pushed Haiti into the 
World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti has 24 first division A dilapidated sports stadium was  
recently renovated, and the government runs a soccer camp for 
promising young players. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's hope for us. Haitians are doing things for Haitians,''  
Elie said.

<HEADLINE>  Iowa Poll Could Shape GOP Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Under carnival tents filled with free food and  
music, Republican presidential candidates courted Iowa voters 
Saturday in an informal poll that could reshape the GOP field. 
George W. Bush sought to solidify his front-runner status, but 
publisher Steve Forbes mounted a significant challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, Forbes and seven other White House hopefuls poured  
millions of dollars and spent hundreds of hours in this initial 
caucus state to test the potency of their political operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Introduced amid a burst of fireworks, patriotic tunes and a  
spray of balloons, Forbes didn't mention Bush name but took steady 
aim at the Texas governor. ``The power of these Washington elites 
won't be tamed, bent or broken by a candidate who relies on 
pollsters and tutors to tell him what he thinks,'' he told a 
capacity straw poll crowd that heard each candidate speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking a higher road, Bush called his rivals ``fine candidates''  
and stuck to his standard speech -- delivered with little passion. 
``Together, we will prove that someone who is conservative and 
compassionate can win without sacrificing principles,'' he said 
</P>
<P>
	Though no straw poll winner ever has won the GOP nomination, the  
contest has helped and hurt any number of candidacies ahead of the 
first real votes of the campaign season, the Iowa caucuses and the 
New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole and Lamar Alexander needed strong showings in the  
straw poll to remain viable as potential alternatives to Bush. 
After her address, Mrs. Dole was joined on the stage by her 
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Television commentator Pat Buchanan, Washington activist Gary  
Bauer, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, radio broadcaster Alan Keyes and 
former Vice President Dan Quayle struggled to emerge as the 
strongest social conservative candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, called the nonbinding poll a  
``sham'' and refused to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	As the polls closed, Bush team said they believed the governor  
had won by as many as 4,000 votes -- a solid showing by not as wide 
a margin as they had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush aides said they had purchased nearly 11,000 ballots and  
distributed most of them to supporters. Forbes officials had 
purchased 7,711 tickets, handing out all but 200. 
</P>
<P>
	But the aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had no way  
of knowing before the ballots were counted if supporters had 
actually taken the time to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' aides had urged his supporters to vote early, before  
herds of voters jammed polling stations. Bush's aides didn't -- and 
found many of their backers locked outside the main building after 
listening to a late-running music show. They scoured the grounds 
with bullhorns urging Bush backers to vote at alternative sites -- 
and not to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers shut the doors to the Hilton Coliseum, because it was  
at its capacity of 14,000. Party officials estimated that 24,000 
people were on hand to vote -- twice as many as expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sought a convincing victory to further distance himself  
from the pack with time running out on his rivals. He competed at 
the risk of tarnishing his image as the GOP's best vote-getter, the 
man most likely to win a general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes hoped to prove that he could convert his money, message  
and tireless work into an impressive number of votes. If he could 
not do it in a money-driven straw poll, questions were certain to 
be asked about his prospects down the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander needed to finish in the first four places to avoid  
dropping out of his second presidential race, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole draws huge crowds stocked with young and professional  
women. The poll was a test of whether they were serious political 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer scoured a network of churches and plumbed his contacts in  
the home-schooling community. He was the candidate that worried the 
other campaigns the most, because his support was hard to gauge. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan taunted the GOP establishment with insurgent campaigns  
in 1992 and 1996. He needed a strong showing to energize his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes is not a threat to win the nomination, but did well in the  
last straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, a late-entry to the field, looked for a jump start from  
the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle set his expectations low for Saturday, but knew that  
finishing behind lesser-known conservatives would cause political 
trouble.

<HEADLINE> Despite Drought, Green Lawns Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTERVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- Throughout much of the East, this  
summer's drought has left many homeowners with little to do in the 
way of mowing lawns. Most of the grass is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the case for Al Wooten.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just mowed, ah, the 30th time this summer,'' Wooten said  
Friday, checking a calendar in his garage where each appointment 
with his Lawn Boy is meticulously recorded. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the dry weather, the 58-year-old retired firefighter  
isn't ready to turn off his $1,500 computerized lawn irrigation 
system. Thus, in the midst of the drought, Wooten's lawn has only a 
couple of isolated yellow patches. 
</P>
<P>
	Wooten is among the residents in this Columbus suburb where Gov.  
Bob Taft last week asked people to voluntarily conserve water 
because of the worsening Eastern drought. 
</P>
<P>
	But driven by a fear of an inferior lawn, some despairing  
homeowners and gardeners have continued pampering their grass, with 
mixed results. Others have given up. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street from Wooten, Marcia Smith says there's personal  
pride and peer pressure to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personal, and the neighborhood,'' she explained. Letting the  
lawn go brown ``is just not going to work. If I had a farm, it 
might not make a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Pride,'' Wooten says over and over when asked why he stays  
devoted to green grass. ``People come by, they see automatically 
that you really have a nice lawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though grass is considered ugly in India and a haven for  
unwanted bugs in China, Americans love their lawns. More than 21 
million households spent $16.8 billion on professional lawn care 
and landscape services last year, according to the Professional 
Lawn Care Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there is pride and there is practicality. Across town, in  
an older subdivision of small ranch houses, most people say they've 
given up watering their yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Champlin, 53, says he wants a green lawn but doesn't want to  
waste water -- and the money to pay for it -- while wetting the 
grass. His lawn has seen better days but is mostly green. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want it to look halfway decent,'' said Champlin, a  
product safety manager. ``If it's going to die, let it die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Koonts spends at least five hours a week tending a  
half-acre lawn and a large vegetable garden. He's not watering his 
lawn much now, but doesn't miss a day with his garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what you do, you lose ground,'' said Bruce Koonts,  
39, as he headed into a hardware store that sells garden supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	From radishes and onions to raspberries and blackberries, Koonts  
said his produce has been smaller and just not as good this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in all the conversations,'' he said. ``We can't help but  
be focused on it -- are we ever going to get some rain?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of rain is taking its toll elsewhere as well.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Arboretum in Washington is in danger of losing a  
significant part of some of its plants and tree collections. Across 
the 446-acre outdoor museum, brown leaves hang on sagging branches. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, where pastures have been scorched bare and there  
isn't enough hay for feed, livestock auctions have been booming as 
farmers rid themselves of cattle that would be too costly to keep. 
</P>
<P>
	In Westerville, Jeff Suttle, manager of Roush Hardware, said  
most people who come into the store want to know when they can 
fertilize again. Until the rain returns, it's not advisable to put 
much down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, shiny 50-pound bags of fertilizer pile up unused on  
the showroom floor. But sales of hoses and sprinklers increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardware business is great. You hate to say it, but you  
thrive on people's misfortune,'' said Suttle, 25. ``Hurricanes, 
floods, drought, six feet of snow -- when there's a problem with 
nature, typically there's a way to offset it.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Semitism Fans New Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last week, Buford O. Furrow Jr. told police that his shootings  
in Los Angeles were ``a wake-up call to America to kill Jews.'' 
Last month, in a bloody rampage through the Midwest, Benjamin Smith 
took aim at blacks, Asians -- and Jews. Two weeks earlier, arsonists 
torched three synagogues around Sacramento, Calif., leaving behind 
leaflets that blamed Jews for the war in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Accurate figures about such hate crimes are as tough to track as  
the hate criminals themselves. While other minorities have 
suffered, American Jews seem to have been singled out in the most 
recent violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason for the stepped-up violence, experts suggest, is an  
old one: Members of hate groups blame Jews for all that's wrong in 
their lives. But there may be a new twist. This idea seems to be 
gathering momentum and followers to act on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Berlet, a senior analyst at Political Research Associates  
in Somerville, Mass., says demonizing, scapegoating and conspiring 
have been heightened by the approach of a new millennium. All this, 
he says, flows from the centuries-old notion that ``Jews are the 
puppetmaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If,'' he says, ``you oppose the U.S. foreign policy in the  
former Yugoslavia, you blame the Jews. If you think the economy 
isn't working for you, you blame the Jews. If you don't fit in the 
society as a straight white man, you blame the Jews.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Gans, director of the civil rights information center at  
the Anti-Defamation League in New York, lengthens the list. Today's 
anti-Semites, she says, ``blame Jews for the civil rights movement. 
They blame Jewish women for the women's rights movement. ... '' 
</P>
<P>
	Such talk is nothing new, says Mark Potok of the Southern  
Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala. Consider 19th century Russia 
where the czar's secret police concocted the Protocols of the 
Elders of Zion, a document ``recording'' rabbis who met in secret 
to take over the world. It was fiction, but the idea stuck. 
</P>
<P>
	``For centuries, Jews have been at the center of hate for being  
successful and being separate and being different,'' adds ADL's 
Gans. With enough talk about conspiracy, she says, there will be 
those who ``see Jews as people to be gotten rid of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Internet helps spread such messages.  
</P>
<P>
	E-zines such as The National Observer explore ``Jewish  
Supremacy: Those Who Want to Dominate a Multiracial Society Are 
Racial Supremacists; Those Who Want to Live in a Healthy, 
Homogeneous Society Are Racial Separatists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Web site for Posse Comitatus warns: ``Media Suppresses  
identity of these government heads. America's rulers -- They are all 
racist Jews! The racist Jewish mafia control America 100'' 
</P>
<P>
	After listing 64 members of the Clinton administration, it calls  
Clinton ``a corrupt and immoral President, married to a jewish 
'First Lady' Hillary 'R'. Clinton. With racist jews controlling 
Hollywood, the Media, he has given them total power to keep himself 
in the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Crawford, director of the Coalition for Human Dignity  
based in Seattle, ties most hate crimes to an ``ordinary-style 
bigot.'' But the white supremacist groups that his coalition tracks 
are especially dangerous, he says, because they raise hate ``to the 
level of a philosophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such groups are linked to the recent spate of spectacular hate  
crimes, in particular those targeting Jews. One is the Christian 
Identity movement, a religion that surfaced in the 1940s and gained 
more followers in the past 10 or 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Potok's researchers at the law center estimate 50,000 followers  
for this movement, which promotes the idea that Jews are Satan's 
offspring. Adherents view nonwhites, Potok says, as ``soulless 
mudpeople'' and all other whites as God's chosen people. 
</P>
<P>
	Statistics on hate crimes are hard to pin down. Earlier this  
year, the Anti-Defamation League reported that anti-Semitic 
incidents rose 2 percent last year after three years of decline. 
Most was due to a rise in vandalism against synagogues and other 
Jewish property. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI statistics are spotty due to uneven reporting. For 8,049  
cases in 1997, the most recent figures available, police reported 
3,120 black victims and 1,087 Jewish victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference, of course, may be explained in part by the  
difference in population. Of 270 million Americans, blacks comprise 
an estimated 12.8 percent, or 34.8 million, and Jews, about 2.2 
percent, or 6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, 37, has been charged in the attempted murder of four  
youngsters and one adult at the Jewish center. Investigators and 
those who track hate groups already trace him to such anti-Semitic 
groups as The Order, the Phineas Priesthood and the neo-Nazi Aryan 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	He also faces a murder charge in the death of a postal worker  
who, Furrow told police, provided a ``target of opportunity'' as a 
nonwhite federal worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Locations such as the Jewish community center in Los Angeles  
also are convenient targets. 
</P>
<P>
	The synagogue fires in Sacramento, set within minutes of each  
other in June, damaged two buildings and gutted the library of a 
third. Police suspect two brothers already charged with killing a 
gay couple. A search of their home turned up literature of World 
Church of the Creator, whose followers have been linked to violence 
against Jews, blacks and other non-whites. 
</P>
<P>
	At one time, Smith -- who went on a shooting spree in the Midwest  
-- also claimed membership in the World Church of the Creator. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, killed a black basketball coach and a Korean student  
and injured nine others in Indiana and Illinois. Then, as police 
closed in, he killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	What drove him?  
</P>
<P>
	A journal that police found in Smith's car lends a clue.  
``Anyone who knows the history of this plague upon humanity who 
calls themselves the Jews will know why I have acted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What drives others?  
</P>
<P>
	Much has been written about anti-Semitism, but Ms. Gans of the  
Anti-Defamation League says we have to keep looking. ``We're not 
going to find the answer because a few people have gone crazy.''

<HEADLINE> Black Veterans Seeking Pardon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of black World War II veterans wants  
President Clinton to clear the names of 50 black sailors 
court-martialed after an ammunition explosion 55 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, please hear us,'' said veteran Yale Lewis of  
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to stick with this until we get some results,''  
added Harry J. Baker, president of the World War II Black Navy 
Veterans of Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization held a wreath-laying ceremony Friday for the  
black sailors, who were court-martialed for mutiny for refusing to 
return to the loading docks after the July 1944 blast at the Port 
Chicago Naval Magazine near San Francisco that killed 320 men. 
</P>
<P>
	The black veterans are just the latest group to call for the  
men's pardons. Last month, the NAACP passed a resolution asking 
Clinton to pardon the sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two known surviving members of the sailors who were  
convicted and imprisoned. Supporters have asked for a speedy review 
because one of the sailors, Freddie Meeks of California, is in 
failing health. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said the matter was under review.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's being considered under the usual process at the Justice  
Department, and obviously the president will give careful 
consideration to that,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of those killed were members of the all-black loading  
crews that stacked bombs and other explosives aboard Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion was the worst domestic loss of life in World War  
II. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 Navy legal review concluded that the black seamen faced  
racial prejudice but found no grounds to overturn their 
courts-martial.

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Drops New Diabetes Treatment </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. has stopped development of an  
experimental drug to treat nerve damage from diabetes, joining 
other big drug companies that have failed to find a cure for the 
often-debilitating condition. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 16 million diabetics in the United States  
eventually will suffer from diabetic neuropathy, a complication 
characterized by extreme pain or loss of feeling in the hands and 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer was in late-stage human testing of its drug Alond when  
the company realized it found no improvement in patients taking the 
pill. Pfizer was testing Alond in 421 patients at 23 health centers 
across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer said part of the problem with Alond was in finding a way  
to detect whether nerves damaged by diabetes were growing back. 
Pfizer was taking biopsies of patients' nerves to measure any 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes advocates said Pfizer's announcement, which was made  
late Thursday, was a setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its always disappointing when you hope something is going to  
be a cure'' Marian Parrot, a spokeswoman for the American Diabetes 
Association, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer continues to study Alond to treat kidney and heart  
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1980s, several big pharmaceutical companies, including  
Merck and American Home Products, have tried to develop a drug to 
treat diabetic neuropathy. The goal has proven elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, doctors can only treat the symptoms of the  
condition with pain medication and antidepressants. And patients 
must learn to cope with the complication that gets progressively 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to reduce symptoms is though tight control of blood  
sugar levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech, a top biotech company, in April stopped development  
of its diabetic neuropathy drug after a study showed the 
experimental pill Neuleze was failing. Until then, Genentech was 
considered furthest along in the race to find an effective 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major drugmaker that has publicly disclosed it is still  
testing a drug for diabetic neuropathy is Warner-Lambert. The 
company's Zenarestat is in advanced human testing, though results 
of those studies are not expected for at least a year. Drug 
companies are not obligated to disclose which drugs they are 
researching. 
</P>
<P>
	Most securities analysts have become used to failures in  
diabetic neuropathy research so Pfizer's announcement was not a 
major blow for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Pfizer rose 50 cents to $34.50 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Boss and E Street Band Born Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- In '75, they were ``Born to Run'';  
nine years later they were ``Born in the USA.'' This summer, Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band -- dormant for the most of the 
past decade -- were born again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rebirth and rededication of our band,'' Springsteen  
said Thursday at the last show of his 15-night, sold-out New Jersey 
homecoming. ``We will continue to serve you as best we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300,000 fans heard the Boss at the Meadowlands area --  
the first leg of Springsteen and the band's first U.S. tour 
together since 1988's ``Tunnel of Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Good evening, New Jersey. We're going to bring it to you,''  
Springsteen, 49, said on Night No. 1 before launching into ``My 
Love Will Not Bring You Down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a month later, on Night No. 15, Springsteen teasingly  
asked, ``How can I say thanks?'' -- and then closed his stay with a 
blistering ``Rosalita.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be seeing you after a while,'' the Freehold, N.J.,  
native promised the rabid crowd, which had long wondered if a 
reunion between the Boss and the band would ever occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce and the band blasted anthems like ``Born to Run'' and  
``Backstreets.'' They trotted out obscure gems like ``Loose Ends'' 
and ``Frankie.'' Springsteen unveiled new material, too -- the 
show-closer ``Land of Hope and Dreams,'' along with a 
semi-autobiographical, semi-comical number called ``Freehold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen even took time to reveal the meaning of life: ``Cold  
beer at a reasonable price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans were ecstatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``The legend is there,'' said Ed Cronin, 39, who traveled down  
from Massachusetts to see his 41st Springsteen show. ``He's like 
Michael Jordan, Babe Ruth -- you can only compare Bruce to 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The critics were just as effusive.  
</P>
<P>
	``The legend ... came back to life in New Jersey last night, its  
power and promise undiminished by the passage of time,'' wrote Dan 
DeLuca of The Philadelphia Inquirer after opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	This was no nostalgia tour; until the last night, Springsteen  
ignored fans holding signs demanding his old show-closer, 
``Rosalita.'' The Boss had no new album to support, no new product 
to push (although the Jersey stand netted some $18 million in 
ticket sales alone). 
</P>
<P>
	The homecoming shows were the summer's hottest ticket, with  
desperate fans flooding phone lines with 15,000 calls per minute 
when the dates were announced. The first 10 shows, more than 
200,000 tickets, sold out in just five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Meadowlands officials acknowledged that Springsteen could have  
easily sold out more shows. As it was, the 15 dates in a single 
arena set an industry record, besting Springsteen's old mark of 11 
shows from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour, after a short hiatus, next hits Boston on Aug. 21  
before continuing to Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	On the last night in New Jersey, after ripping through 24 songs,  
Springsteen thanked the crowd effusively. Behind the stage, amid 
the cascading cheers, two young girls returned the favor, holding 
up a simple sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you,'' it read.

<HEADLINE> Ryder Revenue Donation Plan Underway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- The PGA of America should have a plan in  
place by year's end to distribute Ryder Cup revenues to charities 
of the players' choice, chief executive officer Jim Awtrey said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue cast a shadow over the PGA Championship this week,  
causing a rift between U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw and team members 
like Tiger Woods and David Duval, who believe players should be 
able to designate a charity to receive some of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	After a Tuesday meeting to clear the air, Crenshaw lashed out  
the next day, saying he was disappointed at the comments of some 
players who favored compensation. Those players were later 
identified as Duval, Woods, Mark O'Meara and Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
	``The captain is competitive and the team is competitive,''  
Awtrey said in a television interview with CBS Sports. 
``Pay-for-play is not an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said that distributing the money to charities is.  
</P>
<P>
	Awtrey said the PGA will ``form a plan by the end of the year to  
distribute money to the players' charities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Awtrey did not say what that plan might entail or whether it  
would be retroactive to this year's matches, in which the PGA of 
America is expected to turn a net profit of about $17 million from 
gross revenues estimated at $63 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour set a precedent in the Presidents Cup when $100,000  
was given to a charity of the players' choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I firmly believe we'll probably get something for charity, and  
I think that's great,'' Fred Couples said earlier in the week. 
``We'll all deserve it, and it will be a moot subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw later apologized for his outburst, but not for the way  
he feels about the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm from a different generation where the Ryder Cup means a  
lot to us,'' Crenshaw said. ``I'm upset people aren't jumping over 
the moon about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Ryder Cub is Sept. 24-26 at The Country Club in  
Brookline, Mass.

</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Sculptor Frederick Hart, best known for the  
``Creation Sculptures'' at the National Cathedral in Washington, 
died Friday of pneumonia after suffering from lung cancer. He was 
in his mid-50s. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-by-15 foot sculpture ``Ex Nihilo,'' a bas-relief work at

the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's work also includes the bust of South Carolina Sen. Strom  
Thurmond for the U.S. Capitol and the statue of former President 
Jimmy Carter for the Georgia Capitol grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was born in Atlanta in 1943 and spent his youth in South  
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Lindy, and two sons, Lain and  
Alexander.

 *Stanley G. Mortimer Jr.    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stanley G. Mortimer Jr., an advertising  
executive and member of an illustrious American family, died 
Wednesday after a long illness. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortimer, a descendant of John Jay, the first Chief Justice of  
the United States and a signer of the Declaration of Independence, 
died at his home in Harriman, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	A former director of advertising for both Trans World Airlines  
and Pan American World Airways, Mortimer grew up in Tuxedo Park, 
N.Y., a town his family helped found. 
</P>
<P>
	His grandmother, the widow of Henry Morgan Tilford, was  
considered one of the town's reigning dowagers for four decades. 
Tilford was a founder of the Standard Oil Company of California. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1940, Mortimer married Barbara Cushing. They divorced in 1946  
and she later married William S. Paley, the longtime leader of CBS. 
The following year, Mortimer married Kathleen H. Harriman, the 
granddaughter of railroad tycoon E.H. Harriman.

 *Lane Kirkland    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lane Kirkland, who reunited the major U.S.  
unions during his presidency of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, died 
Saturday of lung cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called Kirkland ``one of the towering figures  
in the American labor movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born of southern aristocracy in Camden, S.C., and schooled in  
international relations at Georgetown University, Kirkland bucked 
the stereotypes of union leadership when he was elected AFL-CIO 
president in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed for reunification of the nation's largest and  
best-known unions under the AFL-CIO because, he said, ``all sinners 
belong in the church.'' By 1990 he had brought back the United Auto 
Workers, the Teamsters, the West Coast Longshoremen, Chemical 
Workers, Mine Workers and Locomotive Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO under Kirkland reached out to workers in other  
countries where the trade union movement was suppressed, including 
Poland, South Africa, China, Cuba and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland was born heir to a long line of Southern cotton growers  
whose roots date back to the American Revolution. As a teen-ager, 
he enrolled in the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy and served as an 
officer during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Irena, five children, five  
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. 

</P>

 *Pee Wee Reese    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pee Wee Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop and  
Brooklyn Dodgers captain who smoothed Jackie Robinson's entry into 
major league baseball as its first black player, died Saturday. He 
was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Dodgers confirmed Reese's death. It was not  
immediately known where the Kentucky native died or the cause of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags at Dodger Stadium were flown at half-staff for Saturday  
night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese, who overcame prostate cancer years ago, underwent  
radiation treatment for lung cancer in March 1997. He also was 
recovering from a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-time All-Star, Reese led the Dodgers to seven National  
League pennants and helped Brooklyn win its only World Series 
championship in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese played a key role in easing Robinson's road into the  
majors in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	During one particularly tough time when the abuse was getting  
ugly at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, Reese walked over and put his 
arm over the rookie's shoulder, a show of unity from a white to a 
black that spoke volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a big picture of it, both of us laughing, hanging in  
my den,'' Reese said a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese was inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 1984.  
</P>
<P>
	After his baseball career, Reese worked as a broadcaster with  
CBS, NBC and the Cincinnati Reds. He later became director of the 
college and professional baseball staff at Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, 
maker of Louisville Slugger bats.

<HEADLINE> Catfish Misses Yankees' Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yogi Berra was back and Dave Winfield made his  
New York Yankees Old-Timers Day debut. But most of the players 
gathered Saturday at Yankee Stadium talked more about who was 
missing than who was there. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe DiMaggio died in March, Whitey Ford is recovering from the  
loss of his son Tommy to a heart attack earlier this week and Jim 
``Catfish'' Hunter is in a North Carolina hospital suffering from 
Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody would like to see Whitey here. That's a shame,''  
said Berra, who is at his first Old-Timers Day since 1984, after 
ending a 14-year feud with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	``Catfish is another sad story. It's hard to talk about it.  
Everybody's pulling for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra, who is attending his sixth game this season at Yankee  
Stadium, was the main attraction for the fans. They gave him a 
lengthy standing ovation as he wore a Yankees uniform for the first 
time since being fired as manager in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra wasn't the only player making a return to Yankee Stadium.  
Dave Winfield, who played with the Yankees from 1981-90, attended 
his first Old-Timers Day since reconciling his own feud with 
Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bad stuff is all behind us,'' said Winfield, who received  
one of the loudest ovations from the crowd. ``I'm glad to be here 
today. I feel like a part of this family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is a family that has endured much sadness in the past year,  
from Darryl Strawberry's learning he had colon cancer last October 
to manager Joe Torre missing the beginning of the season with 
prostate cancer to the deaths of DiMaggio in March and his son 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's story is perhaps the saddest of all. He is in critical  
condition six days after he hit his head on concrete steps at his 
home. The 53-year-old Hunter remained in the intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad how bad things like this happen to good people,''  
said Graig Nettles, Hunter's teammate for five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter, who won 224 games and five World Series rings during his  
Hall of Fame career with the Athletics and Yankees, was diagnosed 
last year with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -- Lou Gehrig's 
disease, a gradual, irreversible deterioration of the muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to read about what's happening to him,'' Ron Guidry  
said. ``He meant so much to us as a player and a friend. You take 
it personally when something like that happens to a close friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees had a moment of prayer for Hunter before playing the  
53rd Old-Timers day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all talked about him last night,'' Ed Figueroa said. ``We  
loved that guy. We hope he will be here next year with us.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Railway Killer Reveals Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Ignoring legal advice, multiple murder defendant  
Angel Maturino Resendiz sent a rambling letter to a television 
station, touching on topics ranging from why he surrendered to how 
much he loves his dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 11-page letter received by Houston station KTRK, Maturino  
Resendiz didn't discuss the string of killings across three states 
that put him on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List, but did make an 
ominous reference to a ``creature'' inside him that scares him. 
</P>
<P>
	Written in English, the letter contains numerous spelling and  
grammatical errors. KTRK aired segments about the letter in 
newscasts on Thursday and Friday. The station got the letter 
Thursday and verified its authenticity by checking a mail receipt 
from the Harris County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most striking passage written by the drifter from  
Mexico was about an inner demon, which he calls his ``enemy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife has a flourescent black light. We turn off all the  
lights, on the black light. I was so afraid as never before as I 
look in the mirror, my enemy was me in a different light,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been fighting this creature all of my life, and now I  
know it is me, so I fear, yes I fear and shake,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Allen Tanner said Maturino Resendiz ignored his  
directions to avoid contact with news media. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gets a bunch of letters in jail from media,'' Tanner said.  
``I told him not to respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz, 40, is being held without bond, charged with  
four killings in Texas, two in Illinois and one in Kentucky. He is 
also a suspect in two other Texas killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz gave up in El Paso on July 13 in a surrender  
brokered by his relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, he wrote that he didn't surrender ``because I was  
good; the reason was I fear that the U.S.A. was going to put my 
wife in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``And they made many threats to my family, is the reason my  
family help the USA get me here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter also mentioned topics including the death last month  
of John F. Kennedy Jr. in a plane crash, President Kennedy and the 
Bay of Pigs incident with Cuba and the Kennedy family's suffering. 
He also wrote about how much he loves his dogs back in Mexico.

	GOP Candidates Facing Iowa Test  
</P>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa voters today will shed a little light on  
the Republican race for the presidential nomination, and whether or 
not Texas Gov. George W. Bush can win as easily as many people 
predict. Even his rivals are pointing to Bush as the one to beat 
today, and a confident-sounding Bush and his aides did absolutely 
nothing to dispel that perception. ``I'm going to look at it as an 
opportunity to bolster my organization and find out whether we need 
work -- if we need any work at all,'' Bush said yesterday.

	Report: Officer Lax With LA Suspect  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Months before a white supremacist was accused  
of firing on a Jewish center and killing a postal worker here, he 
was ordered by a judge in Washington to give up his guns. But 
according to a report in today's Los Angeles Times, Buford O. 
Furrow Jr.'s probation officer never checked to see if he complied 
with the judge's order, and did not make recommended visits to his 
home. Washington state corrections officials say they'll review the 
handling of the probation of Furrow, who this week was charged with 
murder and attempted murder for the attacks that apparently were 
fueled by hate. Furrow met five times with the probation officer, 
but there were no visits to his home.

	NATO Troops Go To Mass Grave  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO troops and Canadian forensic  
experts congregated today in a Kosovo village to investigate 
reports of a newly found mass grave containing victims of 
Serb-Albanian ethnic bloodshed. A statement by the NATO-led Kosovo 
peacekeeping force said U.S. troops and the forensic team were at 
Donja Stubla, a village near Vitina, about 25 miles south of 
Pristina, the provincial capital. Most victims found in mass graves 
have been Albanians, killed during the pinnacle of the more than 
yearlong Serb crackdown on Kosovo's Albanian majority that ended in 
June after NATO's bombing campaign led to a pullout of Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic's forces.

	N. Korean Diplomat: No Missile Test  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A North Korean diplomat in Moscow today denied  
reports that his country was planning to test a second ballistic 
missile, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The diplomat, based at the 
North Korean Embassy in Moscow, lashed out at Japanese plans to ask 
Russia to try to prevent such a test. Japan's Defense chief Hosei 
Norota is due in Russia on Sunday and has said he would appeal to 
Russian diplomats to intervene. The North Korean diplomat, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity, called that ``another 
provocation'' and urged Moscow to resist any such appeal, ITAR-Tass 
said.

	Evolution Decision May Spur Suits  
</P>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A controversial decision by Kansas' state  
school board to de-emphasize the teaching of evolution could result 
in lawsuits filed against school districts, the American Civil 
Liberties Union says. The ACLU, in a letter yesterday to school 
superintendents, warned the districts about adopting 
``religiously-based standards'' in teaching science. The ACLU also 
noted U.S. Supreme Court decisions that forbid the teaching of 
creationism, the belief that a higher power created the universe, 
because of its religious foundation.

	Four Killed in Kashmir Attack  
</P>
<P>
	MANSBAL, India (AP) -- Suspected militants attacked an army camp  
in India's northern Kashmir region before dawn today, killing at 
least two soldiers and injuring 14 others. Positioned on 
surrounding hills, the militants targeted the camp and escaped 
after the attack, a police officer said on condition of anonymity. 
The Mansbal camp is 20 miles northeast of Srinagar, the summer 
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. No group claimed responsibility for 
the attack, which was the fifth assault by militants on an army 
camp in Kashmir this month.

	US: China Not Planning Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite high tensions between the two  
countries, U.S. officials say they don't see any signs of an 
imminent attack by China against Taiwan. ``It's the United States 
government judgment that there aren't any extraordinary 
developments or signs that there is a mobilization on the PRC's 
(People's Republic of China) part,'' National Security Council 
spokesman David Leavy said yesterday. Questions about China's 
intentions arose after Chinese officials sounded out U.S. 
specialists on how the Clinton administration might respond to 
military action against Taiwan.

<P>
	ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) -- Ernie Grunfeld, fired as the New York  
Knicks' general manager just before they went on a roll that took 
them to the NBA Finals, is taking over in the Milwaukee Bucks' 
front office. Grunfeld replaces Bob Weinhauer, who was let go by 
the Bucks earlier this week after two years as general manager. The 
Bucks decided not to renew Weinhauer's contract shortly after free 
agents Michael Curry and Dell Curry said they would leave the team.

<HEADLINE> AltaVista Offers Free Web Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- AltaVista now offers free Web access, but  
its popularity will depend on whether users will be willing to put 
up with screen-hogging ads and less privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista requires customers to click on a window of ads and Web  
links on the computer screen at least once an hour, or be 
disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web search engine's service also monitors a customer's  
Internet usage to send them advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	If AltaVista succeeds in luring millions of Internet customers,  
as well as many more visitors to its network of sites, it could 
trigger a new movement by large access providers. AltaVista says 
it's signed up 50,000 users since launching the service Thursday 
and aims for 1 million users within a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Several small upstarts, such as ZapMe! and Bigger.net, offer  
free Internet access that elsewhere costs up to $260 or more a 
year. But AltaVista stands out as the first major Web brand to join 
the trend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inevitable that these types of services will be  
offered,'' said AltaVista spokesman David Emanuel. ``We think it's 
a very viable economic model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether other providers will swap the monthly fees they rely on  
for revenue for less certain advertising sales remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Laszlo, who follows Internet usage for the Jupiter  
Communications research firm, said AltaVista's action is unlikely 
to force the top Internet content providers to provide free access. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL, which drew more than 5 million new users in the past year  
despite raising its rates by $2 a month to $21.95, has no plans to 
give away the store, spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista, based in Palo Alto, Calif., was sold by Compaq  
Computer Corp. in June to the Internet investment firm CMGI Inc. 
for $2.5 billion in a deal that has not yet closed. 
</P>
<P>
	It is depending on 1stUp.com in San Francisco for computers and  
other hardware needed to provide Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts say AltaVista, which ranked No. 10 among Web sites  
last month, has little choice but to take a radical approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to because they're so far behind,'' said Charlene  
Li, an analyst with Forrester Research. ``AOL and Yahoo! are just 
huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 1 million of the 63 million people online in the United  
States dial in for free, but that's changing as computer makers and 
even banks have begun to bundle free access with their own 
traditional services. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be somebody coming out next week offering free  
Internet service to compete with AltaVista that doesn't require 
clicking on an ad. So the bar will keep going down, down, down,'' 
Li predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some smaller companies offering free access, such as Bigger.net,  
have foundered over complaints of poor service and an endless 
streams of ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthias Gordon-Murer, a woodworker in San Francisco, eagerly  
signed up for a FreeMac offer of a new iMac computer next month in 
exchange for paying for three years of Internet access -- a $720 
commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that AltaVista is offering the same access for free, he's  
not sure the new computer is worth it. And like AltaVista, FreeMac 
will monitor his Internet usage -- a condition he'd rather do 
without. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like an electronic collar,'' said Gordon-Murer.  
``It turns me off.''

<HEADLINE> Women Vets Remembering Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Sandie Wilson wakes nearly nightly from  
dreams of mangled soldiers crying out for their mothers as they lay 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Unable to escape memories from her days as a field surgical  
nurse during the Vietnam War, she has been diagnosed with 
post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The war is over, but for her and other women veterans the fight  
continues for what they say is overdue recognition of physical and 
emotional sacrifices they made. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, a handful of such women gathered at the Vietnam Veterans  
of America's annual convention to work toward improving medical 
treatment for women by the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The services for women at VA hospitals are being cut or don't  
exist. There's a VA hospital in Seattle that doesn't have the money 
to hire somebody to do gynecological exams. In Los Angeles, the VA 
has a wonderful mammography machine that's not being used,'' said 
Dr. Linda Schwartz, chairwoman of the VA's Advisory Committee of 
Women Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Today there are 1.7 million women veterans, ranging from World  
War II to the Gulf War, and it's estimated more than half rely on 
VA services for medical treatment, said Schwartz, a retired Air 
Force major. 
</P>
<P>
	The advisory committee, responsible for making recommendations  
to the VA, has recommended 46 changes for treating women, ranging 
from hiring specialized doctors to increasing types of treatments. 
The VA is considering the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the women veterans also called for more medical studies  
to be conducted about the impact of the defoliation agent, known as 
Agent Orange, sprayed on the jungles of Vietnam. They cited the 
contact nurses had with exposed soldiers and the high number of 
babies with birth defects born to women veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know there's something wrong,'' said Ms. Wilson of Saline,  
Mich., who retired from the Army as a lieutenant colonel. ``It's 
time it was addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the male veterans at the convention said they supported  
the women's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of these men here probably wouldn't be standing around  
talking if it hadn't been for those nurses,'' said Dave Simmons, 
50, of Bluefield, W.Va., who credits a nurse with saving his life 
after being wounded in 1969 at Chu Lai. 
</P>
<P>
	``They went through as much as we did. My unit saw a lot of  
fighting, but it usually wasn't every day. Those women dealt with 
it -- the injuries and the death -- every day. They deserve credit 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doris ``Lucki'' Allen, 78, whose experience as a military  
intelligence officer was chronicled in the book ``A Piece of My 
Heart,'' said the gathering also was a chance for women veterans to 
share a common bond. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance for us to say `We're together, we're unique,'''  
she said. ``There's a camaraderie you feel with people you don't 
know, because you've been through the same thing. We have the same 
memories of joy and pain.''

<HEADLINE> Stone Temple Pilots Singer Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stone Temple Pilots lead singer Scott Weiland  
is back in jail because of illegal drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	The rock star had been on probation, receiving outpatient  
treatment for drug addiction, but in July he received hospital 
treatment for a heroin overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland was sent to jail ``to show that this will not be  
tolerated ... (and) to help him make up his mind to stop killing 
himself,'' Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland was taken to the hospital ward at the Los Angeles County  
Men's Central Jail. His next court date is Sept. 5. He had wanted 
to be sent to a court-ordered drug program, but the judge noted 
that hadn't worked previously. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer was arrested in 1995 for possession of cocaine and  
heroin in Pasadena. Charges were dropped in exchange for completing 
a diversion program but he was arrested again in 1997 and pleaded 
guilty to heroin possession last summer. He was later kicked out of 
a rehabilitation program in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, he also pleaded guilty to drug possession in New  
York.

<HEADLINE>  Women's Basketball Team Adds Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Adding five more players to the U.S. women's  
national basketball team was simple enough. Now if USA Basketball 
could only find a way to add another month to the calendar before 
next year's Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the run-up to the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, when the U.S.  
women went undefeated in a 52-game tour, there is now a 
professional league that takes up the summer months. The success of 
the 1996 team spawned the WNBA; now the WNBA is both a blessing and 
an inconvenience in the preparations for Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time around, we don't have the luxury of time,'' said  
Carol Callan, assistant executive director of USA Basketball. ``We 
have players whose schedules are filled, and they're very busy 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callan formally announced the addition of the Cynthia Cooper,  
Chamique Holdsclaw, Yolanda Griffith, Natalie Williams and DeLisha 
Milton to the U.S. team at a news conference Saturday at the MCI 
Center. Officials had confirmed their selections earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	They join five ``core'' national team players named last year:  
Lisa Leslie, Nikki McCray, Katie Smith, Dawn Staley and Ruthie 
Bolton-Holifield. Two more players will be added next year to 
complete the 12-player Olympic roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is coached by Nell Fortner, who guided the United  
States to a gold medal at last year's World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Since all 10 members of the team play in the WNBA, they now face  
a year of nonstop basketball. Following the WNBA season, they will 
gather in San Diego for the U.S. Olympic Cup tournament, which runs 
Sept. 9-12 and includes the national teams from Australia, Poland 
and Brazil. The same four teams then travel north for the USA 
Basketball International Tournament, Sept. 13-18 in Palo Atlo, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team will stay together through most of the fall and  
winter, playing a 12-game college exhibition tour and perhaps 
another dozen or so games against various international teams 
before the WNBA training camps open in May. The WNBA season usually 
runs through early September, although Callan said she's received 
indications that the WNBA may wrap up a couple of weeks earlier so 
the Olympic team can reassemble Aug. 14 and perhaps travel to 
Hawaii to break up time zone differential on the way to Sydney. The 
Olympics begin Sept. 16, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's tough,'' McCray, a member of the 1996 Olympic  
team, said of the schedule. ``But when you've played in the 
Olympics and you know what it feels like to win a gold medal, 
you're willing to make a sacrifice and do whatever it takes to get 
to that level again. We don't have much time to train, but we have 
to take advantage of the time that we do have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although USA Basketball is having to schedule around the WNBA,  
Callan said the presence of the league has made the U.S. players 
more team-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before 1995, they were able to play, but they played in Europe  
and there was always this thing where the American players were 
paid to score,'' Callan said. ``So we spent a year teaching defense 
to that '95-'96 team. Now when you look at them here in these 
domestic leagues, the development of the player is more 
well-rounded.''

<HEADLINE> Lions' Russell To Miss Season Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- For the second year in a row, Detroit Lions  
linebacker Matt Russell has seen his season stop with one 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell hurt his left knee midway in the fourth quarter of the  
Lions' 34-31 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell, who probably will miss the entire season, didn't  
survive the preseason opener last year, either. Against the Arizona 
Cardinals, Russell damaged his right knee on the opening kickoff 
and was sidelined for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the really fine people in our program, one of the  
most upbeat, positive people we could ever have,'' coach Bobby Ross 
told the Detroit Free Press. ``He's got a serious knee injury. He 
has a dislocation and maybe a ruptured patella too, so it's going 
to take some surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell got in one big play before his injury, scoring on a  
16-yard interception-return touchdown in the third quarter.

<HEADLINE> Questions on U.S. Joining Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The issue that dominated three weeks of  
negotiations on the world's first permanent war crimes tribunal 
wasn't even on the agenda: What will it take for the United States 
to join the court? 
</P>
<P>
	With the answer hanging in limbo, more than 100 countries made  
``good progress'' on key legal issues during the second round of 
preparatory negotiations for the International Criminal Court, said 
Philippe Kirsch, chairman of the preparatory commission. The 
meeting ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the private talks between U.S. Ambassador David  
Scheffer and national leaders that generated the most interest. 
Scheffer is trying to find a legal solution that will enable 
Washington to sign the treaty creating the tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States was one of seven countries that last year  
voted against establishing the tribunal. The treaty was approved by 
120 other countries and has since been signed by 84 of those and 
ratified by four. 
</P>
<P>
	American officials felt the treaty yielded too much  
prosecutorial power to the new court, leaving U.S. troops and 
citizens vulnerable to politically motivated prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's opposition hasn't diminished. But a spokesman for  
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- whose chairman, North 
Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, is an outspoken opponent of 
the court -- was in New York this week and praised the change in the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-American sentiment rampant in Rome last year when the  
treaty was adopted has been replaced by an ``era of good feelings'' 
and a willingness among governments to work with the United States 
to address U.S. concerns, said Marc Thiessen, committee spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Thiessen said, the big hurdle remains in place: The  
Clinton administration wants an exception from investigation or 
prosecution by the court for personnel involved in official 
military actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Dicker, associate counsel for Human Rights Watch, said  
an exception for official acts would render the court ``null and 
void'' and allow the Saddam Husseins of the world to get away with 
crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a loophole the size of the Grand Canyon that any rogue  
state would drive right through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thiessen said carving out protection for the United States, but  
not for Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic, is going to be 
difficult. ``I, quite frankly, don't know how they are going to 
thread the needle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheffer, the ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues, said  
the United States wants ``a clear recognition that states sometimes 
engage in very legitimate uses of military force to advance 
international peace and security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. proposals are expected to be on the table when the  
third round of negotiations gets under way in late November.

	Voting Underway at Iowa Straw Poll

<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Voting is under way tonight in Iowa as  
Republican presidential candidates jockey for the top spot in a 
straw poll. George W. Bush seeks to distance himself from the pack, 
but publisher Steve Forbes is expected to put up a stiff challenge. 
Arizona Senator John McCain didn't take part in the event. He calls

	Pressure To Oust Milosevic Mounts  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- From all ends of Yugoslavia's  
political spectrum, pressure is mounting to oust President Slobodan 
Milosevic. Vice premier Tomislav Nikolic -- an ultranationalist -- 
told a German magazine that Milosevic should resign ``not because 
the West demands it, but rather because he capitulated in Kosovo.'' 
Serbia's opposition leaders today warned Milosevic to resign or 
face an intense round of fall protests. At demonstrations scheduled 
for Aug. 19 in Belgrade, ``the regime would be given 10 to 20 days 
to leave,'' said Zoran Zivkovic of the Democratic Party.

vigilantes have been blamed in a government inquiry into the raid 
on a student dormitory that sparked Iran's largest mass protests 
since the 1979 revolution, state-run media said today. The report 
on the July 9 raid was likely to boost the standing of reformist 
President Mohammad Khatami, who had criticized the police raid, in 
his power struggle with hard-line clerics. The raid on a Tehran 
University dormitory prompted six days of nationwide protests 
demanding democratic reforms.

Jewish community center in Los Angeles, postal workers in uniform 
were among the hundreds of friends and family who packed a chapel 
for the funeral of a Filipino American mail carrier allegedly slain 
by a white supremacist. Buford O. Furrow, 37, is jailed in 
connection with the slaying of Joseph Ileto, 39. Furrow is accused 
of shooting Ileto nine times, several in the back of his head. He 
allegedly told investigators that the postal worker was a good 
``target of opportunity'' to kill because he was of Filipino 
descent and worked for the federal government.

<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces fought Islamic  
militants in scattered skirmishes in Dagestan today, suffering at 
least four deaths as officials admitted that the rebels remained in 
control of seven villages. The fighting was concentrated in the 
Caucasus region of Dagestan, a mountainous Russian republic that 
borders breakaway Chechnya. Many of the militants belong to the 
fundamentalist Wahhabi sect and are seeking an independent Islamic 
republic in the mostly Muslim regions of the Caucasus Mountains.

<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand's prime minister has ordered  
the military to find the bodies of 38 people still listed as 
missing after clashes between troops and pro-democracy protesters 
seven years ago. In May 1992, tens of thousands of Thais poured 
into Bangkok's streets to protest an attempt by the military regime 
to stay in power rather than calling promised elections. Troops 
ultimately fired into the crowds, killing at least 50 people, 
wounding 100 and leaving scores missing. Prime Minister Chuan 
Leekpai was responding to the request of family members of the 
missing.

	Mets Beat Giants 6-1  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Orel Hershiser pitched six strong innings  
and Mike Piazza went 4-for-5 with a home run to lead the New York 
Mets past the San Francisco Giants 6-1 today. Piazza is 10-for-14 
over his last three games, with two homers and six RBIs. His 
two-run shot in the fourth off Kirk Rueter (10-7) erased a 1-0 
deficit and sparked a decisive five-run rally.

	Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese Dies  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pee Wee Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop and  
Brooklyn Dodgers captain who smoothed Jackie Robinson's entry into 
major league baseball as its first black player, died today. He was 
81. The Los Angeles Dodgers confirmed Reese's death. It was not 
immediately known where the Kentucky native died or the cause of 
death. Nicknamed ``The Little Colonel,'' the eight-time All-Star 
led the Dodgers to seven National League pennants and helped 
Brooklyn win its only World Series championship in 1955.

<HEADLINE> Experts Say This Drought Is Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As dry spells go, the drought of 1999 is  
merely average in size. 
</P>
<P>
	But if historical climate patterns hold true, Americans are due  
for a major one that would cover at least a third of the country -- 
and they are not prepared to deal with it, say government officials 
and drought experts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such droughts come about once a decade; the last one was in  
1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The country does not have an integrated network of observation  
stations for monitoring droughts as they develop. Communities 
frequently do not implement water conservation measures until they 
are running low on water. Thousands of farmers do not buy crop 
insurance even though the government heavily subsidizes the 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to do more,'' said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman,  
who heads a new federal commission charged with recommending a 
national policy for dealing with droughts. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes and floods are ``like heart attacks, quick strikes  
that compel people to spring immediately into action. But drought 
is like a cancer, slow, insidious and not always easy to detect in 
the early stages,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's drought has parched crops from Virginia into parts  
of the Midwest and forced suburbs from Washington to New York to 
restrict water use. Philadelphia has banned the use of tinder-dry 
athletic fields. So far, the drought has affected about 15 percent 
to 20 percent of the country, about normal for most years. 
</P>
<P>
	If it continues into the winter, and weather forecasters think  
it may, the drought could expand across the nation's heartland and 
become one of the droughts of the century. If it's not this one, 
another big drought should be coming soon, said Albert Peterlin, 
the Agriculture Department's chief meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a history of drought spreading westward into the crop  
area. If this drought were to continue into the winter, it could be 
the drought we're talking about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1988 drought reached 36 percent of the country and destroyed  
crops throughout the Plains. Droughts in 1977 and 1963 covered 32 
percent of the nation, and in 1954, nearly 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	At the height of the Dust Bowl, in 1934, two-thirds of the  
country was in drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Close to normal rainfall is expected in the Northeast this fall,  
but that will not be enough to make up for this year's shortfall, 
according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Drought experts say farmers and community leaders on the East  
Coast could have been better prepared for this year's drought if 
they had been warned sooner or if they had paid closer attention to 
weather forecasts -- drought conditions were showing up on 
precipitation reports 13 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this country, we spend very little money with regard to  
drought. We spend very little money on mitigation,'' said Don 
Wilhite, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center at the 
University of Nebraska. ``What we tend to do is wait until the next 
drought and the federal government opens its checkbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recently told Glickman's commission that the government  
should force communities and farmers to take responsibility for 
addressing droughts. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of the Plains states, many farmers do not bother with  
crop insurance. Although more Eastern farmers bought policies this 
year, according to USDA, coverage levels are still expected to be 
relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland last year, just half the soybean crop was insured  
and 43 percent of the corn. In Ohio, 48 percent of the corn was 
covered and 37 percent of the soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, 99 percent of the cotton in Texas and 94 percent  
of the wheat in North Dakota was insured last year. Coverage 
figures for this year are not available. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to entice more farmers into the system, Congress is  
considering doubling the federal insurance subsidy to $3 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Melvin Baile, Jr., who farms near New Windsor, Md., said he  
learned his lesson two years ago when he lost an uninsured corn 
crop to drought. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he paid $15 an acre to insure his corn and $10 an  
acre to cover his soybean crop. The policies guarantee him a 
minimum return this fall regardless of what happens with the 
weather or commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it wasn't raining, I was going to bed sleeping at night,  
because I knew we were able to lock in very close to our cost of 
production,'' Baile said.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Hollings, Petty Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLE OF PALMS, S.C. (AP) -- The homes of Sen. Fritz Hollings and  
race car driver Kyle Petty were destroyed in a fire that swept 
through an upscale beach community. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire Friday at Wild Dunes began around sundown in one  
beachfront house, moved to Petty's house then crossed the street to 
Hollings' house. 
</P>
<P>
	``It spread rapidly,'' said Isle of Palms Fire Chief Ann Graham.  
``It was like a firestorm in there. Luckily no one was hurt. The 
property can be replaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials weren't immediately sure what caused the blaze, but  
said it caused millions of dollars worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic senator and his wife, Peatsy, were in the house  
at the time of the fire, but were able to get out safely, said 
Maury Lane, Hollings' spokesman. They were staying with friends in 
Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
	Petty was not at home. Earlier in the day, he qualified 25th for  
the Frontier at the Glen NASCAR Winston Cup race. Petty's publicist 
Chip Williams said Petty was staying at the Watkins Glen 
International race track in New York on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, five houses burned before firefighters got the blaze  
under control, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a massive fire. I've never seen anything like it,''  
said Graham, who has been with the department since 1985. ``If it 
weren't for the cooperation (of other departments), we'd be out 
here for days.''

<HEADLINE> Miller Lite 200 Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ohio (AP) -- Many drivers say the Mid-Ohio Sports Car  
Course is the most physically demanding track on the CART circuit, 
but it will be even more difficult for Mark Blundell in Sunday's 
Miller Lite 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell returned to racing last week at Detroit after missing  
eight events because he broke a vertebra in a May 4 testing 
accident at St. Louis. He said he could wear a neck brace Sunday, 
but discarded it as an option. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like them. They restrict my movement so I'm in a  
little bit of trouble, but don't tell anyone,'' he joked Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm in trouble in terms of strength, but it's just  
fatigue,'' Blundell said. ``I need a certain amount of time to 
recover after being in the car and I know there won't be enough of 
that time between practice Sunday and the race. It definitely won't 
be easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a rough weekend for Blundell. He had the third-fastest  
speed Friday, but failed technical inspection because its skid 
plate was too low. He will be starting last among the 26 drivers 
because wet weather Saturday kept him from posting the kind of 
qualifying time he had Friday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	MILESTONES:@ This will be the 100th start in CART competition  
for Robbie Gordon, one of the few drivers to compete in CART, Indy 
Racing League and NASCAR events. Gordon, in his eighth year in the 
CART series, has two victories and four pole positions in the 
previous 99 events. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other drivers are close to some financial milestones.  
Mauricio Gugelmin needs $49,020 to achieve $4 million in career 
CART earnings, while Paul Tracy is $61,500 away from the $500,000 
mark for this year. Dario Franchitti needs to complete 41 laps to 
reach 5,000 for his career. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	REPLACEMENT REPORT:@ Roberto Moreno qualified 19th for  
Newman-Haas Racing, driving as a replacement for Christian 
Fittipaldi, who was knocked unconscious in an accident Aug. 2 at 
St. Louis and suffered a subdural hematoma -- a collection of blood 
-- on the left side of his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno has become known as the ``supersub'' on the circuit this  
season for his efforts as a replacement driver. He took Blundell's 
place on the PacWest team for eight races, then took over for 
Fittipaldi last week at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno was one of the few drivers attempting to practice during  
Saturday's all-day drizzle and slid off the track on turn 14, 
bumping a tire barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a little bit of excitement today when I went off  
course. Fortunately, the car wasn't damaged too bad. We have a lot 
of work to do tomorrow starting from 19th place, but this team can 
do it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	PJ Jones, who will start 21st, is replacing Adrian Fernandez for  
Patrick Racing after Fernandez broke his wrist in practice at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ROOKIE REPORT:@ Five of the 26 drivers in Sunday's race will be  
making their first appearance at Mid-Ohio. Leading the pack is Juan 
Montoya, who is having one of the most successful rookie years ever 
in the series and is second in the driver standings after holding 
the lead for the previous nine races. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya will start eighth and it will be just the fourth time  
this year that he hasn't started in the top five. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rookies and their positions on the grid are Memo Gidley,  
13th; Cristiano da Matta, 14th; Naoki Hattori, 23rd and Luiz Garcia 
Jr., 24th. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CAMPING CROWD:!@ CART officials say the Mid-Ohio race annually  
draws more campers than any other because of its location in the 
north central Ohio woodlands and the 1,500 spaces it has for 
campers. 
</P>
<P>
	A check of license plates on vehicles parked in the campgrounds  
showed representation from 20 states, including Alaska, as well as 
the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	The track's president, Michelle Trueman Gajoch, said she  
expected all the camping spaces to be filled by Saturday night and 
estimated that campers account for 10 percent of the fans attending 
the Mid-Ohio CART weekend. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SCHOOL SPONSOR:@ Colleges have sponsored cars in major racing  
series before, but Nicolas Rondet's car in the Toyota Atlantic 
series has an elementary and high school as its principal sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The institution is the Harmony School of Bloomington, Ind. Its  
director, Steve Bonchek, said that the school is unlike most others 
because it allows its 250 students considerable freedom in 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	He said sponsoring a race car has been one of the most effective  
ways the 25-year-old school has found to spread its message because 
people are surprised to see an educational organization's name 
listed prominently on a racing vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Some Changes for Bowl Game System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Year Two of the Bowl Championship Series will bring a few new  
wrinkles to the process of selecting the teams to play in its 
national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS made a mostly successful debut last season, with  
Tennessee beating Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl and becoming the 
unanimous choice as the national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the BCS modified its guidelines for selecting teams  
by adding five new computer ratings and toughened eligibility 
standards for its four bowl games. Also, a process is now in place 
that could strip weaker conferences of automatic bids, a move aimed 
at the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
	The BCS standings are determined through four factors: a  
combined ranking in The Associated Press media poll and USA 
Today/ESPN coaches' poll; computer surveys; strength of schedule; 
and won-loss record. 
</P>
<P>
	The series will again use the computer ratings of Jeff Sagarin,  
The New York Times and the Seattle Times. But it also will consider 
Richard Billingsley, Dunkel Index, Kenneth Massey, David Rothman 
and Matthews-Scripps Howard. A school's lowest ranking from the 
eight computer services will be thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
	Champions from the Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC, Atlantic  
Coast and Pac-10 conferences receive automatic bids to the BCS, 
which also includes two at-large teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1-2 teams in the BCS standings are matched in a national  
title game that rotates among the Rose, Sugar, Orange and Fiesta 
bowls. Using a regional format, the other three bowls select the 
remaining conference champions and at-large teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 title game will be held Jan. 4 at the Sugar Bowl in New  
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, teams were eligible for at-large berths with either  
eight victories or by finishing no lower than 12th in the BCS 
standings. Now, teams must have nine regular-season wins over 
Division I-A opponents and at least a No. 12 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, each of the six BCS leagues must show it is worthy of that  
status. If a conference's automatic qualifiers failed to average at 
least a No. 12 BCS rating over a four-year period, it could be 
stripped of the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Big East champion Syracuse (8-4) was 15th in the  
BCS standings and was routed by Florida 31-10 in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the misconceptions of the BCS involved Kansas State,  
which ended up in the Alamo Bowl after losing only one game -- the 
Big 12 championship -- and finishing third in the final BCS 
standings. The feeling was that K-State, which lost to Purdue in 
the Alamo Bowl, deserved to play in a BCS game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still feel the bowls, after you get past the 1-2 game, need  
to have some regional flexibility,'' BCS chairman Roy Kramer said. 
``You can't take two West Coast teams and play in Miami. You've got 
to have regional ties to make the bowls succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first BCS standings will be released Oct. 25.

<HEADLINE> Former AFL-CIO Chief Kirkland Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lane Kirkland, who reunited the major U.S.  
unions during his presidency of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, died 
Saturday of lung cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife Irena said Kirkland died at home nine months after  
being stricken. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland struggled against cancer for many years, losing one  
kidney and part of another to surgeries in the 1970s and '80s. Last 
June, he had a lung claimed removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't suffer at the end,'' said Mrs. Kirkland, his wife of  
26 years. ``His body just gave out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born of southern aristocracy in Camden, S.C., and schooled in  
international relations at Georgetown University, Kirkland bucked 
the stereotypes of union leadership when he was elected AFL-CIO 
president in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics doubted the bespectacled, intellectual with his  
Roosevelt-like cigarette holder could rival his mentor and 
predecessor George Meany, a gruff, cigar-smoking Bronx plumber who 
had dominated the American labor movement for 2 1/2 decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kirkland, hardened at sea in the merchant marine during  
World War II and known for his salty wit, quickly emerged from 
Meany's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed for reunification of the nation's largest and  
best-known unions under the AFL-CIO because, he said, ``all sinners 
belong in the church.'' By 1990 he had brought back the United Auto 
Workers, the Teamsters, the West Coast Longshoremen, Chemical 
Workers, Mine Workers and Locomotive Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please write that he was a great man,'' Mrs. Kirkland said.  
``He was a great man. He did so much for so many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were married the day before the second-term inauguration of  
President Nixon in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kirkland said she had not decided when her husband's  
funeral will be, but it will not be before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland oversaw a massive effort by American workers in the  
1980s to sustain the Polish Solidarity movement. Starting with the 
Gdansk shipyard strike in 1980, U.S. unions smuggled into Poland $6 
million worth of aid, much of it printing and communications 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO under Kirkland reached out to workers in other  
countries where the trade union movement was suppressed, including 
South Africa, China, Cuba and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	A collector of modern paintings and sculpture, avid gardener,  
jazz buff and prolific reader, Kirkland also played political 
hardball. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1981 he organized a march that lured 250,000  
unionists and liberal allies in the civil rights movement to 
Washington to dramatize labor's opposition to Reagan administration 
cuts on a host of social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked once why the AFL-CIO had become so close to the Democratic  
Party, Kirkland replied: ``I've been standing, tippy-toe, waiting 
to be kissed (by the Republican Party), and no one has come 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland pushed for greater representation on the federation's  
top policy-making body of minorities and women. It had been 
historically dominated by white, middle-aged men. 
</P>
<P>
	When Geraldine Ferraro became Walter Mondale's running mate in  
his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984, 
Kirkland bristled at suggestions that union members might not 
support a ticket with a female candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two kinds of people in the labor movement: women,  
and people who like women,'' Kirkland told a caucus of labor 
delegates during the Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland's support for liberal economic policy at home and  
opposition to totalitarianism abroad won him friends at both ends 
of the political spectrum, such as Republican Bob Dole and liberal 
Democrat Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	He was appointed to numerous national commissions, on topics  
including Central America, the structure of the CIA and Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the unions Kirkland helped bring back into the  
AFL-CIO fold, total membership in the federation stayed almost flat 
during his tenure. Union membership declined steadily as a 
percentage of the U.S. labor force. 
</P>
<P>
	The era was beset by crises for unions, from President Reagan's  
firing of striking federal air traffic controllers to declines in 
heavily unionized industries such as manufacturing, mining and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland resigned as AFL-CIO president in August 1995, bowing to  
demands from some leaders of major unions for change. Criticism of 
the AFL-CIO's political activity, organizing and media relations 
was spurred by the Republican takeover of Congress in the 1994 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on March 12, 1922, Joseph Lane Kirkland was heir to a long  
line of Camden cotton growers whose roots date back 200 years to 
the American Revolution. A great-great-grandfather signed the 
Declaration of Causes, in which South Carolina sought to explain 
its secession from the union, and sat in the Confederate Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	When World War II broke out, Kirkland, still a teen-ager,  
enrolled in the first class of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at 
Kings Point, N.Y., and later served as an officer on ships carrying 
ammunition and tanks to battle zones. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, he drew sailing charts for the Navy while going  
to night school at Georgetown, where he studied to enter the 
foreign service and received a bachelor of science degree in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland changed his plans on graduation, however, taking a job  
in the research department at the American Federation of Labor. His 
only previous connection with organized labor was as a member of 
the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, an AFL 
affiliate, during the war years. 
</P>
<P>
	While an AFL-CIO researcher, Kirkland wrote speeches for  
Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson's campaigns in 
1952 and 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the federation in 1958 to do research for the  
International Union of Operating Engineers but rejoined it two 
years later as Meany's executive assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland was elevated in 1969 to AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer,  
the federation's number two job. He was Meany's chosen successor, 
was elected president without opposition in 1979 and went on to 
serve eight two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, President Clinton awarded Kirkland the Presidential  
Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland's marriage to his first wife, with whom he had five  
daughters, ended in divorce. In 1973, he married the former Irena 
Neumann, a Czechoslovakian who survived the Nazi concentration camp 
at Buchenwald. They lived in Washington.

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Alex Bunbury's goal in the 71st  
minute lifted the Kansas City Wizards to a 2-1 victory over New 
York-New Jersey on Saturday night, the MetroStars' seventh straight 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory snapped a two-game losing streak for the Wizards,

	The MetroStars have the worst mark in MLS (5-17 with nine  
points) and fell deeper in the Eastern Conference basement. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars, who have registered just one point out of their  
last possible 42, have won just twice in regulation this season -- 
the last time on May 15. They have scored the fewest goals and 
allowed the most. 
</P>
<P>
	The game-winning goal came after Chris Henderson made a run up  
the left flank and crossed the ball into the box. Bunbury, who was 
being defended by Ramiro Corrales, took the cross down with his 
head and volleyed his shot into the top of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight game the MetroStars scored first and  
also lost a player to a red card in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Sasa Curcic was the player who scored and was later ejected.  
Curcic took a pass from Henry Zambrano at the top left of the box, 
dribbled twice and drilled a shot that Wizards goalkeeper David 
Winner could only knock to the side. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball, however, went off Winner's fingertips, hit the left  
post and bounced back across the line and into the net in the 11th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City, which had not won in three previous trips to Giants  
Stadium, tied it 10 minutes later when Chris Klein ran onto a pass 
from Preki just beyond midfield. Klein carried unchallenged into 
the box and when no defender came after him he beat Mike Ammann 
with a shot to the near post. 
</P>
<P>
	Two minutes later Curcic was red carded by referee Alex Prus for  
taking down Vicente Figueroa and then kicking him. 
</P>
<P>
	MetroStars defender Mike Petke received two yellow cards and was  
ejected in the first half of Wednesday's 4-1 loss to D.C. United.

<HEADLINE> New Computer Is Size of an Aspirin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The latest from the cyberworld: an  
aspirin-size computer that, embedded in household appliances, could 
let people on the road or at the office use the Internet to cool 
their homes, heat coffee and tape TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Believed to be the smallest such computer ever built, the  
inexpensive device could help usher in a new generation of 
connected home appliances, from VCRs to coffee makers to small 
cameras, controlled over the Internet from almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implications of this are more than a silly little  
competition among a bunch of researchers,'' said H. Shrikumar, who 
studies specialized machine automation at the University of 
Massachusetts in Amherst. ``This has tremendous application in the 
way it might change our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project also testifies to how much utility a concise  
programmer can pack into a limited amount of computer memory, even 
in these days of multimegabyte software applications with millions 
of lines of code. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny computer, slightly larger than the head of a match, is  
connected to the Internet from Shrikumar's apartment near the 
university. It includes a tiny 4-megahertz processor he bought for 
49 cents and a small 32-kilobyte memory chip that stores World Wide 
Web pages and other data. 
</P>
<P>
	Although those numbers are paltry compared to the speed and  
storage of modern personal computers, which run thousands of times 
faster and contain hundreds of times more storage, the tiny 
computer still is more powerful than typical computers less than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrikumar, 33, said his computer can be built for less than $1,  
making it practical to install the devices in a variety of home 
electronics and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Some existing appliances, such as modern thermostats or newer  
coffee makers, can be programmed individually. But appliances 
connected using the language of the Internet, called ``TCP/IP,'' 
could communicate with each other even if made by different 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the hour the homeowner sets for his alarm clock, for  
example, the thermostat could automatically turn up the heat, the 
television could turn on the morning news and the coffee could 
begin brewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one click, the whole house now wakes up with you,'' he  
said. ``This can make our way of life much easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, with the appliances connected to a home network that  
also maintained a continuous connection with the Internet, 
consumers could use the Web browser on an office computer to 
program their VCRs, turn on their porch lights, even activate 
cameras to check on the baby sitter. 
</P>
<P>
	The new wave of high-speed Internet connections using cable TV  
modems or new digital phone lines already offer such continuous 
hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I want a computer in my refrigerator that's  
controllable, but the heating system, that's a legitimate one 
you'll want to control,'' said Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap 
Software Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., who built the first small 
Internet computer more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could solve the problem of programming the VCR. You could  
have more sophisticated control mechanisms, have different time 
schedules on the weekdays,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrikumar's Internet computer is smaller than one built earlier  
this year at Stanford University, which includes a much more 
powerful processor and lots more memory. But the Stanford computer 
costs more than $800. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughan Pratt, the Stanford professor in charge of that project,  
said the implications of Shrikumar's work are enormous. 
``Everything that shrinks down to a size that can be embedded in 
small spaces will have a big impact,'' Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Shrikumar began testing his computer this summer, and  
after he announced it on a private Internet discussion group, about 
5,000 people daily from around 70 countries have visited the tiny 
computer's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was just a fun hobby project,'' said Shrikumar, who  
expects to graduate next year. ``It caught my attention and 
demanded that it be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is not sure what he will do once he leaves school.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of things one can do,'' he said. ``It's a big  
world.''

<HEADLINE> Iowa Poll Could Shape GOP Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Under carnival tents filled with free food and  
music, Republican presidential candidates courted Iowa voters 
Saturday in an informal poll that could reshape the GOP field. 
George W. Bush sought to solidify his standing as front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor and eight other White House hopefuls poured  
millions of dollars and spent hundreds of hours in this initial 
caucus state to test the potency of their political operations. One 
candidate, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, called the non-binding poll 
a ``sham'' and refused to go. 
</P>
<P>
	A confidant Bush, introducing his wife Laura as ``the next first  
lady of the United States,'' told supporters at the bank of a 
fishing hole outside Ames, ``I think we're going to send a pretty 
clear signal today that our party is going to welcome new faces and 
voices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and millionaire conservative Steve Forbes spent the most  
money, raising expectations for a battle for first place. Bush 
aides said a late surge of support gave them hope for a big 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole and Lamar Alexander needed strong showings to  
remain viable as potential alternatives to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Television commentator Pat Buchanan, Washington activist Gary  
Bauer, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, radio broadcaster Alan Keyes and 
former Vice President Dan Quayle struggled to emerge as the 
strongest social conservative candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The straw poll is a pay-to-vote staple of Iowa politics, a party  
fund-raiser that looks more like a state fair. Barbecue fumes 
wafted from tent to tent, as country music stars and other 
celebrities entertained supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole crisscrossed the state by airplane to oversee the boarding  
of buses by supporters making the trek to central Iowa. ``As people 
are boarding the buses, I'm expressing my thanks and appreciation 
for their support, and I'm telling them we're going to make 
history,'' Dole, who hopes to be the nation's first female 
president, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Though no straw poll winner ever has won the GOP nomination, the  
contest has helped and hurt any number of candidacies ahead of the 
first real votes, the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	All nine combatants in the 1999 poll had much at stake. For a  
few, it might be their last gasp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sought a convincing victory to further distance himself  
from the pack with time running out on his rivals. He competed at 
the risk of tarnishing his image as the GOP's best vote-getter, the 
man most likely to win a general election. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes hoped to prove that he could convert his money, message  
and tireless work into an impressive number of votes. If he could 
not do it in a money-driven straw poll, questions were certain to 
be asked about his prospects down the line. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander needed to finish in the first four places to avoid  
dropping out of his second presidential race, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole draws huge crowds stocked with young and  
professional women. The poll was a test of whether they were 
serious political supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer scoured a network of churches and plumbed his contacts in  
the home-schooling community. He was the candidate that worried the 
other campaigns the most, because his support was hard to gauge. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan taunted the GOP establishment with insurgent campaigns  
in 1992 and 1996. He needed a strong showing to energize his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes is not a threat to win the nomination, but did well in the  
last straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, a late-entry to the field, looked for a jump start from  
the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle set his expectations low for Saturday, but knew that  
finishing behind lesser-known conservatives would cause political 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, Vice President Gore and former Sen. Bill  
Bradley, who both were in Iowa during the week, took a campaign 
break Saturday.

<HEADLINE> 6 Algerians Killed in Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- A bomb exploded near Algeria's  
northeastern border with Tunisia, killing four motorists, and a 
separate attack in Algiers left two shopkeepers dead, local 
newspapers reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The shopkeepers, brothers who ran a wholesale candy business,  
had their throats slit early Friday inside one of their stores, the 
Liberte newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also reported that a bomb exploded as a funeral  
procession was heading toward a cemetery Friday in a village not 
far from Tebessa, near the border with Tunisia. The bomb killed 
four people traveling together in one vehicle, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Algerian security officials on Thursday managed to defuse a bomb  
hidden under train tracks linking Mohammadia and Said in western 
Algeria, the Oran Daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault on the shopkeepers in Algiers was the second attack  
in the Algerian capital during the week. On Monday, a bomb ripped 
through a crowded neighborhood, injuring one person. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody claimed responsibility for the attacks, which are usually  
blamed on Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths were the latest in a violent insurgency that began in  
Algeria in 1992 after the military-backed government canceled 
elections the Islamic Salvation Front was set to win. An estimated 
100,000 people have been killed since the insurgency began. 
</P>
<P>
	Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has promised to seek  
reconciliation, but since his election in April, his government has 
failed to halt the violence.

<HEADLINE> Motley Crue Singer Sues Rocketdyne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Motley Crue lead singer Vince Neil is suing  
Rocketdyne, a rocket engine test site and a former home to nuclear 
reactors, over the mysterious cancer death of his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court claims  
Rocketdyne deliberately dumped toxic fuels on property adjacent to 
Neil's former Simi Valley home, said David Cordrey, Neil's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, 4-year-old Skylar Neil died of liver cancer. Workers  
and residents in the area have been pursuing claims over an alleged 
increased rate of cancer at the plant and in the area, Cordrey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm stunned to learn about the things Rocketdyne did,'' said  
Neil, whose lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. ``I am prepared to 
fight for my child since she no longer can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A telephone call to Rocketdyne by The Associated Press seeking  
comment Saturday wasn't immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordrey said Skylar's cancer was very rare and the cause was  
unknown. She underwent several operations and radiation treatment. 
Medical expenses were almost $2 million, Cordrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocketdyne ran 10 nuclear reactors at its Santa Susana Field  
Laboratory, 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles, from the 1950s to 
the 1980s. There were several accidents, including a partial fuel 
meltdown in 1959. Nuclear research was halted in 1989 but rocket 
engine and fuel tests continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The company was sold to Boeing in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Looks To Repeat As Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tee Martin hadn't even made it home from  
the Fiesta Bowl last January when he was asked The Question: Can 
the Volunteers repeat as national champions? 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Man, just let me enjoy this one first,''' the  
quarterback said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Phillip Fulmer barely had his headset off after Tennessee  
won the title when he was asked the same question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to know if we're going to do it again,'' he  
said. ``It was almost like I didn't have time to enjoy winning a 
national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yep, time's up.  
</P>
<P>
	With the new season upon them, the Vols face the pressure of  
trying to defend the crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard last year and it'll be even harder this year,''  
said Martin, entering his senior season. ``They'll know what to 
prepare for. They'll have a whole year of film on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's quest for a repeat begins when Wyoming comes to  
Knoxville on Sept. 4. Two weeks later they travel to Gainesville -- 
where they last won in 1971 -- for the annual showdown with Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	To defend their two consecutive Southeastern Conference titles  
the Vols must get by the Gators and up-and-coming Georgia in the 
SEC Eastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, ranked No. 2 in The Associated Press preseason poll,  
also has to go to Alabama and Arkansas, and will be home against 
Auburn, Georgia and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awful hard to go undefeated if you play a reasonable  
schedule,'' said Fulmer, whose team was 13-0 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The most glaring graduation losses from last year's team are  
big-play receiver Peerless Price; middle linebacker Al Wilson, the 
heart and soul of the defense; and reliable placekicker Jeff Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	But if games are won and lost in the trenches, as most coaches  
insist they are, the Vols start the season in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this could be the best offensive line I've seen at  
Tennessee, and without question it should be the best defensive 
line,'' said Fulmer, an offensive lineman in his playing days and 
former offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
	On offense, guard Cosey Coleman, tackle Chad Clifton and center  
Spencer Riley are returning starters. Coleman, a 6-foot-5, 
315-pound junior and third-year starter, is widely considered one 
of the best Tennessee has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Tucker played a lot last year and is penciled in at the  
tackle opposite Clifton. Toby Champion and converted defensive 
lineman Fred Weary are expected to battle it out for the other 
guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
	On defense the Vols return starters Shaun Ellis at end and  
tackles Billy Ratliff and Darwin Walker. Will Overstreet 
contributed at the other end last year and also is back. 
</P>
<P>
	A player everyone is watching is big (6-7, 280 pounds) tackle  
John Henderson, who couldn't play last year as a partial academic 
qualifier but made his presence felt in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer has always stressed speed, and the Vols have plenty of  
it, plus experience, at the skill positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin matured tremendously in his first season as a starter. He  
was brought along slowly but still put up respectable numbers: 153 
completions in 267 attempts (57 percent) for 2,164 yards, with 19 
touchdowns and six interceptions, including an NCAA-record 
23-for-24 performance against South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he realizes there's a long season ahead and the  
success of last year will only make the Vols everybody's No. 1 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't be satisfied with what we won last year. We  
understand what it took to win 13 games and we're ready to do it 
again,'' he said. ``It's time to show what we can do, not talk 
about what we did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamal Lewis, who had the sixth-highest freshman rushing total in  
NCAA history two seasons ago (1,367 yards), returns at tailback 
after missing all but four games last year with a knee injury. He 
was averaging 124 yards a game until he got hurt against Auburn on 
Oct. 3, and by all accounts his rehabilitation has gone well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' Lewis said. ``My speed is great, my agility is  
there. I'm ready to go win some football games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' replacements developed into reliable players. Travis  
Henry finished the season with 970 yards rushing and Travis 
Stephens added 477. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Crosby and Will Bartholomew are both good blockers at  
fullback, although neither has anywhere near the speed of the 
departed Shawn Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Price is a major concern. His big-play ability was  
critical to the Vols' success in '98, as demonstrated by his MVP 
performance in the 23-16 Fiesta Bowl victory over Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	The only returning receiver with significant experience is  
Cedrick Wilson, who is neither as big (5-10, 175) nor as fast as 
Price. But he is tough and averaged 17 yards on 33 catches last 
year, nearly 2 yards a catch better than Price. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Erik Parker has shown promise when he's been healthy.  
Freshman Leonard Scott is one of the fastest players in the country 
-- he's the NCAA 60-meter track champion -- and junior David Martin 
has the size (6-4, 210) to make himself an inviting target. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Wilson's vocal leadership at middle linebacker is as  
much a priority as replacing his talent. Dominique Stevenson and 
Bernard Jackson are good athletes, but neither has significant 
experience in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	At outside linebacker, Raynoch Thompson is one of the best in  
the country and Eric Westmoreland is solid, especially in pass 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive backfield returns three starters: Dwayne Goodrich  
at cornerback and safeties Deon Grant and Fred White. Junior Andre 
Lott will be at the other corner. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leverton returns as the punter.  
</P>
<P>
	Finding a reliable replacement for Hall is key. His clutch late  
field goals beat Syracuse and Florida to get the Vols off to a 2-0 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior walk-on Robert Loudermilk is the presumptive starter, but  
freshman Stephen Lee could work his way into the job if he's as 
good as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer, who was rewarded with a six-year, $6 million contract  
before the Fiesta Bowl, realizes talent alone won't win another 
national title. It takes a lot of work and a little luck, which the 
Vols got their share of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he's happy to be where he is.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like the expectations and I like to rise to those  
expectations,'' Fulmer said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Only 3 States Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Only Iowa, Nebraska and North Dakota  
have completely tested their computer systems and are ready to face 
the new year without fear of potentially dangerous Year 2000 
glitches, according to a federal report released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the states have only 139 days to guarantee  
reliability of their systems that run everything from law 
enforcement agencies to utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can predict what might, or might not, happen once the  
clock ticks past midnight this New Year's Eve,'' said Rep. Stephen 
Horn, R-Calif. ``The only certainty is that this Jan. 1 deadline 
cannot be extended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, was released at a congressional subcommittee 
hearing held in Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	While all 50 states have some type of plan in place, most said  
they won't be fully ready until next month and 14 states said their 
deadline to have all systems tested isn't until October or later. 
</P>
<P>
	``States are facing an extremely busy next few months to get  
themselves ready,'' said Joel Willemssen, director of the U.S. 
Civil Agencies Information Systems. ``Important progress has been 
made, but much work remains to avoid disruption of critical 
services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K problem involves older computers that recognize only the  
last two digits of a year and could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 
rather than 2000. In some cases, that confusion could cause 
computers to malfunction or break down, potentially causing power 
outages, air transportation delays, delayed tax refunds, failed 
medical devices and other disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	While most states lag in preparedness, the Silicon Valley  
companies that are greatly responsible for the computer chips used 
in so many systems told the committee they are ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have one of the best Y2K programs in our  
industry,'' said Hewlett-Packard Co. marketing manager Brad 
Whitworth. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitworth said HP, the world's second largest computer vendor,  
has spent three years and $250 million on internal efforts to avoid 
Y2K problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel Corp. government affairs manager Richard Hall said that  
company's internal review, completed just 10 days ago, showed that 
100 percent of its critical applications are Year 2000 capable. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Intel's biggest concern is that public power, water,  
telecommunications and transportation could halt at some of its 
overseas facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also has been working with local and state agencies to  
make sure utilities and other services will be working at its Santa 
Clara, Calif., headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has reason to worry, according to the GAO report.  
</P>
<P>
	Although California's periodic earthquakes already test many  
emergency systems, key computer systems that would be used in 
catastrophes have not been tested for Y2K problems, said the 
report.

<HEADLINE> Library Compiles 20th Cent. Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like a century's-end time capsule, the Library  
of Congress is gathering examples of scenes, sights and events of 
everyday America as a testament to the country's uniqueness. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a world where Green Bay Packer fans bare their chests  
against Wisconsin's wicked winter wind. Marchers honor the lowly 
peanut in Alabama and sweet corn in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	These and similarly disparate events were suggested by members  
of Congress and representatives of U.S. territories, asked by the 
library to propose subjects for the collection. 
</P>
<P>
	James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, said the project  
``celebrates, and shares with the nation, the grass-roots 
creativity of every part of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tied to the Library of Congress' 200th birthday next year, the  
project, called ``Local Legacies,'' also will include a selection 
of poetry chosen with the help of more than 19,000 Americans and a 
video of President Clinton reading from a poem about the American 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The library's assembled material will join the 115 million  
books, films, software and other items in the world's largest 
collection of official records. 
</P>
<P>
	From Rep. Mark Green, R-Wis., whose district includes Green Bay,  
came the Packers idea. Green is a lifelong fan and a covered-chest 
season ticket holder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Towards the end of the season, in December and January, it  
gets down to 30 or 40 below zero, what with the wind-chill factor, 
and some of the fans have imbibed a lot of adult beverages,'' Green 
said. ``They take off their coats and shirts, their chests spell 
out the word `Packers' and get very red.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., offered three projects,  
including a celebration at Mendota, Ill., that honors sweet corn 
with a fair and parade. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala, suggested the National Peanut  
Festival, held annually for 56 years in Dothan, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	It celebrates a crop that fed Africans aboard slave ships coming  
to America but, thanks largely to George Washington Carver, who was 
born a slave, ranks with cotton among the South's leading crops. 
Carver developed more than 300 products, from flour to fertilizer, 
that can be produced from peanuts and sweet potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the poetry contributions, poet laureate Robert Pinsky  
will present the library with 50 videos of Americans reading their 
favorite poems. Readers include Clinton, who recites Ralph Waldo 
Emerson's ``Concord Hymn'' on the 50th anniversary of the first 
engagement in the American Revolution: 
</P>
<P>
	``Here once the embattled farmers stood  
</P>
<P>
	``And fired the shot heard round the world.''  
</P>
<P>
	Proposers must submit their local legacy projects by year's end,  
although Pinsky's will take much longer to complete. Over the past 
16 months he has collected favorite poems chosen by nonpoets from 
sixth-graders up. 
</P>
<P>
	``With close to 20,000 submissions from every state of the  
union, all ages and professions from circus acrobat to accountant, 
the evidence is there that many Americans love poetry,'' Pinsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He will pick 200 video and 1,000 audio recordings to be  
deposited in the library to join more than 2,000 others in the 
library's archives of recorded poetry and literature.

<HEADLINE>  Colombians Mourn Slain Comic Garzon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Thousands of Colombians filed past the  
open casket of slain comic Jaime Garzon Saturday as a nation in 
shock mourned the loss of its best-loved political satirist. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon, 38, was killed Friday, shot as he drove to work at a  
Bogota radio station. The slaying stunned a country long numbed to 
political violence and raised fears that Colombia's civil conflict 
is spiraling out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists called on Colombians to turn out by the millions for  
marches demanding an end to a dirty war that pits right-wing 
paramilitary groups against leftist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon, apparently the war's latest victim, had worked as an  
intermediary to release hostages held by leftist rebels and had 
been active in local elections. But he was best known for his 
television and radio shows, where he displayed the biting humor 
that always demonstrated his affinity for the downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people loved him a great deal. ... The man who was their  
voice has been murdered,'' said Garzon's sister, Marisol. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's newspapers dedicated entire pages to the comic whose  
caustic wit often targeted the corruption and vanity of the rich 
and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
	In one telephone prank, Garzon -- impersonating ex-president  
Ernesto Samper -- told a government aide that he was to be named as 
a government minister the next day. The official didn't realize he 
had been fooled until after he had made his children dress up for 
the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon was shot as he drove to work at Radionet, the all-news  
network where he was a morning show co-host. He was killed almost 
instantly by five shots fired into his head and chest by a gunman 
who approached his car while he was stopped at a red light, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Colleagues and relatives said Garzon had often told them of  
receiving death threats from right-wing paramilitary militias. 
Garzon's sister said he had become more careful about his movements 
lately, although he refused bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said that if it had to happen, then it had to happen,  
period,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several radio stations received anonymous claims of  
responsibility from callers who said they represented paramilitary 
groups. But the radio network Caracol received a statement signed 
by the paramilitary umbrella group, the United Self-Defense Forces 
of Colombia, denying responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the radio station, paramilitary chief Carlos  
Castana said he had planned to meet with Garzon on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, Garzon had also met leftist rebels to help  
facilitate the release of kidnap victims. On Friday, he had been 
scheduled to meet with leaders of the National Liberation Army, 
Colombia's second-largest rebel group, to help negotiate the 
release of civilian hostages held by the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon is survived by his girlfriend, his mother, two brothers  
and a sister.

<HEADLINE> ACLU May Sue Over Evolution Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union says  
school districts could face lawsuits if they attempt to teach 
creationism in wake of the state school board's recent decision to 
de-emphasize the teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU, in a letter Friday to school superintendents, warned  
the districts about adopting ``religiously-based standards'' in 
teaching science. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU also noted U.S. Supreme Court decisions that forbid the  
teaching of creationism, the belief that a higher power created the 
universe, because of its religious foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	People for the American Way and Americans United for the  
Separation of Church and States also said they would consider 
lawsuits if religion-based standards were implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	The board adopted new testing standards Wednesday that play down  
the scientific importance of evolution, particularly the theory 
that humans descended from apes and other lower species. 
</P>
<P>
	Local school districts will continue to decide what subjects are  
taught in their classrooms, but critics and supporters of the new 
standards think they could influence some districts' lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the new standards said the criticism was like  
running and yelling, ``The sky is falling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be frankly surprised if any district throws evolution  
out,'' said Linda Holloway, the chairwoman of the state board. 
``That is certainly not my intent. I have no problem with the 
teaching of evolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some, including Gov. Bill Graves, say the board's decision has  
embarrassed the state. Governor's spokesman Mike Matson said Graves 
received about 200 e-mails the day after the new standards were 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	A man from Minnesota wrote that he would ``add the state of  
Kansas to my list of places I will not visit because of the 
apparent declining intelligence of the population.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graves also said the decision was ``so out of sync with  
reality'' that it minimized the board's credibility. Some lawmakers 
now are talking about abolishing the board or stripping it of 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an issue in the legislative session,''  
Graves, a moderate Republican, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators say the controversy over evolution could create  
support for changes that have been sought for years by lawmakers in 
both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably, the right wing did us a favor,'' said Senate  
President Dick Bond, also a moderate Republican. ``We ought to send 
them a thank-you note. Maybe we can get change now.''

<HEADLINE> Jaguars Sign FB Tim Lester </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars plucked  
another free agent out of Pittsburgh on Saturday, signing fullback 
Tim Lester to a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester gives the Jaguars depth at a position where they had only  
one experienced veteran, third-year player Daimon Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester, a seven-year veteran, spent the last four seasons with  
Pittsburgh and was the lead blocker for Jerome Bettis. Lester joins 
former Steeler Carnell Lake, one of the first free agents the 
Jaguars signed in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis said he would be upset if the Steelers let Lester become  
a free agent, but Pittsburgh did just that, adding yet another 
proven veteran to a long list of free agents that got away. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven seasons split between the Steelers and the Rams, the  
5-foot-10, 233-pound fullback out of Eastern Kentucky had only 33 
carries. He played in just nine games last year after injuring a 
shoulder. He caught nine passes, but didn't carry the ball once. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars, however, don't ask their fullback to carry the  
ball, only to block for Fred Taylor, who rushed for 1,223 yards 
behind Shelton's blocking last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lester is expected to come in and compete for Shelton's spot.  
Rookie Trevor Bollers and second-year player Matt Calhoun, both 
long shots to make the team, are the only other fullbacks on 
Jacksonville's preseason roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial details of Lester's one-year deal were not released by  
the Jaguars.

<HEADLINE> Houston Waits for 2nd NFL Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- For one more month, all Houston businessman Bob  
McNair can do is sit and wait. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair has put together a strong package to entice the National  
Football League back to Houston, including $195 million in public 
money for a $310 million retractable-roof stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he awaits a Sept. 15 NFL deadline to see if Los Angeles, the  
league's first choice for a new team, can put together a stadium 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles was awarded the 32nd NFL franchise in March  
contingent on coming up with an acceptable stadium and financing 
plan. So far, it hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try not to be too excited because the deadline is Sept. 15  
and anything can happen between now and then but as the days pass, 
there is less and less opportunity for something to happen (in Los 
Angeles),'' McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Los Angeles is still uncertain on a site for the new  
franchise, Houston's plans are set. The new stadium, including 
plenty of new parking, would be built adjacent to the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	If Los Angeles finds a way to make the NFL happy, McNair plans  
to start wooing other franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd immediately start talking to other teams,'' McNair said.  
``All you have to do is look at the facts. There are some teams 
with unsatisfactory stadium arrangements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNair is sure Houston has a ``super climate'' for football --  
fans were always behind the Oilers before owner Bud Adams ditched 
them for a taxpayer-funded deal in Tennessee, leaving the city 
without pro football for the first time in 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is taking a second look at previously rejected stadium  
sites in Los Angeles after the Los Angeles Coliseum had been the 
sole focus of efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston officials say the indecision is promising for them.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a clear indication that the NFL is facing the  
reality of the situation at the Coliseum,'' Houston Sports 
Authority chairman Jack Rains said. ``They looked at those first 
and selected the Coliseum. Now they're looking at the discards.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger a Contender in Golf's Majors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Tiger Woods has become a man for all  
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	He almost won the U.S. Open. He could have won the British Open.  
And the way he has played the first two rounds at Medinah Country 
Club, he might win the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only place Woods no longer seems to be a factor on  
Sunday is Augusta National, where his 1997 victory was so dominant 
he will be a favorite every time he drives down Magnolia Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``My game has improved so much,'' Woods said. ``Every shot in my  
bag has gotten better, and that's just because of maturity and more 
experience and a lot more practice. And hopefully, down the road I 
can say I'm a better player than I am now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Better now than he was two years ago?  
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the Western Open in 1997 was his sixth on the PGA  
Tour, including the Masters. Since then, he has won four times in 
America and still hasn't bagged another major. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just watch me,'' Woods often says, an invitation to see the  
difference in his game, obvious in the consistency more than the 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He used to be a classic case of feast or famine. Sure, he won  
the Masters by a record 12 strokes, but he often found himself 12 
strokes out of the lead in a major come Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's no longer the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Even in the Masters, where he tied for 18th, he was only five  
strokes behind going into the final round. Woods has failed to 
finish outside the top 20 only two times in 16 tournaments this 
year. Since returning from his post-Masters break, Woods has won 
three times and finished no worse than seventh in the other three 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	All he needs now is another major. All Woods keeps doing is  
giving himself a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always disappointed when I don't win a major,'' he said.  
``I was disappointed last year. But realistically, you're not going 
to win one every year. The greatest players have never done that. 
All you can ask is to give yourself opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are only four a year,'' he said. ``If you can somehow  
have a chance to win on the back nine Sunday on each and every one, 
I figure for the rest of my life I would have a few of them in my 
pocket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is not indifferent about the majors. Just the opposite.  
While his game is more complete, allowing him to choose between 
power or control, his passion has never been stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Am I putting less pressure on myself? No, same amount,'' he  
said. ``It's just I'm a better player. I'm hitting the shots 
better. I'm a better driver of the golf ball. My whole game is 
better. And because of that, it tends to make you outwardly a 
little bit more at ease. 
</P>
<P>
	``But inside,'' he said, ``it's a different story.''  
</P>
<P>
	It is a different story outside as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Woods has added savvy to his skill. He has gone through an  
overhaul of his swing plane, giving him a better chance of 
controlling the ball flight and the distance. He constantly works 
on his short game. He hits driver when it makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say Woods has become more cautious. Woods only says he has  
gotten better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always had a good game plan,'' he said. ``I just could  
never really execute them. If you can't execute your game plan, 
you're going to look like you can't play the game. You look 
aggressive or too conservative. I know what I want to do, it's just 
sometimes I really can't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has done everything right this year except win a major. The  
PGA Championship represents the last chance of the 20th century for 
him to win his second major. There figures to be many more to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a handful of guys who threaten every major,'' Jay  
Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is one of them. Jack Nicklaus was the best at it.  
</P>
<P>
	When he was a kid, Woods kept a chart of everything Nicklaus  
accomplished, from his two U.S. Amateur titles to his 18 
professional majors. But Woods knows that Nicklaus' greatness goes 
beyond all the majors he won. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack finished second in 19 majors,'' he said. ``How did he  
feel about it, losing that many times? But he also won 18. The key 
is to keep giving yourself enough chances. Eventually, you're going 
to win a few.''

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Likely To Close Mich. Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- The city's mayor says he expects  
Kellogg Co. to close the aging southern part of its hometown cereal 
plant, cutting as many as 700 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Ted Dearing said Kellogg officials contacted him Friday  
and told him to expect an announcement today concerning the 
company's South Plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, I am confident they will close the plant,''  
Dearing said. ``But I think people are prepared for it. They've had 
60 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Company and union officials declined to comment when contacted  
about the plant's fate this morning. A closure could affect as many 
as 700 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg announced in June it was considering closing the aging  
South Plant, parts of which date to the 1900s, to save an estimated 
$35 million to $45 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg is the world's top manufacturer of ready-to-eat cereals,  
but its annual earnings dropped 21 percent last year. The company 
has been hurt by competition from cheaper, store-brand cereals, as 
well as market-wide demographic changes.

<HEADLINE> Cheap Oil Imports Irk US Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Back when Americans were coping with the  
energy crisis, the idea that there could someday be a trade 
complaint against cheap oil imports would have gotten anyone 
laughed out of the line at the gasoline pump. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's just been one, the charge by small U.S. producers  
that four exporting nations dumped cut-rate oil on the market in 
violation of American trade laws, depressing their prices and 
crippling their business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department dismissed their case on Monday. By the  
time it was filed, the market had turned up, after two years of 
plunging prices. 
</P>
<P>
	World prices, which slumped because of slackening demand and  
overflow supplies, have been increasing. The Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on production curbs to push up 
prices. Demand is going up, too, and the Energy Department expects 
higher world oil prices to hold for the rest of this year and all 
of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris-based International Energy Agency says the oil glut of  
1998 is yielding to tightening markets in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, U.S. oil imports are expected to increase.  
Twenty-five years ago, when the Arab oil embargo choked supplies, 
led to those lines at the gasoline pump and sent prices up four 
times over, oil imports accounted for 36 percent of U.S. 
consumption. President Nixon said the United States should produce 
and conserve its way to energy self-sufficiency by 1980. Instead, 
imports went up, past 40 percent when President Carter declared the 
moral equivalent of war against the energy crisis of the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservation efforts begun in that era have made the nation more  
energy efficient. But demand, and diminishing domestic production, 
have made it more reliant on imports. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Congress voted to declare that 50 percent dependence on  
imported oil was the peril point for national security. Four years 
later, imports exceeded half of U.S. use for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimate now is 56 percent, and increasing. According to the  
Energy Department, net imports could account for nearly 70 percent 
of U.S. consumption by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	No crisis, though, so no issue, except for the complaint of the  
small oilmen and their congressional allies, who want legislation 
to help them stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
	There are House and Senate bills to do it with tax breaks and  
other incentives. A $246 million tax break for small producers is 
part of the Republican tax cut, passed by Congress but bound for a 
veto when it gets to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	By Energy Department estimate, U.S. oil consumption is expected  
to increase by nearly 3 percent this year and next. But domestic 
oil production is forecast to decline by 3.7 percent this year and 
an additional 1.1 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent producers who lodged the cheap oil complaint  
argued that Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Iraq had been 
dumping cheap oil in violation of U.S. trade laws, at the expense 
of their business. The group called Save Domestic Oil Inc. sought 
to trigger anti-dumping laws, which could have led to steep tariffs 
on about 60 percent of the oil imported into the United States. It 
was rejected for lack of broad support in the oil industry; and 
while the independent group said it would appeal, that would take 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute, representing major producers,  
had opposed the trade move by the independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that low world oil prices have seriously  
harmed U.S. producers, their workers and related industries,'' the 
API said after the case was dismissed. ``Many thousands of people 
have lost their jobs and many firms have been shut down. But these 
low prices were set by the forces of supply and demand in 
international markets, not by alleged unfair pricing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those markets can pump prices up, too.  
</P>
<P>
	That's been the more customary American complaint about foreign  
producers. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hall of Famer Pee Weese Dead at 81 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pee Wee Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop and  
Brooklyn Dodgers captain who smoothed Jackie Robinson's entry into 
major league baseball as its first black player, died Saturday. He 
was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Dodgers confirmed Reese's death. It was not  
immediately known where the Kentucky native died or the cause of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags at Dodger Stadium were flown at half-staff for Saturday  
night's game against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese, who overcame prostate cancer years ago, underwent  
radiation treatment for lung cancer in March 1997 after doctors 
removed a malignant tumor. He also was recovering from a broken hip 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-time All-Star, Reese led the Dodgers to seven National  
League pennants and helped Brooklyn win its only World Series 
championship in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed ``The Little Colonel,'' he batted .269 in a career  
that spanned 1940-58 and included the Dodgers' first year in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	But his offensive career totals -- 126 home runs, 885 RBIs -- did  
not begin to measure the value of Harold Henry Reese to the 
Dodgers, or to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his calm leadership, sure-handed fielding and clutch  
hits, Reese played a key role in easing Robinson's road into the 
majors in 1947.

<HEADLINE> Stone Temple Pilots Singer Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stone Temple Pilots lead singer Scott Weiland  
is back in jail because of illegal drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	The rock star had been on probation, receiving outpatient  
treatment for drug addiction, but in July he received hospital 
treatment for a heroin overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland was sent to jail ``to show that this will not be  
tolerated ... (and) to help him make up his mind to stop killing 
himself,'' Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland was taken to the hospital ward at the Los Angeles County  
Men's Central Jail. His next court date is Sept. 5. He had wanted 
to be sent to a court-ordered drug program, but the judge noted 
that hadn't worked previously. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer was arrested in 1995 for possession of cocaine and  
heroin in Pasadena. Charges were dropped in exchange for completing 
a diversion program but he was arrested again in 1997 and pleaded 
guilty to heroin possession last summer. He was later kicked out of 
a rehabilitation program in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, he also pleaded guilty to drug possession in New  
York.

<HEADLINE> Black Veterans Seeking Pardon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of black World War II veterans wants  
President Clinton to clear the names of 50 black sailors 
court-martialed after an ammunition explosion 55 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, please hear us,'' said veteran Yale Lewis of  
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to stick with this until we get some results,''  
added Harry J. Baker, president of the World War II Black Navy 
Veterans of Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization held a wreath-laying ceremony Friday for the  
black sailors, who were court-martialed for mutiny for refusing to 
return to the loading docks after the July 1944 blast at the Port 
Chicago Naval Magazine near San Francisco that killed 320 men. 
</P>
<P>
	The black veterans are just the latest group to call for the  
men's pardons. Last month, the NAACP passed a resolution asking 
Clinton to pardon the sailors. 
</P>
<P>
	There are two known surviving members of the sailors who were  
convicted and imprisoned. Supporters have asked for a speedy review 
because one of the sailors, Freddie Meeks of California, is in 
failing health. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said the matter was under review.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's being considered under the usual process at the Justice  
Department, and obviously the president will give careful 
consideration to that,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of those killed were members of the all-black loading  
crews that stacked bombs and other explosives aboard Navy ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion was the worst domestic loss of life in World War  
II. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 Navy legal review concluded that the black seamen faced  
racial prejudice but found no grounds to overturn their 
courts-martial.

	Anti-Milosevic Sentiments Grow  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the wake of NATO's bombing  
campaign against Yugoslavia, pressure on President Slobodan 
Milosevic to resign has been growing by the day. In comments 
published today, the newly named vice premier in Yugoslavia, 
Tomislav Nikolic -- appointed as part of a government reshuffle 
meant to strengthen Milosevic -- called for the president's 
resignation. He was quoted in an interview with the German Der 
Spiegel magazine as saying Milosevic should resign ``not because 
the West demands it, but rather because he capitulated in Kosovo.'' 
Meanwhile, forensics experts examined a grave site today near the 
southeastern town of Gnjilane thought to contain more victims of 
the Kosovo crackdown.

	Iowa Poll Could Shape GOP Field  
</P>
<P>
	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential candidates courted  
Iowa voters with free food and music today in an informal poll that 
could reshape the GOP field. Nine White House hopefuls poured 
millions of dollars and spent hundreds of hours in this initial 
caucus state to test the potency of their political operations. One 
candidate, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, called the non-binding poll 
a ``sham'' and refused to go. Texas Governor George W. Bush sought 
a convincing victory to further distance himself from the pack, 
though he competes at the risk of tarnishing his image as the GOP's 
candidate that is most likely to win a general election. No straw 
poll winner ever has won the GOP nomination. As many as 20,000 
people are expected to participate.

	Report: Protesters Sentenced To Die  
</P>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary  
Court reportedly has condemned to death instigators of last month's 
mass protests, Iran's worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic 
revolution. The evening Kayhan daily, which is believed to have 
close ties to Iran's hard-line judiciary, quoted ``informed 
sources'' today, but the story has not been confirmed. The mass 
protests, which highlighted the struggle between reformists and 
conservatives in the government, were sparked by the police's 
storming of a Tehran University dormitory on July 9 after students 
objected to the banning of a reformist newspaper. The raid left one 
person dead and others injured.

have completely tested their computer systems and are ready to face 
the new year without fear of potentially dangerous Year 2000 
glitches, according to a federal report released today. The rest of 
the states have only 139 days to guarantee reliability of their 
systems that run everything from law enforcement agencies to 
utilities. The report by the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, was released at a congressional

	Kellogg Closes Historic Mich. Plant  
</P>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co. today announced it would  
close most of its historic hometown plant and cut about 550 jobs in 
its latest effort to revive a sagging bottom line. The decision is 
a heavy blow to this city, where the scent of freshly baked cereal 
often permeates the air and generations of families have banked on 
jobs with the company. The closure is the latest change at the 
financially troubled company, whose annual earnings dropped 21 
percent last year. The company has been hurt by competition from 
cheaper, store-brand cereals, as well as the fact that fewer 
Americans are eating cereal in the morning, preferring convenience 
foods that can be eaten on the run, like bagels, instead.

	Former AFL-CIO Chief Kirkland Dies

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lane Kirkland, who reunited the major U.S.  
unions during his presidency of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, died 
today of lung cancer. He was 77. Kirkland struggled against cancer 
for many years, losing one kidney and part of another to surgeries 
in the 1970s and '80s. He appealed for reunification of the 
nation's largest and best-known unions under the AFL-CIO because, 
he said, ``all sinners belong in the church.'' By 1990 he had 
brought back the United Auto Workers, the Teamsters, the West Coast 
Longshoremen, Chemical Workers, Mine Workers and Locomotive 
Engineers.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire caught up with last year's home  
run record pace with No. 47 and Sammy Sosa hit his 44th today as 
the Chicago Cubs beat the St. Louis Cardinals 9-7. Last year, Big 
Mac and Slammin' Sammy homered on the same day 21 times as McGwire 
finished with a record 70 and Sosa also broke Roger Maris' 
37-year-old record with 66. With a sellout crowd of 48,615 on its 
feet in the third, McGwire homered for the third time in two games. 
His homer off Cubs rookie left-hander Micah Bowie tied Eddie Murray 
for 15th place on the career list at 504 and hiked his NL-leading 
RBI total to 110.

<HEADLINE> Father, Son Make NFL History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Arizona Cardinals rookie wide receiver David  
Boston saw his first NFL action Saturday night. Having his father 
just a few feet away made it even more special. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Boston, the line judge in the Cardinals-Broncos game,  
became the first father in NFL history to officiate one of his 
son's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Seeman, the league's senior director of officiating, said  
the league supported the pairing during the preseason because 
``it's something that's never occurred,'' but said it won't occur 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a special feeling,'' said David Boston, the Cardinals'  
first-round draft pick from Ohio State. ``I was excited there was a 
member of my family out there. I saw him officiating like he always 
does. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to concentrate on doing my thing. I can't be out there  
watching him, the game goes too fast. I thought I was going to be a 
lot more nervous than I was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, who started the game, finished with two catches for 16  
yards in the Cardinals' 38-7 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The father and son talked before the game, but not during it.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much going on during the game,'' the elder Boston  
said. ``It is difficult and would be a distraction for me and would 
be a distraction for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He caught his first pass right in front of me, and that was  
exciting. He didn't throw the ball back to me (as he was supposed 
to). He caught his second pass in front of me, too, and that time 
he did throw it to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very exciting time for my family and for me to get  
the chance to officiate the first game my son plays in the NFL. I 
wouldn't want to do it every week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Boston vowed to closely follow his son's pro career.  
</P>
<P>
	``I set up my DirecTV and tape all the games,'' he said. ``I  
have two receivers, and I will tape his and my game. I will watch 
my game as an official. I will watch his game as a father.''

<HEADLINE> BNP Can't Get Societe Generale Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French banking group Banque Nationale de Paris won  
control of the Paribas bank but failed to get a majority stake in 
Societe Generale, foiling its attempt to create the world's largest 
bank, financial officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The official announcement was not expected until Tuesday, but a  
series of leaks in the French media appear to have prompted the 
Council of Financial Markets to advance the release of the figures 
on one of France's biggest holiday weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP's failure to get more than 50 percent of Societe Generale  
means that for the time being its attempt to create the world's 
first $1 trillion bank in terms of assets has failed. 
</P>
<P>
	However, to prevent Societe Generale from falling into the hands  
of foreigners, French authorities may act to allow the three-way 
merger to take place. 
</P>
<P>
	Provisional figures released by the Council indicated that BNP  
won 65.1 percent of the capital of Paribas and 36.8 percent of 
Societe Generale, which now finds itself isolated at the end of the 
five-month battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Council also said that BNP would have 31.5 percent of voting  
rights in Societe Generale and a comfortable 65.2 percent in 
Paribas, an investment bank. 
</P>
<P>
	As news of the unofficial results filtered out Friday, both  
Societe Generale and Paribas stock closed up, with only BNP down 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking war, which will contribute to the consolidation of  
the stodgy French banking sector, began in March when BNP made a 
surprise $37 billion dollar offer to trump a friendly merger 
announced several weeks earlier by Societe Generale and Paribas.

<HEADLINE> Christy Mathewson Memorabilia Stolen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA PLUME, Pa. (AP) -- A jersey worn by Christy Mathewson  
commemorating the 1905 World Series champions was among a number of 
items stolen from an exhibit at Keystone College over the weekend, 
marring annual festivities in honor of the former New York Giants 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The items were taken from a locked display of Mathewson  
memorabilia that included baseball and military clothing, pictures 
and books by and about him. The display in the lobby of the 
school's gymnasium was broken into between 10:45 p.m. Friday and 
6:15 a.m. Saturday, according to state police at Dunmore barracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The jersey, which Mathewson wore in 1906 after the Giants had  
won the World Series the previous year, bears the words ``World's 
Champions'' sewn across the chest. Mathewson had cut the right 
sleeve off at the elbow so it wouldn't interfere with his pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	Also taken were Mathewson's contract with the New York Giants --  
bearing his signature and dating to the early 1900s -- and his 
player-manager contract with the Cincinnati Reds from the 1917 and 
1918 seasons, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The theft marred annual festivities in honor of the pitcher, and  
Keystone College President Edward Boehm called the loss 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The memorabilia was left to us by Christy's widow, Jane,''  
Boehm told the Scranton Times. ``It's a collection we've held in 
trust for the family for more than 30 years. We bring it out of the 
vault just once a year for Christy Mathewson Days so the community 
can enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson attended Keystone from 1895 to 1898, earning an  
associate's degree. He also went to Bucknell University until 
launching his major league baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside of the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown,  
N.Y., Keystone holds the largest collection of Mathewson 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Wiles, a research librarian at the Hall of Fame, examined  
the collection three years ago and called it ``the largest and best 
single collection of Mathewson's stuff,'' and said it was far 
superior to the Mathewson collection at the Hall of Fame, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial value of the stolen items could not immediately be  
determined. Hall of Fame representatives said the organization's 
policy bars giving appraisals of such items. 
</P>
<P>
	Campus security officials patrolling the grounds overnight were  
told to put special emphasis on watching the gym but noticed 
nothing unusual, Boehm said. Investigators are looking at the 
possibility that the thief hid in the building when it was being 
closed Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson, a native of Factoryville, was among the first five  
players inducted into the Hall of Fame. He was selected in 1936, 11 
years after he died of tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson pitched for the Giants from 1900 to 1916, then joined  
the Reds for two years. He finished with a 373-188 record and 2.13 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Roadside markers around Keystone's campus honor his memory, as  
does the athletic field which is named for him. Four years ago, the 
college initiated the annual Christy Mathewson Days, scheduled on 
the weekend closest to his birthday, Aug. 12.

<HEADLINE> 'Gravity Assist' Helps Cassini Fly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Cassini spacecraft's swingby of  
Earth on its way to Saturn isn't as complicated or unusual as it 
sounds, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has been using planetary ``gravity assists'' since 1973 to  
fling probes around the outer solar system. The Galileo, Ulysses, 
Pioneer and Voyager missions all successfully employed swingbys to 
get to their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's purely gravity and no more sophisticated than the moon  
moving around the Earth,'' said Cassini program manager Bob 
Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	Exploiting the laws of gravity, Cassini's trajectory near Earth  
will cause it to absorb some of the Earth's momentum, pushing its 
speed up to 11,000 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassini will pass well outside the drag of the atmosphere and  
more than three times higher than the Hubble Space Telescope's 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	A NASA planetary swingby has never missed its target beyond an  
acceptable range, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassini's first flyby of Venus was accurate to less than a mile;  
the second was within 2 1/2 miles of the target. After Earth, the 
spacecraft will do a flyby of Jupiter in December 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined gravity assists with Venus, Earth and Jupiter will  
provide the energy equivalent of 75 tons of rocket fuel. Cassini 
left Earth riding on 3 tons of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galileo spacecraft flew by Earth twice on its way to  
Jupiter. In 1990, it flew within 592 miles of the surface and was 
within five miles of accuracy. In 1992, it flew as close as 189 
miles and came within a half mile of the point.

<HEADLINE> 3 Journalists Sentenced in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Three journalists were sentenced to two  
years in prison Saturday for libeling Egypt's deputy prime 
minister, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A criminal court convicted the three of libeling Deputy Prime  
Minister Youssef Waly in a series of articles and cartoons, 
published over nearly a year, that accused him of trying to ruin 
Egypt's economy. The series was published in the opposition 
Al-Shaab newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Waly, who is also the agricultural minister, has signed several  
agreements with Israel for the supply of seed, fertilizers and 
technology to fight desertification. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Shaab is published by the Labor Party, which is allied to the  
Muslim Brotherhood -- Egypt's strongest Islamic movement -- and 
opposes peace with Israel. The newspaper called Waly a ``traitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three sentenced to two years in prison included the  
newspaper's editor in chief, Magdi Hussein, reporter Salah Bdeiwi 
and cartoonist Essam Hanafi, court officials said on customary 
condition of anonymity. The three also were fined $5,900 each, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth journalist of Al-Shaab, Adel Hussein, a columnist and  
the editor's brother, was fined the equivalent of $5,900 for 
defaming the deputy prime minister to a lesser degree. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first three defendants, the judge handed down the  
maximum sentence allowed under a 1996 press law, which journalists 
and human rights groups have criticized as an infringement on 
freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
	The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights criticized the  
verdict as a ``suppressive method'' that would close ``the outlets 
for the expression of opinion in issues that concern society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, the group urged  
authorities to limit punishment of journalists to fines rather than 
prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The conviction was Magdi Hussein's second. Last year, he and  
another Al-Shaab journalist were sentenced to two years in prison 
for libeling a former interior minister. The Supreme Court freed 
them after they reached a settlement with the minister.

<HEADLINE> Five Women Sue FedEx for Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Five women have filed a $17 million  
sexual harassment suit against Federal Express Corp. and a manager 
at a local office. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit filed Friday in Montgomery County Circuit Court alleges  
that Ronald Epps, 41, sexually assaulted or molested three of the 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth woman accused Epps of threatening her after she  
rejected his advances, while a fifth woman clamied supervisors did 
not follow up on complaints that she had been sexually assaulted 
and harassed by co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far our investigation has revealed that local management  
was aware of what was going on,'' Lawrence S. Lapidus, an attorney 
for the women, said Saturday. ``They allowed this type of 
environment to flourish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Epps has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Carla Boyd, a spokeswoman for the Memphis-based company, said  
officials would not comment on the lawsuit because they had not 
seen it.

<HEADLINE> United 2, Crew 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jaime Moreno's penalty kick goal in the 58th  
minute broke a tie and D.C. United beat Columbus 2-1 Saturday for 
their third straight victory, completing a four-game season sweep 
of the Crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eastern Conference-leading United (16-7), who have won four  
of five, continued their domination of second-place Columbus at RFK 
Stadium and increased their lead over the Crew to eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno's opportunity came after a debatable call by referee  
Brian Hall, who ruled that Crew midfielder Jason Farrell roughly 
upended Marco Etcheverry in the penalty area. Replays indicated 
that Farrell never made contact, with Etcheverry either slipping on 
wet turf or stumbling over a waterlogged ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus (14-8) fell to 0-8 in regular-season play in  
Washington. The Crew's winning streak was halted at three games and 
Columbus was denied a chance to tie its franchise record of 15 
victories in a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly acquired John Maessner also scored for D.C., while Jeff  
Cunningham scored for Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	The final 25 minutes of the first half were played in a  
torrential downpour, forcing players to slosh through a 
water-drenched field. 
</P>
<P>
	United withstood the deluge, outshot Columbus 8-5 and took a 1-0  
lead on Maessner's first goal since his last stint with D.C. a 
year-and-a-half ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Olsen's shot from just beyond the top of the penalty area  
knuckled off Maessner, a ninth-minute substitution for the injured 
Diego Sonora, and into the net vacated by goalie Mark Dougherty, 
who had moved up and to the left to defend Olson's shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely two minutes into a sunny second half, the Crew made it  
1-1 when Cunningham worked a pretty give-and-go with Brian McBride 
at the top of the box, converting a right-footed shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno's seventh goal came about 11 minutes later when he  
skipped a low shot past Dougherty on the penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbus' best chance to tie the score came with 11 minutes left  
in regulation, when D.C.'s Mark Simpson, who had replaced injured 
goalie Tom Presthus in the 35th minute, made consecutive stops on 
Brian Maissoneuve. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew's Stern John sailed a shot wide right three minutes  
later, and with six minutes left, his apparent goal on a header was 
erased by a foul in the box. His backheel chance in traffic with a 
minute remaining was cleared.

<HEADLINE> Weather the Winner at Watkins Glen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *With AP Photo    	
</P>
<P>
	WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) -- Foul weather was the winner for the  
last two days at Watkins Glen International, with business on the 
midway finishing a close second. 
</P>
<P>
	``You from the IRS?'' asked Steve Williams, who was strapping  
them in at the rock climb attraction. ``You're not? OK, then, we're 
having a pretty good day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Coby Cressinger couldn't say that of his sunglasses  
concession. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can count on one hand how many we've sold,'' he said,  
glancing skyward. ``But we're here in case the sun comes out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	Fans milled about the souvenir trailers, sometimes six deep, or  
lined the fence adjacent to the garage hoping to catch a glimpse of 
Dale Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Others queued up outside the portable potties as sanitation  
workers hustled to keep the beer cans from overflowing the refuse 
barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where else can you feel like a pig in all this mud and still  
be having so much fun,'' said Roy Peterson, who described himself 
as ``an improper Bostonian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second-round qualifying for the Winston Cup cars was canceled  
after torrential rain Saturday morning, forcing NASCAR to set the 
field on the basis of time tests Friday. That opening-round session 
was itself delayed 3 1/2 hours by rain. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain stopped early Saturday afternoon, and NASCAR was set  
for the delayed start of a Busch North Series race, one of two 
support events to Sunday's Frontier at the Glen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were telling them 60 seconds to go,'' said Kevin Triplett,  
NASCAR's director of operations. ``Then we looked up and we 
couldn't see the guy we were talking to on the radio.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A heavy, misty fog had suddenly a rolled in. Soon, visibility  
was less than 100 feet throughout the facility just south of Seneca 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Busch race began four hours late. But ``Happy Hour,'' the  
celebrated final practice where Winston Cup car crews make final, 
crucial judgments about their racing setups, was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't help Kenny Wallace prepare, but gave him  
considerable time to brush up on his racing delays monologue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure by the time today is over, we'll know who's in the 28  
car,'' he said, alluding to the lengthy process it took for Robert 
Yates to fill the seat of the fired Kenny Irwin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said NASCAR is of little help in rain delays -- even  
those that create a 12-hour day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go up to them and ask them what's going to happen, and  
they never tell you,'' he said. ``The only person who knows is 
Earnhardt, and he leaves.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyers: Ala. Suspect Unstable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIANA, Ala. (AP) -- A man accused of fatally shooting three  
people at two offices he worked at is ``at best, very slow'' and 
should be in a mental health facility instead of Alabama's electric 
chair, defense attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Shelby County grand jury on Friday indicted Alan Eugene  
Miller, 34, on one count of capital murder. Miller is accused of 
opening fire at Ferguson Enterprises and Post Airgas in Pelham on 
Aug. 5, killing Lee Holdbrooks, 32; Christopher Scott Yancy, 28; 
and Terry Jarvis, 39. 
</P>
<P>
	A capital murder conviction carries a penalty of either life in  
prison without possibility of parole or the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby County District Attorney Robby Owens said he would  
``absolutely'' seek the death penalty. He said Miller was indicted 
on one count because the three were slain in a single course of 
action. Arraignment is set for Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdbrooks and Yancy were Ferguson employees, and Jarvis was a  
supervisor at Post Airgas. Miller was a Ferguson truck driver at 
the time of the incident, and was laid off from Post Airgas in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	A friend of Holdbrooks has said Miller was angry because he felt  
Holdbrooks, another driver, was receiving longer and better routes 
than he was. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's attorney, Rodger Bass, said the defense will claim  
Miller was mentally unstable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the jury agrees he is insane, he wouldn't just be turned  
loose. He would be committed to a secure mental facility,'' said 
Bass, who described his client as ``at best, very slow.''

<HEADLINE> New Computer Is Size of an Aspirin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The latest from the cyberworld: an  
aspirin-size computer that, embedded in household appliances, could 
let people on the road or at the office use the Internet to cool 
their homes, heat coffee and tape TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Believed to be the smallest such computer ever built, the  
inexpensive device could help usher in a new generation of 
connected home appliances, from VCRs to coffee makers to small 
cameras, controlled over the Internet from almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implications of this are more than a silly little  
competition among a bunch of researchers,'' said H. Shrikumar, who 
studies specialized machine automation at the University of 
Massachusetts in Amherst. ``This has tremendous application in the 
way it might change our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project also testifies to how much utility a concise  
programmer can pack into a limited amount of computer memory, even 
in these days of multimegabyte software applications with millions 
of lines of code. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny computer, slightly larger than the head of a match, is  
connected to the Internet from Shrikumar's apartment near the 
university. It includes a tiny 4-megahertz processor he bought for 
49 cents and a small 32-kilobyte memory chip that stores World Wide 
Web pages and other data. 
</P>
<P>
	Although those numbers are paltry compared to the speed and  
storage of modern personal computers, which run thousands of times 
faster and contain hundreds of times more storage, the tiny 
computer still is more powerful than typical computers less than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrikumar, 33, said his computer can be built for less than $1,  
making it practical to install the devices in a variety of home 
electronics and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Some existing appliances, such as modern thermostats or newer  
coffee makers, can be programmed individually. But appliances 
connected using the language of the Internet, called ``TCP/IP,'' 
could communicate with each other even if made by different 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the hour the homeowner sets for his alarm clock, for  
example, the thermostat could automatically turn up the heat, the 
television could turn on the morning news and the coffee could 
begin brewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one click, the whole house now wakes up with you,'' he  
said. ``This can make our way of life much easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, with the appliances connected to a home network that  
also maintained a continuous connection with the Internet, 
consumers could use the Web browser on an office computer to 
program their VCRs, turn on their porch lights, even activate 
cameras to check on the baby sitter. 
</P>
<P>
	The new wave of high-speed Internet connections using cable TV  
modems or new digital phone lines already offer such continuous 
hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I want a computer in my refrigerator that's  
controllable, but the heating system, that's a legitimate one 
you'll want to control,'' said Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap 
Software Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., who built the first small 
Internet computer more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could solve the problem of programming the VCR. You could  
have more sophisticated control mechanisms, have different time 
schedules on the weekdays,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrikumar's Internet computer is smaller than one built earlier  
this year at Stanford University, which includes a much more 
powerful processor and lots more memory. But the Stanford computer 
costs more than $800. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughan Pratt, the Stanford professor in charge of that project,  
said the implications of Shrikumar's work are enormous. 
``Everything that shrinks down to a size that can be embedded in 
small spaces will have a big impact,'' Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Shrikumar began testing his computer this summer, and  
after he announced it on a private Internet discussion group, about 
5,000 people daily from around 70 countries have visited the tiny 
computer's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was just a fun hobby project,'' said Shrikumar, who  
expects to graduate next year. ``It caught my attention and 
demanded that it be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is not sure what he will do once he leaves school.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of things one can do,'' he said. ``It's a big  
world.''

<HEADLINE> Florida State in Familiar Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- As always, perfection is the goal at  
Florida State in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be a shocking disappointment if we don't win the  
national title,'' tight end Ryan Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fifth time since 1988, the Seminoles find themselves No.  
1 in The Associated Press preseason college football poll. Florida 
State won the national title in 1993, one the years it started the 
season No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're used to having that ol' bull's-eye on our backs,'' coach  
Bobby Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	With a healthy Chris Weinke back at quarterback, Heisman  
Trophy-seeking Peter Warrick returning and seven starters from the 
nation's top defense ready to go, it's easy to see why so much is 
expected from the Seminoles. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Florida State, playing without the injured Weinke,  
came up just short of a national title, losing to Tennessee in the 
Fiesta Bowl. As Bowden enters his 24th year as Florida State's 
coach, he's still looking for that elusive perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time a year ago, I said we had a talented football team,  
but it's the least experience we've had in a long time,'' Bowden 
said. ``Now we've got most of the same guys back. Most of those 
guys started. That's the reason for so much preseason optimism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles finished 11-2 last year, extending their NCAA  
record to 12 straight seasons with at least 10 victories and ranked 
among the nation's top four teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden has three returning All-Americans among his 16 starters.  
There are also 19 fifth-year seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	``My only concern is the kids coming back with an attitude  
they're willing to do what it takes,'' Bowden said. ``Complacency, 
that could hurt you and then of course injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weinke, who threw for 2,487 yards and 19 TDs, had surgery on his  
spine after he injured his neck against Virginia late last season. 
He will avoid contact on the field until the Seminoles open the 
season against Louisiana Tech on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, former quarterback Dan Kendra is seeking to come back from  
a knee injury at a new position, fullback. 
</P>
<P>
	With Weinke out late last year, Marcus Outzen led the Seminoles  
to a pair of November victories, including one over Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick caught 61 passes for 1,232 yards and 11 TDs, and kicker  
Sebastian Janikowski had 27 field goals. And then there's Travis 
Minor, who ran for 857 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense, anchored by All-American tackle Corey Simon and  
Jerry Johnson, allowed 11.5 points and 214.5 yards a game in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Roland Seymour and Jamal Reynolds are the likely starters at  
end, with Brian Allen, Tommy Polley and Bradley Jennings at the 
linebacker spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Edwards, Tay Cody and Reggie Durden give the Seminoles a  
talented group of corners to go along with hard-hitting safeties 
Chris Hope and Derrick Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the Seminoles should win the ACC title, with the  
toughest competition coming from Georgia Tech. The night game is 
Sept. 11 in Tallahassee. The other toughies are nonconference games 
against Miami on Oct. 9 and at Florida on Nov. 20.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Looks To Repeat As Champs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tee Martin hadn't even made it home from  
the Fiesta Bowl last January when he was asked The Question: Can 
the Volunteers repeat as national champions? 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Man, just let me enjoy this one first,''' the  
quarterback said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Phillip Fulmer barely had his headset off after Tennessee  
won the title when he was asked the same question. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to know if we're going to do it again,'' he  
said. ``It was almost like I didn't have time to enjoy winning a 
national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yep, time's up.  
</P>
<P>
	With the new season upon them, the Vols face the pressure of  
trying to defend the crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard last year and it'll be even harder this year,''  
said Martin, entering his senior season. ``They'll know what to 
prepare for. They'll have a whole year of film on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee's quest for a repeat begins when Wyoming comes to  
Knoxville on Sept. 4. Two weeks later they travel to Gainesville -- 
where they last won in 1971 -- for the annual showdown with Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	To defend their two consecutive Southeastern Conference titles  
the Vols must get by the Gators and up-and-coming Georgia in the 
SEC Eastern Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee, ranked No. 2 in The Associated Press preseason poll,  
also has to go to Alabama and Arkansas, and will be home against 
Auburn, Georgia and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awful hard to go undefeated if you play a reasonable  
schedule,'' said Fulmer, whose team was 13-0 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The most glaring graduation losses from last year's team are  
big-play receiver Peerless Price; middle linebacker Al Wilson, the 
heart and soul of the defense; and reliable placekicker Jeff Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	But if games are won and lost in the trenches, as most coaches  
insist they are, the Vols start the season in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this could be the best offensive line I've seen at  
Tennessee, and without question it should be the best defensive 
line,'' said Fulmer, an offensive lineman in his playing days and 
former offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
	On offense, guard Cosey Coleman, tackle Chad Clifton and center  
Spencer Riley are returning starters. Coleman, a 6-foot-5, 
315-pound junior and third-year starter, is widely considered one 
of the best Tennessee has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Tucker played a lot last year and is penciled in at the  
tackle opposite Clifton. Toby Champion and converted defensive 
lineman Fred Weary are expected to battle it out for the other 
guard spot. 
</P>
<P>
	On defense the Vols return starters Shaun Ellis at end and  
tackles Billy Ratliff and Darwin Walker. Will Overstreet 
contributed at the other end last year and also is back. 
</P>
<P>
	A player everyone is watching is big (6-7, 280 pounds) tackle  
John Henderson, who couldn't play last year as a partial academic 
qualifier but made his presence felt in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer has always stressed speed, and the Vols have plenty of  
it, plus experience, at the skill positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin matured tremendously in his first season as a starter. He  
was brought along slowly but still put up respectable numbers: 153 
completions in 267 attempts (57 percent) for 2,164 yards, with 19 
touchdowns and six interceptions, including an NCAA-record 
23-for-24 performance against South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he realizes there's a long season ahead and the  
success of last year will only make the Vols everybody's No. 1 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't be satisfied with what we won last year. We  
understand what it took to win 13 games and we're ready to do it 
again,'' he said. ``It's time to show what we can do, not talk 
about what we did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamal Lewis, who had the sixth-highest freshman rushing total in  
NCAA history two seasons ago (1,367 yards), returns at tailback 
after missing all but four games last year with a knee injury. He 
was averaging 124 yards a game until he got hurt against Auburn on 
Oct. 3, and by all accounts his rehabilitation has gone well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' Lewis said. ``My speed is great, my agility is  
there. I'm ready to go win some football games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' replacements developed into reliable players. Travis  
Henry finished the season with 970 yards rushing and Travis 
Stephens added 477. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillip Crosby and Will Bartholomew are both good blockers at  
fullback, although neither has anywhere near the speed of the 
departed Shawn Bryson. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Price is a major concern. His big-play ability was  
critical to the Vols' success in '98, as demonstrated by his MVP 
performance in the 23-16 Fiesta Bowl victory over Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	The only returning receiver with significant experience is  
Cedrick Wilson, who is neither as big (5-10, 175) nor as fast as 
Price. But he is tough and averaged 17 yards on 33 catches last 
year, nearly 2 yards a catch better than Price. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Erik Parker has shown promise when he's been healthy.  
Freshman Leonard Scott is one of the fastest players in the country 
-- he's the NCAA 60-meter track champion -- and junior David Martin 
has the size (6-4, 210) to make himself an inviting target. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing Wilson's vocal leadership at middle linebacker is as  
much a priority as replacing his talent. Dominique Stevenson and 
Bernard Jackson are good athletes, but neither has significant 
experience in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	At outside linebacker, Raynoch Thompson is one of the best in  
the country and Eric Westmoreland is solid, especially in pass 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The defensive backfield returns three starters: Dwayne Goodrich  
at cornerback and safeties Deon Grant and Fred White. Junior Andre 
Lott will be at the other corner. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leverton returns as the punter.  
</P>
<P>
	Finding a reliable replacement for Hall is key. His clutch late  
field goals beat Syracuse and Florida to get the Vols off to a 2-0 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior walk-on Robert Loudermilk is the presumptive starter, but  
freshman Stephen Lee could work his way into the job if he's as 
good as advertised. 
</P>
<P>
	Fulmer, who was rewarded with a six-year, $6 million contract  
before the Fiesta Bowl, realizes talent alone won't win another 
national title. It takes a lot of work and a little luck, which the 
Vols got their share of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he's happy to be where he is.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like the expectations and I like to rise to those  
expectations,'' Fulmer said.

<HEADLINE> PGA Championship Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINAH, Ill. (AP) -- Nick Price's sore wrist got a jolt this  
week -- from a trainer. Whatever he did seemed to work. Price, a 
two-time winner of the PGA Championship, shot a 3-under 69 Saturday 
and is only five shots behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish it would hurt more often -- I'd drive the ball better,''  
Price said. ``It's getting better and better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think on Tuesday when I went into the fitness trailer, the  
one fellow in there felt that one of the bones in the top of my 
wrist was out of place. And he gave it a little snap and it felt 
like it went back into place. And it's just gotten stronger and 
stronger as the week has progressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The right wrist, bothering Price since the British Open, is  
still a bit tender. But Price has no complaints, especially after 
the way he hit the ball off the tee Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm driving the ball well again, which has been absent from my  
game for the last 2 1/2 months, and I think that's the reason I'm 
playing well because I seem to be hitting a lot of fairways,'' 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WHERE'D IT GO?:* Mark Brooks, the 1996 PGA champ, made a  
hole-in-one Saturday on the 206-yard 17th hole. Brooks used a 
3-iron for his ace, the 29th hole-in-one since 1970 in the PGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit it a little fat, pushed it and the wind brought it  
back,'' Brooks said. ``It didn't carry on the green, it hit the 
collar. I was actually surprised it carried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks' ace helped him shoot a 2-under 70 to move to 3-under 213  
for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice playing OK and then having some luck,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TOUGH TO REPEAT:* Defending champion Vijay Singh shot a 77  
Saturday and fell 16 shots back at 5 over, showing how difficult it 
has been to repeat in the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1990s, the best finish by a PGA champion in the next  
year's tournament was a third-place tie by Steve Elkington in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ONE MOMENT IN TIME:* John Daly's victory in 1991 after he made  
the tournament as an alternate has been selected as the top moment 
in PGA Championship history. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's win at Crooked Stick in Carmel, Ind., was picked by 921  
respondents from the general public, who cast their ballots on the 
PGA web site. There were 3,140 public voters overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's accomplishment also was chosen as the PGA Championship's  
top moment by an international panel of 41 writers and 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The ninth alternate prior to the 1991 tournament, Daly received  
a call less than 24 hours before it began, telling him he had moved 
up to No. 1 alternate. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly then drove through the night to reach the course, where he  
learned he was replacing Nick Price, who had withdrawn to attend 
the birth of his son. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-hitting Daly didn't even have time to practice. And he  
didn't need it. He shot a 12-under 276 to win by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OLD FELLAS:* Saturday was not a good day for the veterans in  
the field. Hale Irwin, at 54, shot a 78. Jay Haas, 45, the leader 
after two rounds, had a 75, and 49-year-old Lanny Wadkins shot a 
74. 
</P>
<P>
	Haas is still in contention at 6 under through three rounds,  
five shots behind Tiger Woods and Mike Weir. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO BOGEYS:* Sergio Garcia recorded his second bogey-free round.  
He has made only two bogeys the entire tournament, those coming 
during Friday's second round. That's why the 19-year-old is only 
two shots off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ADMITTED HACKER:* Chicago Bulls coach Tim Floyd was a spectator  
for Saturday's third round. He quickly pointed out that he's no 
golfer. Not a serious one, at least. 
</P>
<P>
	``I play about six times a year in charity events and it's  
brutal,'' Floyd said. ``I watch it on TV. I don't play a lot and 
I've never watched an event, so I don't know if that qualifies me 
as a fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd said the Bulls' surprising trade this week, one that sent  
Brent Barry to Seattle for Hersey Hawkins and James Cotton, was 
predicated greatly on salary cap considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That had a lot to do with it. It was more cap than anything to  
do with Brent,'' Floyd said. Barry had signed a six-year, $27 
million deal with the Bulls last January.

<HEADLINE> GOP Congressman Touts Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans can find retirement security for  
themselves and their children in the GOP tax bill that emphasizes 
personal savings, a Republican congressman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year, $792 billion tax-cut package passed this month  
``will result in more pension coverage, better-funded pensions and 
more retirement security for millions of workers,'' Rep. Rob 
Portman of Ohio said in the GOP's weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has threatened to veto the bill because he  
contends it is so large it would bring back government deficits and 
its tax breaks would mainly benefit wealthier Americans. Instead, 
he has proposed using some of the surplus for Medicare and some for 
new government-subsidized retirement accounts for low- and 
middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	But Portman, a member of the House's tax-writing Ways and Means  
Committee and co-chairman of the House Republicans' Retirement 
Security Task Force, insisted the legislation would ``give millions 
of American workers the real peace of mind that comes with having 
your own personal retirement savings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the package would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow more tax-sheltered deposits into IRA, 401(k) and other  
pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Make pensions portable, and let workers become vested in  
retirement plans in three years instead of five. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let people 50 or older make extra, ``catch-up'' contributions  
to pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you, and every working American, to be able to keep  
more of the money you earn so you can prepare a more secure future 
for yourself and your children,'' Portman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would be willing to negotiate tax cuts only  
after his other budget priorities have been addressed, beginning 
with Medicare's long-term solvency. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill includes a one-percentage-point reduction in all  
income-tax rates, an easing of the tax paid by many married 
couples, a cut in the capital gains tax on profits from 
investments, elimination of the inheritance tax on large estates 
and various tax breaks for businesses.

<HEADLINE> Driftwood Cross Marks JFK Jr. Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- On a beach near this Martha's Vineyard  
town stands a lone reminder of the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr., 
his wife and her sister -- a simple cross fashioned from pieces of 
driftwood lashed together with grape vines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to come and see it,'' said Stephanie O'Leary, 37, of  
Hanson, one of about a dozen people visiting the cross on a recent 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting chills,'' said 33-year-old Kim Noonan of  
Marshfield, staring at the 4-foot cross. ``It's still hard to 
believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a month after their deaths, the simple monument is about  
the only place to mourn. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's parents are buried at Arlington National Cemetery,  
which draws nearly 4.5 million visitors each year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 38-year-old Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and  
Lauren Bessette, 34, were buried at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-engine Piper Saratoga piloted by Kennedy plummeted  
into the ocean about 7 miles from Martha's Vineyard on the night of 
July 16, instantly killing all three. 
</P>
<P>
	They had taken off from Fairfield, N.J., en route to the  
Vineyard, where they were to drop off Lauren Bessette, and then to 
Hyannis Port for the wedding of Rory Kennedy, daughter of the late 
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The cross was erected by several summer and year-round residents  
on July 21, the day the bodies and the fuselage of their small 
plane were located on the ocean bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	It is anchored in the sand of Philbin Beach, where Lauren  
Bessette's luggage had washed up four days earlier, bringing 
unofficial confirmation that the three were dead. And it's not far 
from the estate that Kennedy and his sister, Caroline, inherited 
from their mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	It leans slightly to the left and is crowned by two small  
American flags. The names John, Carolyn and Lauren are written in 
blue marker on the arms of the cross, which is encircled by rocks, 
many bearing personal messages. ``TOO SOON'' is scratched onto one 
stone. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the burial at sea, many tourists on Cape Cod and  
the Vineyard had yearned for some kind of permanent memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	But others, such as John Carroll of Burrillville, R.I., who was  
on the Cape at the time of the private ceremony, said a permanent 
resting spot probably would have caused mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been to Jim Morrison's grave in Paris. It's a circus,''  
he said of the leader of the band The Doors. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Chilmark, the next community south of here, the grave of  
comedian John Belushi still gets regular visits, 17 years after he 
died of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vineyard also gets plenty of attention for other reasons,  
including a 10-day visit beginning Thursday by President Clinton 
and likely New York senatorial candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The cross is mostly of interest to visitors.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was like he was a part of our family, a hope for the  
future,'' said Walter Musto, a 52-year-old personnel director for 
the Rhode Island National Guard. ``You always wanted the best for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the locals, on the other hand, hadn't seen the humble  
memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Discretion is as important to residents as it was to the  
famously publicity shy Mrs. Onassis, said Berta Welch, 39, a crafts 
store owner in Wampanoag. 
</P>
<P>
	``People really felt the Kennedys wanted their privacy,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driftwood cross is a fragile thing that could be swept into  
the ocean by a storm.

	``If it's doomed to be taken by the sea, that's its destiny,''  
said Gregory Sheaffer, a 29-year-old summer resident who says he 
helped erect the cross.

<HEADLINE> Report: Officer Lax With LA Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Months before a white supremacist was accused  
of firing on a Jewish center and killing a postal worker here, he 
was ordered by a judge in Washington to give up his guns. 
</P>
<P>
	But according to a report in today's Los Angeles Times, Buford  
O. Furrow Jr.'s probation officer never checked to see if he 
complied with the judge's order, and did not make recommended 
visits to his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington state corrections officials say they'll review the  
handling of the probation of Furrow, who this week was charged with 
murder and attempted murder for the attacks that apparently were 
fueled by hate. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow met five times with the probation officer, Patrick  
Gosney, but there were no visits to his home even though a 
Washington state Department of Corrections memo suggests such 
visits, said corrections spokesman Veltry Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an option of the department, not a mandate,'' said  
Johnson, who conceded ``one could certainly draw the inference'' 
that more could have been done to monitor Furrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow, 37, is accused of opening fire at the North Valley  
Jewish Community Center, wounding five people, on Tuesday. Later, 
police say, he fatally shot mail carrier Joseph Ileto before 
hailing a cab to Las Vegas, where he surrendered the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ileto was targeted because he was a federal employee and of  
Filipino descent, authorities said. Funeral services were scheduled 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one of the five community center shooting victims remains  
hospitalized. Five-year-old Benjamin Kadish was in critical 
condition at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. Doctors planned to 
wean him off a respirator, said hospital spokesman Steve Rutledge. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Stepakoff, 6, was released from the hospital Friday  
afternoon, sporting floral print shorts, a black Los Angeles Police 
Department baseball cap and a knee-high cast on his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``My family and I want to express our sincere appreciation for  
the outpouring of support we have received from around the 
country,'' said his father, Alan Stepakoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua is not ready to talk about what happened and the family  
also is having difficulty dealing with it, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot understand someone who has that kind of hate,''  
Stepakoff said. ``There's no way we can lock ourselves up and live 
in fear of these kinds of instances. We can't allow those kind of 
people to ruin our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Josh and his brother are expected to return to the center.  
</P>
<P>
	Furrow has been charged with murder by both Los Angeles County  
and federal prosecutors for the death of Ileto. The county also 
charged him with five counts of attempted murder in the attack at 
the center. Either murder charge could lead to a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow was barred from owning guns in Washington because of his  
criminal record, which included a second-degree assault charge for 
attacking a nurse at a psychiatric hospital after changing his mind 
about admitting himself. 
</P>
<P>
	But even though he was prohibited from having the guns, he was  
known for having them readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Furrow sold guns to The Loaner Too pawn shop in  
Everett, Wash., but usually bought them back, store manager David 
McGee told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know Buford,'' McGee said. ``Quiet guy, beady eyes. ... The  
guy has a cache like you wouldn't believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow is accused of using an Uzi assault-style submachine gun  
to fire at the Jewish center and a 9 mm Glock to kill Ileto. The 
Glock and other weapons were recovered from a vehicle Furrow 
allegedly carjacked after the shootings. Officers found ammunition, 
bulletproof vests and devices that may have been smoke grenades in 
a van believed to have been abandoned by Furrow, who has ties to 
neo-Nazi groups in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Tight security apparently dissuaded Furrow from firing on three  
well-known Jewish sites. The three locations were circled on a map 
that authorities found after the shooting, Rabbi Marvin Hier, 
founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Wiesenthal center, a second target was the  
University of Judaism, Hier said. Law enforcement officials warned 
Hier of the danger but asked him to keep the information 
confidential, Hier said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas declined to comment about any  
such warning. 
</P>
<P>
	The third institution allegedly targeted was the Skirball  
Cultural Center, a museum on Jewish culture, the Los Angeles Times 
reported Friday, citing an unidentified law enforcement source. 
</P>
<P>
	Furrow stumbled upon the North Valley center where the shooting  
occurred when he stopped to get gas, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Daisies and Nites Wins Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Daisies and Nites took the lead on the first turn  
and scored a five-length victory Saturday in the $100,000 Shocker 
T. Handicap for fillies and mares on a sloppy track at Calder Race 
Course Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Holy Capote, the 3-2 favorite, rallied to finish second and  
Extended Applause edged Dancer's Attitude for third in a field of 
eight going 1 1-16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jose Rivera II, Daisies and Nites was timed in 1:45  
2-5 and paid $12, $5 and $3. Holy Capote paid $3.20 and $2.60. 
Extended Applause paid $2.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Extended Applause took the early lead on the inside but Daisies  
and Nites, on the outside, was a length in front into the first 
turn and she proved much the best. She was 1 1/2 lengths in front of 
Extended Applause turning down the backstretch. Dancer's Attutude 
was seventh and Holy Capote last. 
</P>
<P>
	Daisies and Nites still led by 1 1/2 lengths leaving the  
backstretch as Holy Capote rallied into fifth. She increased her 
lead to 2 1/2 lengths turning for home and doubled that margin in the 
final eighth of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Holy Capote was up for second on the outside, a neck in front of  
Extended Applause, who was a nose in front of Dancer's Attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner, a 4-year-old Florida-bred, has won six of 14 starts  
and has been in the money 10 times, with earnings of $150,240. 
</P>
<P>
	In her previous start, Daisies and Nites won by 4 1/2 lengths on a  
sloppy track and was second in the Voodoo Dance Handicap at Calder 
July 18.

<HEADLINE> Man on Ventilator Since 1967 Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A man who remained motionless in a  
hospital bed since 1967, when he was paralyzed in a high school gym 
accident, died when hospital authorities heeded his wish and 
unplugged his ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill White, believed to be one of America's longest surviving  
quadriplegics on a ventilator, died Friday at 7:03 p.m., according 
to Strong Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Teri D'Agostino. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors this week said they would not oppose White's request  
to have the machine unplugged. Under New York law, patients may 
discontinue lifesaving treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	White had asked that details surrounding his death be kept  
private. D'Agostino declined comment on what time the ventilator 
was shut off or who was with him when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a great sadness there. And yet, people feel maybe a  
strange sense of gratification as well, because this is what Bill 
wanted,'' D'Agostino said. 
</P>
<P>
	White, 50, needed 24-hour care and rarely left his hospital bed  
since the accident. His hospital bill, which totaled more than 
$200,000 a year, was paid by Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Motivated by ``concerns about his deteriorating health,'' White  
convinced a team of doctors, psychiatrists, social workers and 
patient advocates that he was mentally competent and not motivated 
by depression. 
</P>
<P>
	After a week-long review, the office of Monroe County District  
Attorney Howard Relin concluded that White had ``the right to 
refuse treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White had asked hospital staff a few months ago to discontinue  
his ventilator treatment. The hospital promised to honor his 
request a week ago but held off when Relin asked to review the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	White was paralyzed from the neck down at age 18 when he bounced  
on a springboard and flew over the parallel bars. A student who was 
supposed to help him land was not ready. White knocked into him, 
veered off the mat and crashed headfirst on the wooden floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew instantly what happened -- I felt all the sensation go  
out of my hands,'' White said in a 1997 interview with the 
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McBride, a friend of 25 years who staunchly opposed  
White's decision, said he was struggling to understand it and the 
hospital's refusal to talk him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why his life should not be worth living I'll never know,''  
McBride told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle on Friday. ``He 
was a great guy. I miss him already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A disabled-rights group and religious activists protested  
outside the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rochester-based Center for Disability Rights requested a  
temporary injunction to block the hospital from assisting in the 
death, but a federal judge denied the request, saying the document 
wasn't properly drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Darling, center's executive director, said news of White's  
death was taking a heavy toll on the center's members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, every one failed this man, including the hospital  
entrusted with his care,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hospital had increased security because people claiming to  
be friends of White made their way to his room to dissuade him.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Hire 2 Assistant Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons have added a lot  
of experience to their coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo McHone, a former coach of the San Antonio Spurs, and Larry  
Drew, an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers the past seven 
seasons, were hired as Pistons assistant coaches Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	McHone, who has been coaching for 30 years, directed the Spurs  
during the 1984-1985 season and was an assistant in San Antonio and 
Cleveland for four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached in the Continental Basketball Association the past  
six seasons, leading the Sioux Falls Skyforce to the finals in four 
of the past five seasons and the title in 1996. He also coached the 
Yakima Sun Kings to the title in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	McHone also helped the USA men's basketball team win a silver  
medal in the Pan American Games this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how to win and his teams have always played an  
up-tempo style,'' Pistons coach Alvin Gentry said. ``With our 
athletes, he can really help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drew, originally drafted by the Pistons in 1980, was an  
assistant for the Lakers under Randy Pfund, Del Harris and Kurt 
Rambis. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can work with the players in a developmental role and make  
us a better team,'' Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew played with the Pistons, Kansas City, Sacramento, the Los  
Angeles Clippers and the Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Cheap Oil Imports Irk US Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Back when Americans were coping with the  
energy crisis, the idea that there could someday be a trade 
complaint against cheap oil imports would have gotten anyone 
laughed out of the line at the gasoline pump. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's just been one, the charge by small U.S. producers  
that four exporting nations dumped cut-rate oil on the market in 
violation of American trade laws, depressing their prices and 
crippling their business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department dismissed their case on Monday. By the  
time it was filed, the market had turned up, after two years of 
plunging prices. 
</P>
<P>
	World prices, which slumped because of slackening demand and  
overflow supplies, have been increasing. The Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on production curbs to push up 
prices. Demand is going up, too, and the Energy Department expects 
higher world oil prices to hold for the rest of this year and all 
of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris-based International Energy Agency says the oil glut of  
1998 is yielding to tightening markets in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, U.S. oil imports are expected to increase.  
Twenty-five years ago, when the Arab oil embargo choked supplies, 
led to those lines at the gasoline pump and sent prices up four 
times over, oil imports accounted for 36 percent of U.S. 
consumption. President Nixon said the United States should produce 
and conserve its way to energy self-sufficiency by 1980. Instead, 
imports went up, past 40 percent when President Carter declared the 
moral equivalent of war against the energy crisis of the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservation efforts begun in that era have made the nation more  
energy efficient. But demand, and diminishing domestic production, 
have made it more reliant on imports. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Congress voted to declare that 50 percent dependence on  
imported oil was the peril point for national security. Four years 
later, imports exceeded half of U.S. use for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimate now is 56 percent, and increasing. According to the  
Energy Department, net imports could account for nearly 70 percent 
of U.S. consumption by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	No crisis, though, so no issue, except for the complaint of the  
small oilmen and their congressional allies, who want legislation 
to help them stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
	There are House and Senate bills to do it with tax breaks and  
other incentives. A $246 million tax break for small producers is 
part of the Republican tax cut, passed by Congress but bound for a 
veto when it gets to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	By Energy Department estimate, U.S. oil consumption is expected  
to increase by nearly 3 percent this year and next. But domestic 
oil production is forecast to decline by 3.7 percent this year and 
an additional 1.1 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent producers who lodged the cheap oil complaint  
argued that Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Iraq had been 
dumping cheap oil in violation of U.S. trade laws, at the expense 
of their business. The group called Save Domestic Oil Inc. sought 
to trigger anti-dumping laws, which could have led to steep tariffs 
on about 60 percent of the oil imported into the United States. It 
was rejected for lack of broad support in the oil industry; and 
while the independent group said it would appeal, that would take 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Petroleum Institute, representing major producers,  
had opposed the trade move by the independents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that low world oil prices have seriously  
harmed U.S. producers, their workers and related industries,'' the 
API said after the case was dismissed. ``Many thousands of people 
have lost their jobs and many firms have been shut down. But these 
low prices were set by the forces of supply and demand in 
international markets, not by alleged unfair pricing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those markets can pump prices up, too.  
</P>
<P>
	That's been the more customary American complaint about foreign  
producers. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Raiders Give Wheatley a 3rd Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Tyrone Wheatley never really fit during  
four unhappy seasons with the New York Giants, and was traded to 
Miami. He never got much of an opportunity with the Dolphins, who 
cut him early in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Wheatley is with the Oakland Raiders, a team that has made a  
tradition of trying to rehabilitate other clubs' castoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The running back may get an opportunity to show why he was the  
17th pick overall in the 1995 draft when the Raiders play host to 
the Dallas Cowboys in an exhibition game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In practices, he has impressed the Raiders with his power.  
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't had a chance to play much the last couple of years.  
We're not going to judge Tyrone Wheatley on his past at all. We're 
going to judge him on what he does here,'' coach Jon Gruden said. 
``He's been a real pleasant surprise for us. We're happy with the 
things he's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley, who also may get to return kickoffs, is vying for one  
of the backup spots behind starter Napoleon Kaufman. Among the 
other contenders is former Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam, 
who is expected to play against Dallas despite a tender hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	The game also will give the Raiders a chance to look at wide  
receiver and kick returner Aaron Bailey, who spent five seasons 
with the Indianapolis Colts and was signed this week by Oakland as 
a free agent because injuries have depleted the team's receiving 
corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, which lost 20-17 in overtime to the Cleveland Browns on  
Monday night, will use the game to get another look at five young 
receivers competing for perhaps two roster spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates are fourth-round pick Wane McGarity, sixth-round  
selection MarTay Jenkins and free agents John Washington, Jason 
Tucker and Deon Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity had a 15-yard reception on Dallas' first scoring drive.  
Jenkins scored on a 35-yard touchdown pass. Washington tied for the 
team high with four catches, and Tucker had one catch for 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity's chances of making the squad may be helped by some  
praise he has received from quarterback Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does some really nice things as far as running routes,''  
Aikman said. ``Even if the ball isn't caught, he's always right 
there in contention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to evaluating young players, Cowboys coach Chan  
Gailey also hopes to play a cleaner game. In the loss to the 
Browns, the Cowboys were penalized 17 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been emphasizing it, we've been talking about it,''  
Gailey said. ``Certain ones you can understand, but you can't come 
up with too many reasons. You start getting reasons and reasons 
turn to excuses. We have committed to eliminate the problem before 
we get too far down the road.''

<HEADLINE> Pfizer Drops New Diabetes Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pfizer Inc. has stopped development of an  
experimental drug to treat nerve damage from diabetes, joining 
other big drug companies that have failed to find a cure for the 
often-debilitating condition. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the 16 million diabetics in the United States  
eventually will suffer from diabetic neuropathy, a complication 
characterized by extreme pain or loss of feeling in the hands and 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer was in late-stage human testing of its drug Alond when  
the company realized it found no improvement in patients taking the 
pill. Pfizer was testing Alond in 421 patients at 23 health centers 
across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer said part of the problem with Alond was in finding a way  
to detect whether nerves damaged by diabetes were growing back. 
Pfizer was taking biopsies of patients' nerves to measure any 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes advocates said Pfizer's announcement, which was made  
late Thursday, was a setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its always disappointing when you hope something is going to  
be a cure'' Marian Parrot, a spokeswoman for the American Diabetes 
Association, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer continues to study Alond to treat kidney and heart  
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 1980s, several big pharmaceutical companies, including  
Merck and American Home Products, have tried to develop a drug to 
treat diabetic neuropathy. The goal has proven elusive. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, doctors can only treat the symptoms of the  
condition with pain medication and antidepressants. And patients 
must learn to cope with the complication that gets progressively 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The best way to reduce symptoms is though tight control of blood  
sugar levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech, a top biotech company, in April stopped development  
of its diabetic neuropathy drug after a study showed the 
experimental pill Neuleze was failing. Until then, Genentech was 
considered furthest along in the race to find an effective 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The only major drugmaker that has publicly disclosed it is still  
testing a drug for diabetic neuropathy is Warner-Lambert. The 
company's Zenarestat is in advanced human testing, though results 
of those studies are not expected for at least a year. Drug 
companies are not obligated to disclose which drugs they are 
researching. 
</P>
<P>
	Most securities analysts have become used to failures in  
diabetic neuropathy research so Pfizer's announcement was not a 
major blow for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Pfizer rose 50 cents to $34.50 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

	AMES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush scored a convincing victory in  
an Iowa straw poll Saturday, passing an early test of political 
potency that could unravel other Republican presidential campaigns. 
Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole finished second and third. Weak 
showings by former Vice President Dan Quayle and Lamar Alexander

express outrage at the chronic political violence that apparently 
took the life of the country's most beloved satirist. Garzon, 38, 
was shot as he drove to work at a Bogota radio station. The slaying 
stunned the nation and raised fears that Colombia's civil conflict 
is spiraling out of control. Garzon's death came amid growing

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the wake of NATO's bombing  
campaign against Yugoslavia that followed the crackdown in Kosovo, 
sentiment to oust Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has been 
growing. The newly named vice premier in Yugoslavia -- an 
ultranationalist appointed as part of a government reshuffle meant 
to strengthen Milosevic -- called for the president's resignation. 
On the other end of the political spectrum, Serbia's opposition 
leaders on Saturday warned Milosevic to resign or face an intense 
round of fall protests.

	Iranian Police Blamed in Campus Raid

<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Hard-line security forces and  
vigilantes have been blamed in a government inquiry into the raid 
on a student dormitory that sparked Iran's largest mass protests 
since the 1979 revolution, state-run media said Saturday. The 
report on the July 9 raid was likely to boost the standing of 
reformist President Mohammad Khatami, who had criticized the police 
raid, in his power struggle with hard-line clerics. The raid on a 
Tehran University dormitory prompted six days of nationwide 
protests demanding democratic reforms.

<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces fought Islamic  
militants in scattered skirmishes in Dagestan Saturday, suffering 
at least four deaths as officials admitted that the rebels remain 
in control of seven villages. The fighting was concentrated in the 
Caucasus region of Dagestan, a mountainous Russian republic that 
borders breakaway Chechnya. Many of the militants belong to the 
fundamentalist Wahhabi sect and are seeking an independent Islamic 
republic in the mostly Muslim regions of the Caucasus Mountains.

	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Pee Wee Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop  
and Brooklyn Dodgers captain whose leadership and example helped 
ease the way for Jackie Robinson to break baseball's color barrier, 
died Saturday. He was 81. Known for his calm leadership, 
sure-handed fielding and clutch hits, Reese sparked the Dodgers to 
seven National League pennants. He led Brooklyn to its only World 
Series championship in 1955, fielding the final ball in a 2-0 
victory in Game 7 at Yankee Stadium. Reese died at his home in 
Louisville, said Lori Young of the Pearson Funeral Home. The cause 
of death was not given.

<HEADLINE> Cassini To Buzz Earth on Saturn Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A two-story, $3.4 billion spacecraft  
carrying a load of deadly plutonium will zoom within 725 miles of 
Earth this week to gain momentum for the final leg of its 
meandering, seven-year voyage to Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassini's return, two years after NASA launched the largest and  
most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever, poses virtually no risk, 
mission officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	But anti-nuclear activists, concerned over the 72 pounds of  
carcinogenic cargo, aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is space technology can and does fail,'' said Bruce  
Gagnon of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in 
Space. ``And when you start using nuclear materials in increasing 
numbers, the odds of an accident increase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flyby at 8:28 p.m. PDT Tuesday will use Earth's gravity to  
change the probe's direction and speed relative to the sun. Without 
the ``gravity assist'' and two previous close encounters with Venus 
and a future flyby of Jupiter, the probe would never reach its 
destination in 2004 to study Saturn's rings and moons. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe will approach Earth at about 35,000 mph. Its speed  
will increase by about 11,000 mph after the swingby. At its closest 
point over the South Pacific, the probe might be visible from 
Pitcairn or the Easter islands. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has used planets' gravity to fling its probes through space  
since 1973. The plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter twice 
swung by Earth in the early 1990s at altitudes much lower than 
Cassini's closest point. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances of an accidental re-entry of Cassini are about 1 in  
1.2 million, according to a NASA estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just not a credible event,'' said Bob Mitchell, Cassini's  
program manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
``I'm not telling you it's impossible, but it's just not 
credible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Activists fear that some sort of navigation or human error could  
cause the craft to burn up in the Earth's atmosphere, showering the 
planet with deadly plutonium dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	Gagnon's group organized protests in the United States, England,  
Germany and elsewhere in June, but he admits there is little that 
can be done to change the spacecraft's course. A handful of 
anti-Cassini Web sites also have been set up. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests pale in comparison to events leading up to  
Cassini's October 1997 launch, when demonstrators threatened to 
chain themselves to the pad and filed lawsuits to stop the mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft requires plutonium not for propulsion but to  
power its dozen scientific instruments. The probe's three 
radioisotopic thermoelectric generators, or RTGs, convert heat from 
the naturally decaying plutonium into electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The units were built especially strong in case of an accident  
during launch or flyby. Each pellet is boxed in layers of heat- and 
corrosion-resistant iridium and graphite. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said for re-entry to occur, a failure aboard the probe  
would have to cause an exact change in its speed before the flyby. 
And then something would have to happen to prevent NASA from 
transmitting corrective orders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been flying this thing for two years now and we got a  
lot of practice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the capsules were to vaporize during an accidental  
re-entry, the effects on Earth's population over 50 years would be 
less than the amount of radiation from dental X-rays or a 
round-trip flight across the United States, according to NASA. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-nuclear activists, who dispute the numbers, say the space  
agency should be using safe solar energy to power all its probes. 
</P>
<P>
	But scientists point out that Saturn is 10 times as far away  
from the sun as Earth and its solar panels would have to be the 
size of two tennis courts to harness enough energy.

<HEADLINE> Former AFL-CIO Chief Kirkland Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lane Kirkland, who reunited the major U.S.  
unions during his presidency of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, died 
Saturday of lung cancer. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Irena, said Kirkland died at home nine months after  
being stricken. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland struggled against cancer for many years, losing one  
kidney and part of another to surgeries in the 1970s and '80s. Last 
June, he had a lung removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't suffer at the end,'' said Mrs. Kirkland, his wife of  
26 years. ``His body just gave out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued a statement calling Kirkland ``one of  
the towering figures in the American labor movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I valued his friendship, strong support and keen advice,''  
said Clinton. ``He was a great American and he will be greatly 
missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said Kirkland ``was truly a great man.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He had a grand vision of a strong and diverse union dedicated  
to securing not simply economic justice for working men and women 
everywhere, but social justice for all,'' said Gore. ``By finding 
strength in diversity, by working for reunification, by focusing on 
his principles and not on obstacles, he made that vision a 
reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born of southern aristocracy in Camden, S.C., and schooled in  
international relations at Georgetown University, Kirkland bucked 
the stereotypes of union leadership when he was elected AFL-CIO 
president in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics doubted the bespectacled, intellectual with his  
Roosevelt-like cigarette holder could rival his mentor and 
predecessor George Meany, a gruff, cigar-smoking Bronx plumber who 
had dominated the American labor movement for 2 1/2 decades. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kirkland, hardened at sea in the merchant marine during  
World War II and known for his salty wit, quickly emerged from 
Meany's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
	He appealed for reunification of the nation's largest and  
best-known unions under the AFL-CIO because, he said, ``all sinners 
belong in the church.'' By 1990 he had brought back the United Auto 
Workers, the Teamsters, the West Coast Longshoremen, Chemical 
Workers, Mine Workers and Locomotive Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially significant was the 1987 return of the Teamsters,  
expelled three decades earlier during the corruption scandals of 
the Dave Beck-Jimmy Hoffa era. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lane Kirkland stood shoulder to shoulder with his mentor,  
George Meany, as one of the master builders of the modern American 
labor movement,'' said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney. ``All 
workers, and especially the American union movement, will grieve 
his loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Hardesty, Kirkland's longtime spokesman at the AFL-CIO, said  
Kirkland spent a good deal of his time in recent years writing and 
working with young labor activists at the George Meany Center for 
Labor Studies in suburban Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please write that he was a great man,'' Mrs. Kirkland said.  
``He was a great man. He did so much for so many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were married the day before the second-term inauguration of  
President Nixon in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kirkland said she had not decided when her husband's  
funeral will be, but it will not be before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland oversaw a massive effort by American workers in the  
1980s to sustain the Polish Solidarity movement. Starting with the 
Gdansk shipyard strike in 1980, U.S. unions smuggled into Poland $6 
million worth of aid, much of it printing and communications 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The AFL-CIO under Kirkland reached out to workers in other  
countries where the trade union movement was suppressed, including 
South Africa, China, Cuba and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	A collector of modern paintings and sculpture, avid gardener,  
jazz buff and prolific reader, Kirkland also played political 
hardball. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1981 he organized a march that lured 250,000  
unionists and liberal allies in the civil rights movement to 
Washington to dramatize labor's opposition to Reagan administration 
cuts on a host of social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked once why the AFL-CIO had become so close to the Democratic  
Party, Kirkland replied: ``I've been standing, tippy-toe, waiting 
to be kissed (by the Republican Party), and no one has come 
forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland pushed for greater representation on the federation's  
top policy-making body of minorities and women. It had been 
historically dominated by white, middle-aged men. 
</P>
<P>
	When Geraldine Ferraro became Walter Mondale's running mate in  
his quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984, 
Kirkland bristled at suggestions that union members might not 
support a ticket with a female candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are two kinds of people in the labor movement: women,  
and people who like women,'' Kirkland told a caucus of labor 
delegates during the Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the unions Kirkland helped bring back into the  
AFL-CIO fold, total membership in the federation stayed almost flat 
during his tenure. Union membership declined steadily as a 
percentage of the U.S. labor force. 
</P>
<P>
	The era was beset by crises for unions, from President Reagan's  
firing of striking federal air traffic controllers to declines in 
heavily unionized industries such as manufacturing, mining and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland resigned as AFL-CIO president in August 1995, bowing to  
demands from some leaders of major unions for change. Criticism of 
the AFL-CIO's political activity, organizing and media relations 
was spurred by the Republican takeover of Congress in the 1994 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Born on March 12, 1922, Joseph Lane Kirkland was heir to a long  
line of Camden cotton growers whose roots date back 200 years to 
the American Revolution. A great-great-grandfather signed the 
Declaration of Causes, in which South Carolina sought to explain 
its secession from the union, and sat in the Confederate Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	When World War II broke out, Kirkland, still a teen-ager,  
enrolled in the first class of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at 
Kings Point, N.Y., and later served as an officer on ships carrying 
ammunition and tanks to battle zones. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, he drew sailing charts for the Navy while going  
to night school at Georgetown, where he studied to enter the 
foreign service and received a bachelor of science degree in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland changed his plans on graduation, however, taking a job  
in the research department at the American Federation of Labor. His 
only previous connection with organized labor was as a member of 
the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, an AFL 
affiliate, during the war years. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the federation in 1958 to do research for the  
International Union of Operating Engineers but rejoined it two 
years later as Meany's executive assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland was elevated in 1969 to AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer,  
the federation's number two job. He was Meany's chosen successor, 
was elected president without opposition in 1979 and went on to 
serve eight two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, President Clinton awarded Kirkland the Presidential  
Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirkland's marriage to his first wife, with whom he had five  
daughters, ended in divorce. In 1973, he married the former Irena 
Neumann, a Czechoslovakian who survived the Nazi concentration camp 
at Buchenwald. They lived in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirland's five children are Lucy Schoenfeld, Blair Hull, Rikki  
Condon, Holly Simon and Katherine Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	Other surviors include five grandchildren and two  
great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Arrested in 1958 NJ Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) -- Theodore Schiffer got away with murder  
for nearly 41 years, prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, after help from an informant, authorities have charged  
Schiffer with the 1958 killing of Rahway police officer Charles 
Bernoskie. 
</P>
<P>
	The 61-year-old carpet installer was arrested Thursday at his  
home in Peckville, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to use the word unbelievable,'' said Bernoskie's  
son, Charles Bernoskie, who was nearly 5 when his father was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest ``just brings a little bit of closure,'' Bernoskie  
said. ``It's an answer that you have to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernoskie, 30, was shot three times when he confronted two men  
robbing a car dealership. He had emptied his service revolver. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators had little more than the statements of two  
witnesses who saw two young men leaving the dealership, and 
fingerprints. The witnesses are now dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Union County Prosecutor Thomas Manahan said the Postal Service  
recently gave authorities a lead to someone who led them to 
Schiffer. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	But a police affidavit obtained by The Scranton (Pa.) Times  
quotes a woman named Judith Sapsa as saying Schiffer and her 
brother, Robert Zarinsky, came to her home with gunshot wounds on 
the night Bernoskie was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Sapsa said her mother treated their wounds, and Zarinsky told  
her that he shot Bernoskie after the officer shot Schiffer, the 
affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiffer's fingerprints match the prints from the murder scene,  
and police found a scar on his chest where Sapsa said a bullet had 
been removed, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed against Zarinsky, who is serving a  
life prison term for murdering a 17-year-old girl.

<HEADLINE> New Computer Is Size of an Aspirin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The latest from the cyberworld: an  
aspirin-size computer that, embedded in household appliances, could 
let people on the road or at the office use the Internet to cool 
their homes, heat coffee and tape TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Believed to be the smallest such computer ever built, the  
inexpensive device could help usher in a new generation of 
connected home appliances, from VCRs to coffee makers to small 
cameras, controlled over the Internet from almost anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The implications of this are more than a silly little  
competition among a bunch of researchers,'' said H. Shrikumar, who 
studies specialized machine automation at the University of 
Massachusetts in Amherst. ``This has tremendous application in the 
way it might change our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The project also testifies to how much utility a concise  
programmer can pack into a limited amount of computer memory, even 
in these days of multimegabyte software applications with millions 
of lines of code. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny computer, slightly larger than the head of a match, is  
connected to the Internet from Shrikumar's apartment near the 
university. It includes a tiny 4-megahertz processor he bought for 
49 cents and a small 32-kilobyte memory chip that stores World Wide 
Web pages and other data. 
</P>
<P>
	Although those numbers are paltry compared to the speed and  
storage of modern personal computers, which run thousands of times 
faster and contain hundreds of times more storage, the tiny 
computer still is more powerful than typical computers less than a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrikumar, 33, said his computer can be built for less than $1,  
making it practical to install the devices in a variety of home 
electronics and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Some existing appliances, such as modern thermostats or newer  
coffee makers, can be programmed individually. But appliances 
connected using the language of the Internet, called ``TCP/IP,'' 
could communicate with each other even if made by different 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the hour the homeowner sets for his alarm clock, for  
example, the thermostat could automatically turn up the heat, the 
television could turn on the morning news and the coffee could 
begin brewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one click, the whole house now wakes up with you,'' he  
said. ``This can make our way of life much easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, with the appliances connected to a home network that  
also maintained a continuous connection with the Internet, 
consumers could use the Web browser on an office computer to 
program their VCRs, turn on their porch lights, even activate 
cameras to check on the baby sitter. 
</P>
<P>
	The new wave of high-speed Internet connections using cable TV  
modems or new digital phone lines already offer such continuous 
hookups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I want a computer in my refrigerator that's  
controllable, but the heating system, that's a legitimate one 
you'll want to control,'' said Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap 
Software Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., who built the first small 
Internet computer more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could solve the problem of programming the VCR. You could  
have more sophisticated control mechanisms, have different time 
schedules on the weekdays,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrikumar's Internet computer is smaller than one built earlier  
this year at Stanford University, which includes a much more 
powerful processor and lots more memory. But the Stanford computer 
costs more than $800. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughan Pratt, the Stanford professor in charge of that project,  
said the implications of Shrikumar's work are enormous. 
``Everything that shrinks down to a size that can be embedded in 
small spaces will have a big impact,'' Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Shrikumar began testing his computer this summer, and  
after he announced it on a private Internet discussion group, about 
5,000 people daily from around 70 countries have visited the tiny 
computer's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was just a fun hobby project,'' said Shrikumar, who  
expects to graduate next year. ``It caught my attention and 
demanded that it be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is not sure what he will do once he leaves school.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are lots of things one can do,'' he said. ``It's a big  
world.''

<HEADLINE> Boss and E Street Band Born Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- In '75, they were ``Born to Run'';  
nine years later they were ``Born in the USA.'' This summer, Bruce 
Springsteen and the E Street Band -- dormant for the most of the 
past decade -- were born again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rebirth and rededication of our band,'' Springsteen  
said Thursday at the last show of his 15-night, sold-out New Jersey 
homecoming. ``We will continue to serve you as best we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300,000 fans heard the Boss at the Meadowlands area --  
the first leg of Springsteen and the band's first U.S. tour 
together since 1988's ``Tunnel of Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Good evening, New Jersey. We're going to bring it to you,''  
Springsteen, 49, said on Night No. 1 before launching into ``My 
Love Will Not Bring You Down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a month later, on Night No. 15, Springsteen teasingly  
asked, ``How can I say thanks?'' -- and then closed his stay with a 
blistering ``Rosalita.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be seeing you after a while,'' the Freehold, N.J.,  
native promised the rabid crowd, which had long wondered if a 
reunion between the Boss and the band would ever occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce and the band blasted anthems like ``Born to Run'' and  
``Backstreets.'' They trotted out obscure gems like ``Loose Ends'' 
and ``Frankie.'' Springsteen unveiled new material, too -- the 
show-closer ``Land of Hope and Dreams,'' along with a 
semi-autobiographical, semi-comical number called ``Freehold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen even took time to reveal the meaning of life: ``Cold  
beer at a reasonable price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans were ecstatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``The legend is there,'' said Ed Cronin, 39, who traveled down  
from Massachusetts to see his 41st Springsteen show. ``He's like 
Michael Jordan, Babe Ruth -- you can only compare Bruce to 
himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The critics were just as effusive.  
</P>
<P>
	``The legend ... came back to life in New Jersey last night, its  
power and promise undiminished by the passage of time,'' wrote Dan 
DeLuca of The Philadelphia Inquirer after opening night. 
</P>
<P>
	This was no nostalgia tour; until the last night, Springsteen  
ignored fans holding signs demanding his old show-closer, 
``Rosalita.'' The Boss had no new album to support, no new product 
to push (although the Jersey stand netted some $18 million in 
ticket sales alone). 
</P>
<P>
	The homecoming shows were the summer's hottest ticket, with  
desperate fans flooding phone lines with 15,000 calls per minute 
when the dates were announced. The first 10 shows, more than 
200,000 tickets, sold out in just five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Meadowlands officials acknowledged that Springsteen could have  
easily sold out more shows. As it was, the 15 dates in a single 
arena set an industry record, besting Springsteen's old mark of 11 
shows from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour, after a short hiatus, next hits Boston on Aug. 21  
before continuing to Washington, Detroit, Philadelphia and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	On the last night in New Jersey, after ripping through 24 songs,  
Springsteen thanked the crowd effusively. Behind the stage, amid 
the cascading cheers, two young girls returned the favor, holding 
up a simple sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you,'' it read.

<HEADLINE> Raiders Give Wheatley a 3rd Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Tyrone Wheatley never really fit during  
four unhappy seasons with the New York Giants, and was traded to 
Miami. He never got much of an opportunity with the Dolphins, who 
cut him early in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Wheatley is with the Oakland Raiders, a team that has made a  
tradition of trying to rehabilitate other clubs' castoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The running back may get an opportunity to show why he was the  
17th pick overall in the 1995 draft when the Raiders play host to 
the Dallas Cowboys in an exhibition game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In practices, he has impressed the Raiders with his power.  
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't had a chance to play much the last couple of years.  
We're not going to judge Tyrone Wheatley on his past at all. We're 
going to judge him on what he does here,'' coach Jon Gruden said. 
``He's been a real pleasant surprise for us. We're happy with the 
things he's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wheatley, who also may get to return kickoffs, is vying for one  
of the backup spots behind starter Napoleon Kaufman. Among the 
other contenders is former Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam, 
who is expected to play against Dallas despite a tender hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	The game also will give the Raiders a chance to look at wide  
receiver and kick returner Aaron Bailey, who spent five seasons 
with the Indianapolis Colts and was signed this week by Oakland as 
a free agent because injuries have depleted the team's receiving 
corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, which lost 20-17 in overtime to the Cleveland Browns on  
Monday night, will use the game to get another look at five young 
receivers competing for perhaps two roster spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates are fourth-round pick Wane McGarity, sixth-round  
selection MarTay Jenkins and free agents John Washington, Jason 
Tucker and Deon Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity had a 15-yard reception on Dallas' first scoring drive.  
Jenkins scored on a 35-yard touchdown pass. Washington tied for the 
team high with four catches, and Tucker had one catch for 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	McGarity's chances of making the squad may be helped by some  
praise he has received from quarterback Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
	``He does some really nice things as far as running routes,''  
Aikman said. ``Even if the ball isn't caught, he's always right 
there in contention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to evaluating young players, Cowboys coach Chan  
Gailey also hopes to play a cleaner game. In the loss to the 
Browns, the Cowboys were penalized 17 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been emphasizing it, we've been talking about it,''  
Gailey said. ``Certain ones you can understand, but you can't come 
up with too many reasons. You start getting reasons and reasons 
turn to excuses. We have committed to eliminate the problem before 
we get too far down the road.''

<HEADLINE> 'Blair Witch' Star Likes Camping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Starring in ``The Blair Witch Project'' hasn't  
ruined camping out for experience for Heather Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent film that has become a mainstream summer hit  
tells the story of young filmmakers who hike into the wilderness to 
document tales of a mythic witch haunting the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've actually become a very active camper,'' Donahue says in  
Aug. 20-22 issue of USA Weekend magazine, ``which surprises people, 
because they get so scared watching the movie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donahue was one of three unknown actors now enjoying the  
unexpected box office success of the movie shot by two student 
filmmakers for about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	She has some advice for those venturing into the woods so they  
don't end up like the characters in ``The Blair Witch Project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Bring a good, easy-to-read map, a compass and a cell phone,''  
she said.
