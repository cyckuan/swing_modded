   PHOENIX - Olympic gold medalist Gary Hall Jr. will be able to
compete again after FINA, the international swimming federation,
ended his provisional probation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' was unable to reach Hall, but his
prepared statement said, ``I am pleased that the situation with
FINA has been resolved. It allows me to concentrate properly on
what I believe I do best _ competitive swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, 25, was placed on provisional probation after he tested
positive for marijuana on a May 15 drug test. He has said he is
innocent of violating FINA regulations and had asked FINA to give
him a hearing before its doping panel.
</P>
<P>
   But the waiving of the suspension comes too late for him to
participate in the National Championships, which end today in
Clovis, Calif. The championships are considered a steppingstone to
the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Swim Club athlete won four medals in the 1996
Atlanta games and is considered the best sprinter in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He tested positive for marijuana at the Atlanta games, but there
was a legal question as to whether a violation was committed, since
FINA only banned marijuana use around that time period. &QL;

SINGH TAKES LEAD AT PGA CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Traditionally, the PGA Championship is the weak
sister of the four majors. At the U.S. and British opens, par is a
good score, as it was this year. The Masters champ usually finishes
somewhere in the 8- to 10-under range, like the 9-under that won it
earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA? In the last five years, the average winning score has
been 12.5 under. Not good, considering the majors like to pride
themselves for their tenacity. Hey, these are not supposed to be
one of those ``let's take it deep'' PGA Tour shows.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there were reservations about little-known Sahalee
Country Club, primarily because the only research in the past had
been on woodpeckers and termites and their impact on club's tall
timbers. This was Sahalee's debut into tournament golf, and
organizers were not sure if the world's best players were facing a
hurricane or a light breeze from this course that lies near the
Pugent Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, Sahalee is a fairly stern gale. At least that's what
the results indicate after Vijay Singh emerged Friday as the leader
at the midpoint. His 4-under 66 was good enough for a 1-shot
advantage over Colin Montgomerie, Steve Stricker and Scott Gump.
</P>
<P>
   It also was the same score that Tiger Woods had recorded the day
before, and Woods and Singh both had to shoot course records to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions (the guys who missed the cut), the
tightness of these tree-lined fairways has virtually taken the
driver out of most players' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even hitting irons off the tee, it's not a gimme that you're
going to put it on the fairways,'' said Singh, who birdied three of
the first four holes, and five of the first nine, before Sahalee
snapped back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to hit really good shots on the correct side of the
fairway to score. Nothing's stopping you from hitting driver, but
the problem is keeping it on the short stuff (grass). The fairways
are so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods agreed, and even issued a warning for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course is really drying out, like a British Open. The
greens and fairways are brown in spots, and if they don't put any
water on them, it's going to be really hard to shoot a low number
the next two days,'' said Woods, who never got it going on his way
to a 72 that pushed him back to 2 under.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, the bombastic Scot, had his own prediction after a
67.
</P>
<P>
   ``The championship will be determined on Sunday at the 18th.
There's no question about that,'' said inpregnable ``Monty,'' who
would have shared the lead with Singh if not for a bogey at that
475-yard, uphill par 4. ``You could almost call the course a par 71
because of that hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker had the lead late in the day at 5 under until a 5-iron
into the water at the 17th resulted in a double-bogey 5. He ended
up with a 68, long after the TV cameras had shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee's fear factor seemed to be escalating among everyone
except Gump, who has a little bit of Forrest in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the course, and I don't feel any pressure,'' reported
the laidback pro from Florida, who has one top-10 finish this
season. ``Trying to make the cut, that's pressure. But playing well
in the PGA, that's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Five players were at 2 under, including defending champ Davis
Love, who shot an erratic 68. Also at that number was Scottsdale's
Andrew Magee, whose 68 was much more even-keeled behind three
birdies and a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Phoenix-area pros were 4 shots off the pace. Phil
Mickelson rallied on the back nine with three birdies for his
second straight 70. And Billy Mayfair, last week's winner of the
Buick Open, turned around a 73 in the opening round with a 67, the
second-best score of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The cut came at 5 over. One of those who did not advance was
Stuart Appleby, who was playing for the first time since his wife,
Renay, was killed in a freak accident in London three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not glad it's over,'' said Appleby, who was 10 over after
a 73. ``But again, I'm not expecting great things.''
</P>
<P>
   Those will have to come from others on a course that grows
quicker by the minute. Perhaps someone like Mark O'Meara, who is
attempting to become the first player to win three major
championships since Ben Hogan in 1953. The Masters and British Open
champ is 1 under after a 70.
</P>
<P>
   Now that would be truly a great thing. &QL;

NEW YORK SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR LIKELY TO GET $50,000 RAISE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew would be paid more than
any other top school administrator in the country _ as well as
President Clinton _ under a new contract the Board of Education is
likely to approve on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed contract, which would be retroactive to July 1,
raises Crew's salary 25.6 percent, to $245,000 a year from
$195,000. Crew already earns more than Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
($165,000) and Gov. George Pataki ($130,000), and his new salary
would surpass Clinton's base salary of $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The contract would also extend Crew's tenure. The old contract
was scheduled to expire next July 1. Under the new contract, Crew
would have to stay until June 30, 2000, with the option of two
one-year extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Board officials said the raise was needed to remain competitive
with other urban school districts and to bring stability to a
position that has seen 11 occupants in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The salary of the schools chancellor, who oversees a system with
1.1 million students, 63,500 teachers and a $9-billion budget, has
remained the same since 1990. In addition to his salary, Crew lives
in a Brooklyn Heights brownstone owned by the board and, when on
school business, has the use of a car and driver.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Thompson Jr., the board president, said he and the
chancellor had discussed the terms of the contract in recent
months. He said Crew, who was appointed in October 1995, was not
job hunting but wanted greater compensation for what he considered
an increasingly difficult job. Aides to Thompson said the board
president had secured the votes to approve the contract.
</P>
<P>
   If Crew stayed for the new contract's minimum of two years, his
six-year tenure would make him the longest-serving New York schools
chief in 40 years. Thompson said that Crew intended to stay for the
contract's full four years.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the chancellor said he would leave a few months
before the next mayoral election, in November 2001. Giuliani, with
whom Crew has a close relationship, is barred from seeking a third
term and the chancellor has said he does not want to work with
another mayor. The two one-year options were included to allow the
chancellor the flexibility to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Crew was unavailable for comment Friday, said a spokesman, J.D.
La Rock. Colleen Roche, a spokesman for Giuliani, said the mayor
would not comment on Crew's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said a national survey conducted by the board showed
that Crew earned more than any other chief school administrator
aside from Robert C. Cuevas, the superintendent of the Miami-Dade
County Public Schools, whose salary was $199,800. The school system
in Miami, with an enrollment of 331,000 and a $3-billion budget, is
the nation's fourth largest _ trailing those in New York, which has
the largest, Los Angeles, and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   While the average salary for a superintendent, according to the
American Association of School Administrators, is $94,000, Thompson
said many smaller urban districts pay their chief executives
salaries that approach Crew's. Seattle, for example, pays its
superintendent $186,000 to oversee a system with 44,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the result of Rudy being happy with the job he
is doing and helping to change the school system, and this board
being very happy with him,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson cited the rise in reading and math test scores on city
exams, which he said was a better gauge of students' performance
than recent state exams that showed a downturn, as well as Crew's
success in winning broader powers from Albany to hire and fire
local district superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   The contract extension, he said, would allow Crew to follow
through on a number of changes he has begun, including ending the
automatic promotion of schoolchildren to the next grade if they
have not demonstrated competency in basic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Levy, executive vice president of the principals' union,
the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, called the timing of
the raise insensitive because the union and the board have failed
to agree on a contract during the last two years. But Ms. Levy said
she did not take issue with the new salary, which is about three
times the amount a high school principal makes a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, if they want stability and continuity in the system
and they are pleased with his job, he ought to be compensated and
validated by giving him a contract,'' Ms. Levy said. ``But it is
unfortunate they have not expressed the same feeling toward school
leaders.''

TRUE SORROW NOT FROM LOUSY ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Redmond, Wash - Golfers mourn missed putts. Double bogeys are
heart-wrenching tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   Then Stuart Appleby looked at us with those haunted blue eyes.
Steeling himself, summoning his courage, he gazed around the room
and politely invited our questions. Though he dreaded it, he needed
to do it. It was time. Go ahead, he urged, breaking the silence.
``Don't be shy.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the usual press tent interview in which a player is
quizzed about his putting problems or an errant tee shot.
</P>
<P>
   Three days ago, Appleby spoke publicly for the first time about
a real tragedy. His sorrow and tears reminded us what we forget.
Sports aren't life and death. Golf? It's a ``game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bravely, as best he could, the 27-year-old Australian put words
to his deepest feelings. He spoke of Renay. He talked openly about
the task of learning to accept the reality that he will spend the
rest of his life without her.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Appleby's wife was struck by a taxi as she
unloaded luggage outside a London train station. She died before
her husband's eyes. Married two years, the couple was going to
Paris for a second honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral in Australia. Flowers. The notes of condolences are a
blur. Emotionally numb, Appleby was unprepared to play golf when he
showed up this week for the PGA Championship. He hadn't hit a ball
since Renay's death July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Appleby played because tournament golf is what he does for a
living. He needed to resume his life, even if his heart wasn't in
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed to get out again,'' he said. Also, part of him
wanted to reassure those who care about him most, to tell them by
taking the first step that he will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   It never was Appleby's intention for this to be a public
spectacle. TV cameras trailed him around the course. In the
gallery, where his wife would have been following on every hole, he
felt the sympathetic stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much attention,'' he said, ``for reasons I really didn't
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf is a mental game. Appleby couldn't give it his undivided
attention, nor did he expect to. His mind wandered as he trudged
around the course, a solitary figure, head bowed. After he shot 77
in the first round, Appleby's caddie said what was painfully
obvious: ``Stuart wasn't really himself.''
</P>
<P>
   As a golfer, he is a robot right now, although Friday he felt
himself smile. Appleby rolled in a 40-footer for birdie at No. 17.
Then, on the final hole, a monster par 4, he stood over his ball
below the green, about 60 feet from the cup. The gallery hushed
itself as the bearded golfer drew back his wedge and struck his
third shot.
</P>
<P>
   The ball hopped onto the putting surface and began rolling
directly toward the flagstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it happen,'' a man standing next to me whispered.
</P>
<P>
   The ball kept rolling, rolling, closer now . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it happen. . . . Let it HAPPEN!''
</P>
<P>
   And it did.
</P>
<P>
   I saw a golf ball ``wished'' into the hole. Surprised, Appleby
broke into a smile and raised his arms in thanks, thanks for a
birdie, and for the warm outpouring of support.
</P>
<P>
   Healing?
</P>
<P>
   His fingers touched the silver necklace he wore, the one made of
small squares that spell out his wife's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose you could call this week a step in the healing
process,'' Appleby said, a note of caution in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   He is playing golf again. There's a tournament next week, and
another the week after before he makes the trip he dreads, back to
Orlando. For the first time since burying his wife, he will unlock
the front door and step into an empty house, their dream house _
her ``pride and joy'' _ and listen to awful sounds of silence. &QL;

RATTLERS SET TO DUEL PREDATORS  
 ARENABOWL, NATIONAL EXPOSURE AWAIT WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Here they meet again, the Rattlers and the Orlando
Predators, this time with the most historic ArenaBowl date in the
league's 12-year history at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Loser goes home. Winner gets to play Aug. 23 in the first
nationally network-televised Arena football game at Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   You think none of these guys wants a piece of that exposure?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be enormous,'' Rattlers quarterback Sherdrick Bonner
said. ``This is probably the biggest game in the franchise right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's 5 p.m. semifinal at America West Arena is even bigger
than last year's championship, when the Rattlers ripped the Iowa
Barnstormers at home. Bigger than '94, when the Rattlers captured
their first ArenaBowl with the greatest upset in league history,
36-31, over a seemingly invincible Orlando team at ``The Jungle'' _
the name the Predators like to call their home arena.
</P>
<P>
   These guys just can't seem to get away from each other. Two
years ago, the Rattlers beat Orlando again in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think the Predators have forgotten for a second their past
two playoffs losses to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a Rattler fan, but even though I'm a Rattler
fan, I want to beat them that much more,'' Scottsdale resident and
Predators Chairman Will Meris said. ``I think we're still looking
for redemption after being the big favorite in '94.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando never has won the big trophy, something the Rattlers
have earned twice and something the Predators' archrival, the Tampa
Bay Storm, has done four times.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Gruden, a new, young coach who quarterbacked the Storm to
those four championships, brought in 13 rookies and injected a
championship energy in the Predators, who possess the league's
second-best defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week was probably the best game we played all year,''
Gruden said of his team's 58-43 victory over the Nashville Kats.
The Rattlers couldn't stop the Kats until the last series the week
before, when the Rattlers won, 59-54.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes down to whether we can turn it up and keep the level
of intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers haven't forgotten June 20, when they lost to
Orlando, 42-40, at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It was their last loss at home, and Calvin Schexnayder turned in
his worst game, gaining only 77 receiving yards. He was a
non-factor against a secondary led by Kenny McEntyre, Damon Mason
and Chris Barbers.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Danny White is sickened even when he watches tape of that
game. He sees receiver Randy Gatewood was ejected just before
halftime for brushing an official. He sees lineman Tony Henderson
knocked unconscious on the same play. He sees how the offense
continually broke down because of missed blocking assignments and
dropped passes, and he sees how a fumbled kickoff resulted in an
Orlando score.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-scoring offense at the time was shut out in the
first quarter, something that had not happened before to the
Rattlers, even during their expansion year in '92, when the
Predators whipped them, 71-21. That score remains a team record for
the largest margin of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But White said losing at home doesn't add incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that they beat us,'' he said. ``We have a chance
to go one up on them. We have a chance to turn the tables.''
</P>
<P>
   Count on Gatewood, who caught the winning touchdown pass in
overtime against Tampa Bay in last year's semifinals, to stay away
from the officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner just wants to finish. He became a spectator at last
year's ArenaBowl after suffering a broken leg in the fourth quarter
of the semifinal game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, we can't shoot ourselves,'' Gatewood said.
``The last time we played Orlando, that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Meris, who had some Orlando players over Friday night to watch
Tampa Bay beat New Jersey, 49-23, in a semifinal, said the
Predators' goals are to beat Arizona and ``to sack Bonner.'' Bonner
has gone 34 straight games without a sack. &QL;

NO SHORTAGE OF RECEIVERS  
 EXPERIENCED WI DEOUTS GIVE ASU SOME DEPTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BECKY GRUHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAYSON, Ariz. _ Tariq McDonald doesn't need preseason magazines
to tell him where Arizona State's receiving corps ranks in college
football. He thinks the answer is, well, rather obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the best corps in the nation,'' the sophomore
receiver said. ``I feel that real deep in my heart. I think we have
the most talent and most experience coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   While McDonald's assesment may be hard to prove, a quick glance
at the Sun Devils' roster does give the bold statement some
validity.
</P>
<P>
   All-American candidate Lenzie Jackson and senior Kenny Mitchell,
the top receivers a year ago, are two of seven true receivers who
return after seeing considerable action last fall. In fact, ASU
didn't lose a player at the position from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of veteran players who know the game,'' Jackson
said. ``We have a lot of versatility. We have the deep threat, the
possession receivers and the little quick guys who can get the
first downs.''
</P>
<P>
   But greeting all those familiar faces at Camp Tontozona hasn't
convinced Sun Devils Coach Bruce Snyder that he has enough depth at
receiver. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe I see it different than some people,'' Snyder
said. ``I think our front-line players are very talented, but we
have some questions still to answer beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   One lingering question will be whether senior wideout Ricky
Boyer will see action this season. Boyer did not make the trip to
Camp Tontozona because of academic difficulties, but receivers
coach Robin Pflugrad doesn't want to rule out Boyer's return this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is working on some situations that he has to improve
upon academically,'' Pflugrad said. ``He's working on it
day-to-day. It's really going to depend on how well he accomplishes
some of the tasks he has to get done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really out of my hands. I don't know if he'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyer, nicknamed ``The Rocket'' because of his speed, caught 21
passes last season, averaged 13.6 yards a reception and scored four
touchdowns. He also rushed for 85 yards on seven carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying for him; we need him out here,'' Jackson said.
``He came in with me and Kenny (Mitchell), and I want to leave with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Boyer doesn't return, Pflugrad is left with six
receivers who played in 1997. For Pflugrad it creates a nice
scenario, but still far from ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we know we have enough people that we'll get better
and be capable of making big plays,'' he said, ``and hopefully that
will be able to take a little bit of the pressure off Jackson. But
as a coach you can never have enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you're satisfied as a coach, you should really
probably retire and go fly-fishing or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has already locked up one of the starting positions. The
6-foot senior was quarterback Ryan Kealy's favorite target last
year, leading the receivers with 53 completions for 733 yards and
five touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Pflugrad has yet to determine who will start opposite Jackson.
Mitchell, McDonald, sophomore Brian Forth and senior Creig Spann
are all likely candidates. However, McDonald appears to have a
slight edge in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 sophomore has been running routes with Kealy at the
helm ever since high school when the two teamed up to lead St.
Mary's to the 1995 Class 5A state championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives me an advantage, but Ryan's such a good quarterback
he works well with all the receivers,'' McDonald said. ``If I go
out there and compete and maintain what I did in spring ball, I
think the starting job is mine to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   That prediction may be a bit easier to prove. &QL;

NO SHORTAGE OF RECEIVERS  
 EXPERIENCED WIDEOUTS GIVE ASU SOME DEPTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BECKY GRUHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAYSON, Ariz. _ Tariq McDonald doesn't need preseason magazines
to tell him where Arizona State's receiving corps ranks in college
football. He thinks the answer is, well, rather obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the best corps in the nation,'' the sophomore
receiver said. ``I feel that real deep in my heart. I think we have
the most talent and most experience coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   While McDonald's assesment may be hard to prove, a quick glance
at the Sun Devils' roster does give the bold statement some
validity.
</P>
<P>
   All-American candidate Lenzie Jackson and senior Kenny Mitchell,
the top receivers a year ago, are two of seven true receivers who
return after seeing considerable action last fall. In fact, ASU
didn't lose a player at the position from last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of veteran players who know the game,'' Jackson
said. ``We have a lot of versatility. We have the deep threat, the
possession receivers and the little quick guys who can get the
first downs.''
</P>
<P>
   But greeting all those familiar faces at Camp Tontozona hasn't
convinced Sun Devils Coach Bruce Snyder that he has enough depth at
receiver. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe I see it different than some people,'' Snyder
said. ``I think our front-line players are very talented, but we
have some questions still to answer beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   One lingering question will be whether senior wideout Ricky
Boyer will see action this season. Boyer did not make the trip to
Camp Tontozona because of academic difficulties, but receivers
coach Robin Pflugrad doesn't want to rule out Boyer's return this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is working on some situations that he has to improve
upon academically,'' Pflugrad said. ``He's working on it
day-to-day. It's really going to depend on how well he accomplishes
some of the tasks he has to get done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really out of my hands. I don't know if he'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyer, nicknamed ``The Rocket'' because of his speed, caught 21
passes last season, averaged 13.6 yards a reception and scored four
touchdowns. He also rushed for 85 yards on seven carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm praying for him; we need him out here,'' Jackson said.
``He came in with me and Kenny (Mitchell), and I want to leave with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Boyer doesn't return, Pflugrad is left with six
receivers who played in 1997. For Pflugrad it creates a nice
scenario, but still far from ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we know we have enough people that we'll get better
and be capable of making big plays,'' he said, ``and hopefully that
will be able to take a little bit of the pressure off Jackson. But
as a coach you can never have enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you're satisfied as a coach, you should really
probably retire and go fly-fishing or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has already locked up one of the starting positions. The
6-foot senior was quarterback Ryan Kealy's favorite target last

LEES FERRY LIMITS ESTAB LISHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a series of public meetings, the Arizona Game and Fish
Department has decided how it wants to manage the trout fishery at
Lees Ferry on the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   Lees Ferry, a 15-mile stretch below Lake Powell, is considered
one of the best tail water (below a dam) trout fisheries in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would establish a 16-inch maximum limit for trout,
meaning no fish more than 16 inches long could be kept. There would
be a daily bag limit of two trout and a possession limit of four.
</P>
<P>
   The department said the recommendation is based on fish
populations, law enforcement needs, public input and the ability of
the department to evaluate the fishery.
</P>
<P>
   The five public meetings seeking input on management changes
were not heavily attended, but Joe Janisch, head of fisheries for
the department, said comments at those meetings were consistent
with the comments from thousands of anglers interviewed during
creel surveys at the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different groups have different likes and dislikes,'' he said.
``The comments we heard at the public meetings reaffirm what we've
already heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the people have done is give us a vision of a quality
fishery and how to attack it.''
</P>
<P>
   Janisch said the department believes the new regulations will
meet most angler needs and all of the following biological
objectives:
</P>
<P>
   Maintain an average catch rate of not less than 0.6 fish an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Maintain fish in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Allow the fish to reach 16 inches in length or larger by their
third year.
</P>
<P>
   Sustain the fishery through natural reproduction, stocking only
when poor reproduction years threaten biological objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Monitor the populations of both native fish and rainbow trout.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of trout &QL; 
Montana usually is considered a model for trout management by trout
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Following are four tips that the state's wildlife management
agency provides to help ensure a healthy trout population:
</P>
<P>
   Don't disturb spawning trout. Be careful not to disturb fish
nests (redds). Fish carefully during spawning season so spawning
fish are not disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   At Lees Ferry in Arizona, fishing the redds is the primary way
of catching trout. If disturbing redds hinders natural
reproduction, there are serious problems at Lees Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Use particular caution when fishing warmer waters. Trout become
stressed when water temperatures exceed 62 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Lees Ferry, it would be difficult to find trout
waters in Arizona that didn't exceed 62 degrees in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   If you practice catch-and-release fishing, improve your
techniques to reduce stress on fish. Use hook-removal tools and
soft, wet gloves, or at least wet your hands if you must handle a
trout.
</P>
<P>
   Limit your catch, whether you practice catch-and-release
techniques or not. &QL;

BOAT BACK 7 WEEKS AFTER CRASH  
 HAS FALLEN TO 12TH PLACE BUT SEES SHOT AT IRL TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's back to the future for Billy Boat, thankful his broken left
leg and pelvis have healed sufficiently to allow a return to the
driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, seven weeks off has felt like seven years, Boat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I was adamant about coming back so quickly,'' said
Boat, whose two-race absence will end Sunday in the Radisson 200 at
Pikes Peak International Raceway. ``The longer you're out, the
longer it takes to get your rhythm back.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat suffered the injury June 28 in an Indy Racing League event
at New Hampshire International Speedway, when a car driven by Raul
Boesel pierced Boat's car and struck his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went right through the side of the car, and the nose hit me
in the thigh,'' said Boat, who lives in Glendale. ``I'm not going
to sit here and tell you that I can't still see that nose sticking
into the car, but it's something you put out of your mind because
you have to go out and do your job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been racing all my life and I've had injuries before.
It's just a situation where you get right back on the horse and go
do it again. I've got no trepidation at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Boat made his return July 28-29, when he tested at
Atlanta Motor Speedway. Boat recorded a top speed of 220.95 mph
during the test, then two weeks ago, tested again at Texas Motor
Speedway, where he topped out at a similar speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, my leg was a little weak and it took some effort to
work the clutch,'' said Boat, whose leg was repaired with an
L-shaped plate and several screws. ``But it was a lot better at
Texas. I didn't experience any pain at all. Actually, it felt
better on the racetrack than it did sitting still.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Ray substituted for Boat while he was away, recording
finishes of 15th at Dover Downs (Del.) International Raceway and
17th at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ray take over was disconcerting, Boat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like somebody taking your girlfriend to the prom,''
Boat said. ``You know you should be there, but you can't.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part is we have such a great race team and a great
chance to win every time we go out there. You hate to have those
opportunities slip by.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Boat won't attempt to ease back into the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've had a couple of chances to test, I feel very
comfortable in the car,'' said Boat, who has slipped from fourth to
12th in the IRL drivers standings and trails series leader Scott
Sharp by nearly 100 points (214-122).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to have any type of (learning) curve coming
back at all. I think I'll be right back up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like we've got a chance to win the championship,
and with only four races left, that's not enough time to ease back
into it. We'll be jumping in with both feet.'' &QL;

ARIZONANS CONSIDERED RISING TRANS-AM STARS  
 ROOKIES WINLESS BUT 3RD, 7TH IN DRIVER STANDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should they choose to stay put, Phoenix-area drivers Chris
Neville and Ross Thompson have been endorsed as potential Sports
Car Club of America Trans-Am stars.
</P>
<P>
   Who says?
</P>
<P>
   Bill Saunders, one of the circuit's top drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ``will'' be stars if they decide to stay in Trans-Am,''
said Saunders, who trails only teammate Paul Gentilozzi in the
driver standings with three races remaining this season. ``They're
terrific young men. A lot of times, new drivers come in and have
attitudes that are difficult to deal with. These two guys are the
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've adapted to Trans-Am, and it's not that easy to adapt
to these cars.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Neville has adapted slightly quicker than
Thompson, who has fallen down the driving ladder after mixing it up
with the leaders through much of the first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Poor finishes due to mechanical failures or rotten luck have
dropped Thompson, who attended Corona del Sol High School, to
seventh in the overall driver standings and third in the rookie
points chase.
</P>
<P>
   Neville, who lives in Scottsdale, has a large lead in the rookie
standings and is in third place overall, only two points behind
Saunders, who trails Gentilozzi by 70 points.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Neville nor Thompson has won, hardly a sin for the two
rookies. Gentilozzi (seven) and Saunders (two) have combined to win
nine of 10 races. Lou Gigliotti has the other victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a chance to catch (Saunders), but (Gentilozzi) is
running away with it,'' Neville said. ``That team has spent a lot
of money testing their cars, and like any professional sport, the
more money you spend, the better team you're going to be. Our
budget is probably 40 percent of their budget, which I would guess
is around $800,000 to $1 million per car.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not unhappy with our season. I never guessed we'd be
this successful. My goal was to be Rookie of the Year, but I didn't
realize I'd be third in points. It's been a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Neville, 26, and Thompson, 24, met while working at the Bob
Bondurant School of High Performance Driving, where they are
instructors when not racing.
</P>
<P>
   They share a similar goal, which, at present, is to remain in
Trans-Am. Down the road, however, Neville is eyeing a possible
NASCAR Winston Cup career, and Thompson hopes a NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series ride or one on the Championship Auto Racing Teams
circuit is awaiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't start racing until I got out of high school,''
Thompson said. ``I played mostly football and ran on the track
team. But I was always a racing fan. I used to ride a dirt bike all
the time. I thought one day I'd be the next Jeremy McGrath.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I took a course at the Bondurant school when I graduated
from Corona, and I really got the bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson spent a couple of seasons driving in a minor series,
then was forced to the sidelines when something happened that
plagues many racers. He ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't race for two years,'' Thompson lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson returned last season, driving a Camaro in a national
sedan series on the SCCA club level. In doing so, Thompson
impressed car owner Mike Lewis, who hired the Scottsdale driver to
drive a Ford Mustang Cobra this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, it was going well,'' Thompson said. ``Then we had
a string of five races that I wouldn't wish upon anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Neville, who moved to the Valley three years ago from Chicago,
didn't begin racing full time until he completed college at
Indiana-Purdue with a degree in communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents always wanted me to go to college, and I mostly did
it for them,'' Neville said. ``But I'm glad I did. College helped
me figure out how to put proposals together to find money from
potential sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized the best way to try and make it was to be an
instructor, and that's when I sent Bondurant a resume. I had done
some racing before that, and one of the guys I raced against was
Bill Cooper, who was Bondurant's chief instructor. That helped me
get my foot in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Neville spent several seasons in the SCCA World Challenge
circuit before he and car owner Jim Derhaag, a retired driver,
struck a deal this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim's got the second most starts ever in Trans-Am, and he was
looking to get back into the sport as a car owner,'' said Neville,
driver of the ARCO Chevy Camaro. ``I came up with a little bit of
sponsorship money and we got going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm trying to put together a program for another
year in Trans-Am. But I only want to do it if I can be a major
contender, which means more budget and test time. This year, I
don't consider myself a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that doesn't happen, I want to do as many stock car races
as possible. I have to look down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been contacted by some other (Trans-Am) teams, but
whatever I do, I need to stay with Ford because I've got close
allies with them,'' Thompson said. ``If things don't work out, I
wouldn't mind trying the (NASCAR) trucks or CART. I just need to
keep racing.'' &QL;

YOUNGER EARNHARDT GETS ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watch out, Jeff Gordon. Your future nemesis and budding rival
may be right around the next bend.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Earnhardt, but not that Earnhardt. Not the
seven-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion Earnhardt, the one with 71
career victories and enough trophies to fill a shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-uh.
</P>
<P>
   This Earnhardt is only 23 years old, has blondish hair and
doesn't yet know how to say no to questions or autograph requests.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Dale Earnhardt Jr., the nicest, humblest stock-car driver
this side of a parish priest.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Earnhardt jumped from nowhere into the NASCAR Busch
Series this season, and 21 races later, is in an excellent position
to capture the driving title as a rookie. Entering Sunday's race at
Michigan Speedway, Earnhardt has a series-high five wins (no one
else has more than two) and leads the standings by 48 points over
runner-up Matt Kenseth.
</P>
<P>
   Such early success might turn some sports celebrities into
instant Albert Belle-types. Not Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt doesn't appear to have an ornery bone or an arrogant
thought in his body, which he still drags to the race shop most
every day.
</P>
<P>
   And while so many trips into victory lane have produced numerous
sponsorship and other demands for his time, Earnhardt still hasn't
lost sight of what winning means most.
</P>
<P>
   And it has little, if nothing, to do with seeing his name in
headlines and on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know that (my racing) is all for my
daddy,'' Earnhardt said. ``When I win races, it puts a smile on his
face. I don't care much about anything else as far as the bonuses
that come along with winning . . . the money, the exposure, the
fame or whatnot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just to make him happy. It's what it's all about to
me. He's my daddy and I love him to death. And I want to do it for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Daddy should be proud.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the younger Earnhardt envisioned such a fast start to
his Busch career. But he refuses to believe he is ready to take the
next step, which would the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's humility is surpassed only by his obvious talents,
which haven't gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup car owner Bud Moore was around when NASCAR first
began 50 years ago, and many of his former drivers would fill a
who's who list of some of the sport's biggest names: drivers such
as Bobby Allison, David Pearson, Cale Yarborough, Buddy Baker, Joe
Weatherly and, uh, Dale Earnhardt Sr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell you, he's very stout,'' Moore said. ``He's
an up-and-coming driver, just like his daddy. He's determined to
make races, and he's got the ability to win races. I see no end to
him winning races.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. plans to honor his current contract, which
includes another season of Busch racing in 1999. Then, Earnhardt,
who drives his father's Busch car, is expected to move upward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely still a rookie,'' Earnhardt said. ``I have a
lot of polishing and molding to do on some of my skills. I have to
learn to be a lot more patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's learning curve also entails gaining experience off
the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea we were going to do this well,'' he said. ``But
we came out of the box running good and we've become a hot topic.
We've had to become somebody right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never met with sponsors before. I'd done some autograph
sessions, but nothing with like 3,000 race fans standing in line.
I've just always been a T-shirt-and-jeans guy. But I don't think
that's what cuts it anymore. I've got to clean up my act a little
bit, start shaving every day, things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big change, and I've had to learn a lot of things.
It's been overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't derailed Earnhardt, who has been compared to
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered to even be mentioned in the same sentence with
the man,'' Earnhardt said. ``He's doing an excellent job. But I'm
not one to boast about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for one day possibly challenging Gordon for NASCAR
superiority, Earnhardt welcomes the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might eat my words, but I think I'm ready for something like
that,'' Earnhardt said. ``I'd like to get in the mix with him and
just be competitive. Jeff Gordon is one of the best, if not ``the''

ELDERLY WOMEN TURN TABLES ON TORMENTORS, RESEARCH INDICATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 70-something woman had survived a long marriage of abuse.
She had been thrown through a storm door, suffering severe cuts.
She had been tossed into a wall, dislocating her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, the attacks had come.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was her turn. Her husband was in the next room, elderly,
helpless, pleading for his dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't going to feed him _ at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should he eat a decent meal when for 30 years I suffered
through every supper we ever had?'' she told a family friend as the
food grew cold.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime abuser was getting his payback, thought the younger
woman, now an Arizona elder-issues professional _ probably every
moment, every day, for as long as he would last.
</P>
<P>
   Tragic as they may be, such situations may be far more
widespread than previously thought, according to researchers
looking more carefully into the elder years of abusive marriages.
</P>
<P>
   As couples live longer, with women staying healthier than their
men, experts say instances of extended payback may be steadily
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   The state identified women as the perpetrators in 65 of 168
cases of elder spousal abuse from July 1996 through July 1997,
according to Adult Protective Service records.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of the cases involving elder men, abuse usually
took the form of neglect, although sometimes it was physical
violence.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure how much elder abuse exists. Only a small
fraction of elder-abuse cases are officially reported. Cases where
the man is being abused are thought to be reported even less often.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who witnessed the above scene didn't report the
incident and apologized for the actions of the older woman: ``This
was not a mean, vindictive woman, but a beaten-down person,'' she
explained, remembering her own years of pain as the victim of an
abusive husband.
</P>
<P>
   University of Arizona researcher Elaine Rousseau believes
payback situations aren't isolated. For years, Rousseau, an expert
on domestic abuse, has heard stories about long-abused wives who
turned the tables in old age. She is doing research to learn more
about what goes on behind the closed doors of older couples with
abuse histories.
</P>
<P>
   Elders generally don't talk about the subject, and their kids
and contemporaries often look the other way. Older men won't easily
admit being physically outmatched by a woman. Most physicians,
according to caseworkers, make excuses for not seeing the obvious,
and many are not prepared to speak candidly to victims and offer
program advice.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic abuse started coming into the public spotlight in the
1960s when people who are now in their 70s and 80s were
middle-aged. If they were in abusive situations, they kept it to
themselves and usually stayed married _ the ``shut up and put up''
generation. Only a small percentage of people over 65 are divorced.
</P>
<P>
   After telling her nurse practitioner students at the University
of Phoenix how to assess older women for signs of abuse, Jody
Pelusi asked them whether they should do the same for men.
</P>
<P>
   The room went quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think it occurs?'' Pelusi asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men wouldn't admit it if they were abused anyway,'' a student
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we should ignore it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   In her job as a nurse practitioner and cancer-outreach
coordinator for Maryvale Medical Center, she has seen an increasing
number of abused older men. Sometimes the abuse comes at the hands
of their grown children. When the abuser is the wife, it is more
likely to be emotional abuse or neglect, she observed.
</P>
<P>
   One case involved a prominent older couple in a rural Arizona
community. The husband had been a longtime drinker and the wife a
full-time homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   The wife continually complained that, from the early days of
their marriage, he verbally abused her. When he came down with a
chronic disabling condition, she grew more resentful because she
was housebound. She would neglect his needs, such as making him
wait a long time before helping him to the bathroom. She needed
outside help, but in a small community that was impossible:
``Everyone would know.'' OVERWHELMED SPOUSES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes abuse isn't ``payback'' but the result of a health
condition beyond the ability of a spouse to handle.
</P>
<P>
   A person with some forms of dementia can become violent, or the
abuser may not understand the changes in their spouse _ and lash
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very combative,'' said Scott Gardner, executive
director of the Phoenix Alzheimer's Association. ``There is a
tremendous risk for elderly abuse in early Alzheimer's.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two years Olle Steinwall's 71-year-old wife,
Constance, has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's, he has handled her
care on his own, managing to withstand the verbal abuse and
incontinence. Only recently, when she started striking him, did
Steinwall move his wife to a care facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife only weighs 125 pounds and is 5-foot-7,'' said
Steinwall, 72. ``You wouldn't think anyone who looks the way she
does has any strength, but she does.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of their 43 years of marriage the childless couple were
very close, Steinwall said. Only when Constance became physically
abusive did he seek out professionals at the Alzheimer's
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that I can't defend myself; I don't believe in
manhandling a woman,'' he said. ``I can't handle her anymore
without something happening to me or something happening to her.'' &QL; 
TWO-WAY ABUSE &QL; 
Some abusive elder households are two-way battles, with husband and
wife taking turns as abusers and victims.
</P>
<P>
   Most elder couples stay together, fighting to the end. One Adult
Protective Services case file includes an extended battle of
neglect and abuse where the untended husband lost a leg from
diabetes and suffered from heart disease. The wife, an alcoholic
and longtime victim of his physical abuse, joined him in horrific
verbal battles.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she wanted him out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly _ an ugly situation all around,'' Rousseau said.
</P>
<P>
   When the husband was put on a tranquilizer, however, the wife
decided to let him continue living at home.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of a year's cases from Adult Protective Services
that Rousseau is studying to see if patterns emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Another report describes a husband admitted to a hospital for
pneumonia who reported that his wife had physically abused him and
had for quite some time. He was unwilling to leave her, and did
return home. He said she had health problems and needed him. The
caseworker disagreed with his decision but had no power to stop
him, so long as he was legally competent.
</P>
<P>
   Most elderly abuse victims fear a nursing home or the street
more than they fear the conditions at home, according to case
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some abuse has gone on for so long that the elders have adjusted
over the years _ they may not realize they are being abused,
according to Rosalie Wolf, of Worcester, Mass., president and
founder of the National Committee for the Prevention of Elder
Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   They may be suffering from paralyzing depression, guilt, fear,
shame, alienation, feelings of helplessness, and even
post-traumatic stress syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if they do report it, where would they go?'' Wolf asked. &QL; 
CAUSE A GRAY AREA &QL; 
Alice Ghareib, domestic-violence specialist with the Maricopa
County Area Agency on Aging, believes that neglect is a dangerously
gray area and that each situation needs careful analysis: ``Is it
caregiver stress or is it really domestic violence? Is the
perpetrator's motive power and control over a partner?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau agrees, but believes that abuse is abuse, whatever the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau said older caregivers are allowed far more excuses than
younger people in justifying violence or negligence, she added.
</P>
<P>
   She and Rosalie Wolf say treatments that work for younger people
are not necessarily useful for elders. A support group for elderly
men in California was a flop. Many elderly people don't want to
move into shelters.
</P>
<P>
   If the chance of payback is there, it is even more important to
help older women who have been or are being abused.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Area Agency on Aging in Phoenix provides several resources
for elder victims of domestic abuse. Support groups for women over
50 have formed. Groups meet Tuesdays in the Sun City area and
Mondays in Mesa. About 60 women have gone through the groups. Many
of them have stayed in abusive relationships, but obtained new
coping skills and emotional support. In an emergency-housing
program that began a year ago, victims can stay up to two weeks in
any of 21 adult care and adult foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could do more outreach for men,'' Ghareib said. ``My
director said that if we could get just two men to come forward and
say they need help, I could start working on a program for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Elder men are a tough case.
</P>
<P>
   ``While more men may be abused, we still have a long way to go
to prove that is so,'' said Sue Beastall, a family therapist who
leads the local support groups for women. She points out that new
family-violence textbooks still report that 80 to 85 percent of
victims of abuse are women.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done if the traditional approaches to domestic abuse
don't quite work for elders?
</P>
<P>
   Wolf says counseling is helpful, especially if a person doesn't
want to leave the home. Reducing isolation is key: having someone
visit the home on a regular basis or taking advantage of adult
day-care programs can take some of the pressure out of a bad
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Rousseau's study on abused elderly couples is expected to be
completed next spring. &QL;

APACHES TO DEFY DEMAND FOR PRAYER PERMITS ON MT. GRAHAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of Arizona is requiring Native Americans to
obtain prayer permits before they cross the top of Mount Graham
near the university's $200 million telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   The university established the permits in an effort to
accommodate traditional-spiritual San Carlos Apaches and other
native peoples who hold sacred the high peaks of the Pinaleno
Mountains, 120 miles southeast of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Native American representatives say the permits are an attack on
their religious freedom, and they say they will not seek the
permits today when more than 80 Indians from across Arizona ascend
the 10,700-foot mountain, the nation's southernmost alpine forest
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Wendsler Noise, a San Carlos Apache, is organizing a 100-mile
run from his home on the reservation to near the top of the
mountain. Near the summit, Noise will lead 15 traditional-spiritual
Apaches to protest the university's telescopes, which they contend
interfere with their spiritual rites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I should have a permit. We are the original
inhabitants of this land. We are not going to vandalize their
telescopes. They know that for all these (hundreds) of years, the
Apaches have gone there to pray. I can't see why we need permits
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Noise was arrested last year for trespassing when he ventured
near the telescopes while he was praying for his 10-year-old
daughter's impending passage into womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   Noise, a former tribal council member who repeatedly voted to
oppose the telescopes, was acquitted in Graham County Superior
Court. After his acquittal, he said he hoped that the UA would
liberalize its visitation policies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the university came up with the prayer-permit policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some confusion about how you acquire permission to
come into the area,'' said Michael Cusanovich, UA vice president
for research and graduate studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a policy to make it clear to the public _ or in this
case, Indian people _ that if they want to come in, we encourage
that, but that we would make permits available to them,''
Cusanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not meant to be restrictive. It's meant to be
inclusive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the university never made a public announcement of the
prayer-permit policy, and few knew of its existence until last
month, when environmentalists obtained a copy of the policy through
a federal freedom of information request.
</P>
<P>
   The policy requires that permission be requested in writing, at
least two business days before a visit, and include a description
of where on the mountain the prayers will take place.
</P>
<P>
   The persons requesting the permit and all members of their party
must be enrolled members of a federally recognized tribe. In
addition, they must receive permission from the U.S. Forest Service
to enter the 1,600-acre refugium of the endangered Mount Graham red
squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Silver, conservation coordinator for the Southwest Center
for Biological Diversity, said the university's prayer policy is
not only offensive to Native Americans but shuts out everyone else
from visiting the high peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Silver contends that the telescope project would never have been
built if Congress had not passed specific exemptions to the
Endangered Species Act and other environmental laws in 1988 and _
when the project ran afoul of the laws again _ in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 7 letter to the Forest Service, the university said,
``The intent of this policy is to ensure that opportunities for
access remain for those Native Americans whose religious beliefs
call for worship on our site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, given the level of construction activity on the Large
Binocular Telescope site, we believe that a written policy is
essential to protect the safety of those visiting the . . . site as
well as to provide for security,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Cusanovich said the site has been plagued by ``monkeywrenching''
in the past, including nails scattered on roads, sugar poured in
gas tanks, locks glued shut and drain pipes stuffed to cause roads
to wash out.
</P>
<P>
   While no one has been caught, Cusanovich blames
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what these guys do for a living, as far as I can
tell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two smaller telescopes were dedicated on Mount Graham in 1993.
By the end of this year, the containment building for the Large
Binocular Telescope will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, electrical and other interior construction
and telescope mounts will be done. By the summer of 2000,
astronomers may be ready to install the first of two
33-foot-diameter mirrors, making it one of the world's largest and
most powerful optical astronomy instruments. &QL;

   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Lindsay Davenport won her 10th
consecutive match on the Corel WTA tour when she beat Natasha
Zvereva 6-2, 6-3, in 55 minutes on Friday night in the
quarterfinals of the Acura Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Davenport faces fourth-seeded Monica Seles
tonight at 7 in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva is Davenport's doubles partner and fellow Newport Beach
resident. The pairing presented a minor dilemma for Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult to play her,'' Davenport said. ``But on the
other hand, it was the quarterfinals of a big tournament and we
both were looking to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis' Nepal memories: When Martina Hingis visited Nepal in
late February to do charity work for the World Health Organization,
she learned something important, which she shared Friday. Expect
Hingis to continue to do charity work, but not in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have a lot of motivation to come home and practice
when you see that country,'' Hingis said. ``I will not go back
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario keying up: Third-seeded Aranxta Sanchez Vicario
advanced to the semifinals by beating Elena Tatarkova 6-3, 6-3.
Sanchez Vicario faces top-seeded Hingis today at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario says her main goal in the Acura Classic is to
prepare for the U.S. Open later this month. This tournament is her
first in two weeks. Any more of a hiatus for Sanchez would have
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to play as many tournaments as you can before the
Open,'' she said.

RANGERS FALL FROM AL WEST LEAD WITH 6-4 LOSS TO YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Right-hander Aaron Sele considered his pitching
performance worthy of victory.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the glove, Sele said, that failed him during the
Rangers' 6-4 loss to the New York Yankees last night at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' three-run seventh inning began with a ground ball
through the middle of the infield that resulted in the first of
five base hits and the Rangers' third consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Rangers will begin play today staring at a half-game
deficit in the American League West after the Anaheim Angels' 7-5
victory against the Blue Jays last night in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The three-run inning gave the Yankees what proved to be an
insurmountable five-run advantage. The Rangers, though, put a scare
into baseball's best with a late-innings rally that forced Yankees
manager Joe Torre to summon closer Mariano Rivera from the bullpen
in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case where I felt I threw the ball well enough to win a
game we needed to win,'' Sele said. ``If I field that ground ball,
we win the ballgame, 4-3. That's the way I look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who improved to 60 games over .500 for the first
time since their 1939 ballclub finished the season with a 106-45
record, removed most of the doubt of this outcome with their
seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (13-10) fooled left fielder Chad Curtis with a changeup,
yet Curtis' big swing fooled the pitcher. Sele expected the ball to
be hit harder, and the ground ball went through the infield for a
one-out single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be there and it wasn't,'' Sele said. ``You
watch the ball go by and you have no idea how you missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele answered the base hit with a strikeout of third baseman
Scott Brosius, but catcher Joe Girardi responded with the first of
three consecutive hits against the AL All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Chuck Knoblauch drove the first run home by
fighting off a 1-2 fastball in on his fists and dumping a bloop
single into shallow center field. The next two runs scored on a
two-strike single from shortstop Derek Jeter, and that ended Sele's
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Aaron threw the ball extremely well,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``I thought he pitched a lot like Rick
Helling did (Thursday) night. He kept us in the ballgame for 62/3
innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Yankees did most of their damage when Sele pitched
ahead in the count. Sele surrendered solo home runs to center
fielder Bernie Williams and Knoblauch on counts of 1-2 and 0-1,
respectively. The two run-scoring hits in the seventh inning were
on two-strike pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're playing the best team in baseball,'' said Sele, who
surrendered six runs on eight hits. ``They're not just going to
give in with two strikes and let you have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte, who surrendered a
fifth-inning solo home run to third baseman Todd Zeile, departed in
the eighth inning after consecutive singles by shortstop Royce
Clayton and second baseman Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored twice with a sacrifice fly from center
fielder Tom Goodwin and a run-scoring single by first baseman Will
Clark off right-hander Ramiro Mendoza. The latter forced Rivera
into the game, who induced an inning-ending ground ball from
catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Mike Simms crushed a ninth-inning slider from
Rivera to pull the Rangers within two runs, but the Yankees' closer
induced a game-ending, double-play ground ball from second baseman
Mark McLemore for his 32nd save.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps two seventh-inning singles _ neither hit well _ by
Curtis and Knoblauch separated the Rangers from their fifth loss in
six games this season to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to take anything away from them,'' Oates said.
``Look at the eighth inning: They smoked three balls and got
nothing out of it. They're doing what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and Sele did not.

SUTTON SEES NUMBER RETIRED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don Sutton, the winningest pitcher in Dodgers
history who was inducted in baseball's Hall of Fame on July 26, had
his No.20 retired by the club during pregame ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who recorded 233 of his 324 career victories with the
Los Angeles Dodgers, became the 10th player to have his number
retired by the club. He also had his likeness unveiled on the
outfield wall near the right-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the appearance of Dodgers greats Pee Wee Reese and
Sandy Koufax and his first big-league pitching coach, Red Adams,
that forced Sutton to fight back tears during his acceptance
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to win 300 and I hoped to make the Hall of Fame,
but I never planned for this,'' said Sutton, now an Atlanta Braves
broadcaster. ``I never really thought about having my number up
there. Those guys are legends in Dodger history. It's a very
emotional night, and it's going to take a while to recover from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton pitched with the Dodgers from 1966-80 and returned
briefly in 1988. He also pitched with Houston, Milwaukee, Oakland
and the Angels. Last Monday marked the 10th anniversary of the last
day of his 23-year career. He was released by the Dodgers to make
room for a promising right-hander, Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield out, Mondesi in: Gary Sheffield, who ended an 0-for-18
slump Thursday night, was sidelined Friday with a sprained right
thumb. Sheffield injured his thumb sliding into third base on a
stolen base in the third inning. Last season, Sheffield was placed
on the 15-day disabled list with an injury to his left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi returned to the lineup Friday after fouling a pitch off
his left ankle Thursday night. Mondesi was removed from the final
game of the Florida series in the fifth inning and taken to
Centinela Hospital Medical Center for precautionary x-rays, which
were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Batting practice was canceled Friday because of the Sutton
retirement ceremony, so Sheffield and Mondesi did not arrive at
Dodger Stadium until 5:30 p.m. ``We didn't know until then who
could play and who couldn't,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``I made
out four different lineups today.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Carl Pease, mayor of Vero Beach, Fla., the Dodgers'
spring training site for the past 50 years, was a guest of former
club president Peter O'Malley at Friday's game. There is fear in
Vero Beach that, with the new ownership, the Dodgers will move
their training camp to Arizona, closer to their fan base.

FOR THIRD STRAIGHT GAME, M'S BLOWN OUT IN BIG INNING

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Another disastrous inning Friday night kept the
Mariners' once-promising road trip spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Six runs in an inning one night. Seven the next day. And then
nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we give 'em up, we really give 'em up, don't we?''
manager Lou Piniella said after the Chicago White Sox turned a
pitching duel between starters Ken Cloude and Mike Sirotko into a
14-2 rout before 22,713 fans at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Only the inning changed.
</P>
<P>
   After being hammered in the seventh inning twice in Toronto, the
Mariners were bludgeoned by a nine-run sixth inning Friday _ the
most runs they have allowed in an inning this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three bad innings in three different games,'' said Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   The M's started this nine-game road trip with four straight wins
in Detroit. They have lost the past three and trail first-place
Anaheim by 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a time for scoreboard watching. Unless you are Jerry
Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watch the scoreboard,'' the White Sox manager said. ``Not
in the sense that we can catch anyone. We watch to see how many
runs we score.''
</P>
<P>
   A whole bunch Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sox designated hitter Frank Thomas singled and doubled, hit his
20th home run and drove in three runs. Albert Belle hit the 300th
and 301st doubles of his career and drove in four runs. And Robin
Ventura capped the 16-hit barrage off the suddenly
once-again-hittable Mariner pitching staff with a solo homer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ken Griffey Jr. emerged from an August slump with three
hits, a misplay by fellow All-Star Alex Rodriguez provided an
opening in the sixth inning that the entire White Sox lineup
charged through.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude, trailing 2-1 when the sixth began, seemingly had kept
the inning in relative check before the onslaught. The right-hander
had surrendered two runs and there were runners on first and third
when Magglio Ordonez hit a grounder to Rodriguez's left.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mariner shortstop got to the ball, which routinely would
have been an inning-ending double play, it skidded off his glove
for an error, and Cloude never recorded another out.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner reliever Bob Wells fared even worse, allowing three hits
and four runs, including Thomas' towering homer to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have ended the inning,'' Cloude said of the grounder
by Ordonez, ``but the ball hit the lip (of the grass) and stayed
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude tried not to get too down after his eighth loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to tip your cap to the hitters,'' he said.
``They put the ball in play, and it just goes to show what can
happen. The key is keeping the little guys off base and limiting
the damage Thomas and Belle can do to you.''
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't keep the little guys off base.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham, the leadoff batter, went 4-for-5. Mike Caruso, the
No. 2 hitter, reached base four times and scored four runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some good pitches, but some bad ones, too,'' Cloude
said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the bad ones occurred in the decisive sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken was sailing along pretty well,'' Piniella said. ``When
he's had difficulty this year, he's not been able to work himself
out of the middle part of the ballgame. Same thing (Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka, who improved to 12-10 with his fourth win in his past
five decisions, mastered the Mariners by mostly staying on the
outside part of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert's on fire, and we're much better defensively,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid threw strikes and got ahead of the hitters,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's second hit of the game helped produce Seattle's first
run. The Mariner center fielder stole second, his 16th theft of the
season, and scored on Edgar Martinez's single. That pulled the M's
even at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior swung the bat much better, and that's good to see,''
said Piniella of Griffey, who had been 8-for-41 this month. ``Now,
we have to get David (Segui) going.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui, one of the American League's batting average leaders
before injuring his right knee in a freak accident in Detroit, is
1-for-11 since returning to the lineup after missing four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days off haven't helped him,'' Piniella said. ``He lost
his rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the off-days (Monday and Thursday) helped us,''
the manager added. ``Let's see if we can get get into a rhythm and
start playing better.''
</P>
<P>
   And most of all, stop surrendering big innings.

SEAHAWKS SEEK QUICK STOP, TEAM LEADER IN NO. 1 DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Michael Sinclair was not smiling, and that is
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear the Pro Bowl defensive end has ample reason to
beam. After all, the subject on the eve of Saturday night's
American Bowl game against the San Francisco 49ers was how well the
Seahawks' No. 1 defensive unit has played in the team's first two
preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 series against the Dallas Cowboys and Indianapolis Colts,
Sinclair and his fellow Seahaw starters have forced six
three-and-outs, come up with two turnovers and squelched another
drive by batting down a pass as time expired in the first half.
They have allowed two touchdowns and a field goal, but each was the
result of, or set up by, a mental mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like that will allow a defense to rank among the NFL's
top 10, as the Seahawks did last year. Efforts like that also will
allow the Seahawks to win a lot of games, which they haven't done
since going 10-6 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But something is missing, and it's not just Sinclair's trademark
Chesire-cat grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you can say we've played pretty well, but we've got to
kill that first series,'' Sinclair said. ``We can't let it be a
wake-up call and then go three-and-out maybe six or seven times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opener at Dallas two weeks ago, the Seahawks allowed the
Cowboys to move to the 40-yard line before forcing a punt. Worse
yet _ much worse _ cornerback Shawn Springs blew a coverage in last
week's game against Indianapolis that resulted in a 48-yard TD pass
on the Colts' opening possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first drive, we have to stop that like right now,''
Sinclair said. ``That sets the tempo for the game. So stopping that
first drive has to become our signature.''
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, that has been as difficult to do as trying
to decipher why the Seahawk defense has yet to become as dominant
on the field as it appears on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Allen has an idea, and who knows the Seahawks' defense
any better? With the possible exception of John Elway, no player
has been as productive over the years against the Seahawks as
Allen. He hurt them running, receiving and even passing in 16
seasons with the Los Angeles Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, they've been sort of an enigma,'' Allen, now a CBS
studio analyst for NFL games, said Friday. ``At least of late,
they've always had excellent talent, but it just hasn't come
together completely for this team like a lot of people envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder why some teams have so much success against them. I
was always sort of perplexed by that,'' he said. ``Maybe it's a
lack of leadership. Not from the coaches, but the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen wasn't trying to be critical, just analytical.
</P>
<P>
   When Allen broke into the league in 1982, Kenny Easley was just
hitting his stride while hitting anything and everything in his
stride as Seattle's strong safety. Easley was driven and the
driving force behind a defense that did more with less than the
Seahawks have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always sort of puzzled me why, as talented as they are,
they have not come together,'' Allen said. ``I don't mean to slight
anybody, but who's the leader of this defense?''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Allen quizzed a couple of players as they
left the field at B.C. Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose team is this?'' he asked Pro Bowl free safety Darryl
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren Moon's, I guess,'' was Williams' less-than-convincing
answer. Besides, Moon plays offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose team is this?'' Allen then asked linebacker Chad Brown,
the team's leading tackler last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we're still waiting to determine,'' Brown
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Allen didn't have to offer an I-told-you-so. The sly smile on
his face showed he had proved his point.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to one of the Seahawk defenders to prove him wrong.

RED SOX CELEBRATE AFTER BASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox and Twins returned to bountiful Friday night,
turning Updike's lyric little bandbox in the Back Bay into the big
league version of a roadside batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   Drop a dollar's worth of quarters into the machine, cock bat,
swing for downtown, and keep swinging until someone turns out the
lights.
</P>
<P>
   When the quarters finally ran out at Fenway Park, it was the Sox
who were left standing, their bats red hot in a wild 13-12 triumph
that was decided on Donnie Sadler's two-run single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest-working guy out there,'' said Sox manager Jimy
Williams, who had seen his club outlast the Twins, 8-7, the
previous night, ``was the guy changing the numbers on the
scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   If it gets any busier when the clubs meet tonight at the Fens,
Vanna White will have to be summoned to work the big board.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, who went 3 for 4 with three RBIs, drove home Troy
O'Leary and Jason Varitek to give the Sox a 13-11 lead in the
seventh, and they hung on for their 71st win of the season. The
wild 'n' crazy Sox moved 23 games over .500.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 32,888 (No. 25 this season) saw hometown
starter Tim Wakefield fall into a 6-0 deficit in the third, a lead
that was erased in the bottom of the inning when the Sox sent 10
hitters to the plate and scored a half-dozen runs on six hits,
capped by Mike Stanley's two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of 3 hours 28 minutes, the Sox lost leads of 8-6
and 9-8. They moved in front, 11-9, in the bottom of the fifth on
Damon Buford's two-run triple, but the Twins tied it again, 11-11,
in the seventh on a two-run double by Paul Molitor. For yet another
night in the Fens, the ups and downs resembled the recent whipsaw
moves of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
</P>
<P>
   Get the idea out there in Red Sox Nation? If the Townies do make
it to the national stage in October, the viewing audience will be
warned not to watch the broadcast without donning catcher's mask
and chest protector.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the ninth, left in the hands of Sox reliever Tom
Gordon, mimicked much of the night. Pat Meares led off with a walk,
moved to second on Molitor's one-out single to right, and took
third when Matt Lawton drew a pass on four pitches. Marty Cordova
chopped a grounder to first, easily scooped by Mo Vaughn for a soft
toss to Gordon covering the bag. But Gordon missed the touch with
his right foot, Cordova was safe, and Meares skipped home with the
12th Minnesota run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost it _ I thought it was a popup,'' said Gordon, who hung
on for his 31st consecutive save, the longest current streak in the
bigs, and 34th of the season. ``That's why I reacted late and
missed the bag. Well, I might have just touched it with the side of
my foot, but if I did, there was no way to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Gordon two grounders, and perhaps the tiniest skip of a
heartbeat, to end it. First, Todd Walker hit a grounder to third
that John Valentin scooped and fired home in time to erase Molitor.
Bases still loaded. Ron Coomer, who hours before socked a homer off
the gargantuan Coke bottles, then drilled one to third. Valentin
made a quick scoop of the shot _ a sure two-run single if it got
through _ and ended the evening by stepping on third base for the
force on Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what he gets paid for; he should make those,'' kidded
Gordon. ``Really, that was a beautiful play. He hit that pretty
hard. I left it out over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   In two nights, the clubs have combined for 38 runs. They
combined for 32 hits Friday night, with every starter on each side
contributing at least one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was still early in the game,'' said Stanley, thinking back
to when the Sox were looking at the 6-0 deficit. ``It was one of
those things where we said, `OK, just start pecking away.' And it
gave us a chance to be in the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Game time Sunday: 5 p.m. Bring lots of quarters and an extra
eraser if you plan to keep score.

METS BEAT DIAMONDBACKS, 3-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Last season, Rick Reed, a baseball journeyman,
surprised everyone by winning 13 games for the Mets. Friday night
he went one better, winning his 14th game of this season, and he
demonstrated again that he has turned into one of the National
League's best pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   In pitching seven strong innings in a 3-2 victory over the
Arizona Diamondbacks, Reed allowed just eight hits to move to 14-7
this season, his 12th and best as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not his best performance,'' Mets Manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``I thought he got away with a lot of pitches up
tonight. But it was good enough. I'm not complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed (14-7) needed a little help from Dennis Cook, who pitched a
scoreless eighth, and Turk Wendell, who closed out the ninth for
his first save of the season, to surpass his season high.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell walked the first two batters he faced in the ninth, but
the next two batters _ pinch-hitters Andy Stankiewicz and Hanley
Frias _ hit grounders to short, one that Rey Ordonez was not able
to turn into a double play, another that he was.
</P>
<P>
   And, with their victory over the expansion Diamondbacks, the
Mets (65-54) were able to keep pace with the Chicago Cubs in the
National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Mets' 17th in their last 25 games, as they
pulled a season-high 11 games over .500 for the fifth time this
year. Because Chicago won in Houston Friday evening, the Mets still
trail the Cubs by one-half game in the post-season chase.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, a first-time All-Star selection this season, struck out
five and did not walk a batter to lower his walk per nine inning
average to 1.2, tying him with Atlanta's Greg Maddux for the
stingiest ratio in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   A career 22-24 pitcher coming into this season, Reed's best
season was 1997, when he went 13-9 with a 2.89 earned run average
for the Mets. Reed, starting his 24th game of the year Friday
night, was coming off one of the worst performances of his career.
</P>
<P>
   One week earlier in Denver, Reed had allowed 12 hits and 7 runs
_ both tying his career highs _ in an 8-7 victory over the Colorado
Rockies. Reed nearly squandered a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, in the Mets' first game at Bank One Ballpark,
Reed fell behind early. He allowed a one-out single in the second
to Karim Garcia, who took third on a long Jay Bell fly to left and
then scored on a Tony Batista single for a 1-0 Arizona lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored in the top of the fourth off the Arizona
right-hander Amaury Telemaco. John Olerud, the league's batting
leader when the day began, opened the inning by lining a single to
center for his second hit of the game. One out later, Brian McRae
drove a full-count offering over the fence in left-center field.
The home run was McRae's 18th of the season, a career high, putting
the Mets ahead by 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The lead did not last the inning, however. Garcia belted a
one-out home run into the pool area beyond the fence in
right-center field to tie the score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied again in the fifth, as Ordonez singled to
left-center to open the inning. Reed sacrificed Ordonez to second,
and Ordonez moved to third on a Telemaco wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco went to 2-2 on Tony Phillips before Phillips grounded a
run-scoring single just wide of Travis Lee at first base for a 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then the managing began. After Todd Hundley struck out for the
second time in three at-bats to end the Mets' sixth, Valentine
switched Phillips from right to left, moved Lenny Harris from third
to right and inserted Edgardo Alfonzo into the game at third.
</P>
<P>
   The moves saved the Mets a run in the bottom of the seventh.
With Reed still clinging to the one-run lead, Batista singled to
left with one out. Damian Miller followed with a single to right.
As Harris charged the ball, Batista decided to test the new right
fielder's arm.
</P>
<P>
   Harris delivered a perfect one-hop throw to Alfonzo at third to
nail Batista for the second out, as Miller took second on the
throw. But Reed was not out of danger. The 32-year-old right-hander
hit pinch-hitter David Dellucci with a pitch to put runners on
first and second. But after the former Yankee Andy Fox nearly hit a
first-pitch, three-run home run that went just foul down the right
field line, Fox popped up to second to leave Reed two innings away
from his 14th victory with a lead the bullpen was called on to
protect.

RENEGADES, WINGS GAIN WLEAGUE FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUPEN FOFARIA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAMINGHAM _ It's too bad the Boston Renegades weren't playing
pinball Friday night. Given all the shots that went off players'
bodies and the four that hit the top bar of the goal box, they
could have had the game easily in hand before the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, they were playing soccer in the W-League semifinals at
Bowditch Field, and bouncing balls were worth nothing. So the hosts
had to start using their heads _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Connors scored twice in the second half and Boston
defeated the New Jersey Stallions, 2-0, before a crowd of 1,361.
That sends the Renegades into Sunday's final against the undefeated
Raleigh Wings, who beat the Maryland Pride, 5-0, in the first
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we played well, especially in the second half, you
know, once everybody got over the nerves in the first half and
settled down and started playing,'' said team captain Amy
Heseltine. ``And what Rick (Copland, the coach) told us before the
game was get the ball to flanks and serve it far post or back post,
and that's how we won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After a sluggish first half, the Renegades got going seven
minutes into the second as Laura Collins orchestrated a brilliant
drive down the left side. She crossed over the box and lobbed a
quick pass to Connors, who hadn't practiced with the team for a
week because of a hip flexor that she was still treating during
halftime. Connors headed the ball over a charging Amy Pseja in the
Stallion goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the back post wide open,'' said Connors, who was lifted
with 30 minutes left so she could rest her hip. ``None of the
defenders saw me running behind there, and Laura played a perfect
ball right to my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven minutes later, with the crowd still buzzing, Connors saw
the ball pop out near the goal and secured it about 8 yards from
Pseja. With a defender approaching on her right, she cocked her
left foot and blasted one, top shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was easy,'' she said. ``I saw the far post open, so I
fired it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stallions didn't have such an easy time. Not only did they
face a solid performance by Renegade keeper Jen Mead, but they
plain ran out of gas trying to keep up with Connors and find
quality shots. Mead came up with two saves, both with a charging
Stallion inside the box.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings, unbeaten in 15 games this season, are the heavy
favorites to claim the title.
</P>
<P>
   But Renegade players and coaches said they aren't worried or
intimidated by Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be fun,'' said Connors, flashing a smile.

</P>
<P>
   Winning streak &QL; 
ends at 7 games
</P>
<P>
   Cubs pitcher's single costs Reynolds
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Strategically, Astros manager Larry Dierker thought it was the
right move to make:
</P>
<P>
   Take a chance and pitch to No. 8 hitter Jeff Blauser, who was
batting .450 lifetime against Astros starter Shane Reynolds and had
homered an inning earlier?
</P>
<P>
   Or order an intentional walk with first and third base occupied,
load the bases and gamble with light-hitting pitcher Mark Clark?
</P>
<P>
   One decision. One wrong decision, it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Clark hit a two-run single off Reynolds with two out in the
sixth inning that broke open a two-run game as the Chicago Cubs
snapped the Astros' seven-game winning streak with a 6-4 victory
before a crowd of 45,040 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was certainly the most unorthodox thing I've ever done
since I've had this job,'' said Dierker, whose club lost for only
the fourth time in its last 18 games. ``I think in almost every
situation it's a bad strategy to walk somebody and force a runner
into scoring position. That's not something I would believe that I
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet I thought we had a pretty good chance to have it work. It
was a very strange situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Blauser, who sent a 2-1 fastball from Reynolds over the
left-field fence in the fifth inning, had not been intentionally
walked in 330 at-bats this season. Clark was 1-for-45 (.022) before
his bloop single to center capped the Cubs' four-run sixth and put
the Astros in a 5-1 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy is 1-for-45 and the other guy (Blauser) up there is
a nemesis for your pitcher, it seemed like the one time you might
do it,'' said Dierker, who this season has called for only 17
intentional walks, tied for second-fewest in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Cubs' four-run sixth, the Astros toyed with a
possible 39th come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou hit his 33rd home run _ a two-run shot off Clark and
one of three Astros homers. Alou's blast made it 6-4 in the eighth,
and the Astros had runners at first and second in the ninth before
Cubs closer Rod Beck slammed the door for his 35th save.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, second in the home-run chase behind St. Louis' Mark
McGwire, was kept in the ballpark to remain at 46 homers. He found
other ways to beat the Astros, going 3-for-5 with an RBI and
scoring twice.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping Milwaukee out of the NL Central chase with a
four-game sweep, the Astros were looking to deal a similar blow to
the Cubs. It appeared that might happen when Reynolds (14-8) got
eight strikeouts and allowed only one run through five innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Morandini led off the sixth with a single, and Sosa
doubled to right-center to drive in the go-ahead run. Mark Grace
singled, and two batters later Jose Hernandez hit a run-scoring
single. Then came the intentional pass to Blauser and Clark's
two-run bloop into center.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Reynolds) looked like he was in total command of the game
when all of a sudden it's really sort of mysterious how fast it can
leave you,'' Dierker said. ``He just couldn't recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds ended with nine strikeouts in 5 innings but came up
short for the second time against the Cubs. He had 10 strikeouts in
a 2-0 loss May 6, when the Astros struck out 20 times and managed
just one infield single against Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of pitches in that inning I missed my
spots and got hurt,'' said Reynolds, who had won eight of his
previous 10 decisions. ``That was pretty much the game. If you miss
some pitches against these guys, it will cost you the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs manager Jim Riggleman defended Dierker's decision to walk
Blauser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a pretty good move,'' Riggleman said. ``He
knew Blauser is starting to come up (offensively) a little bit. It
took a lot of guts to make a move like that, but I thought it was
the right move.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago added another run in the seventh on an RBI single by
Grace off reliever Trever Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Clark (7-11) allowed four runs (three home runs) and struck out
eight in 7 innings. He is 4-1 with a 3.15 ERA lifetime against the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Berry gave the Astros a 1-0 lead in the third with his
third home run on the Astros' current homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell added a solo shot in the fifth, and Alou's two-run
blast pulled the Astros within two. Alou, who has homered in five
of the last eight games, is tied for fifth on the Astros'
single-season home-run list with 33.
</P>
<P>
   None of that power mattered Friday, though, when the game came
down to one decision and least likely of hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Was it the biggest hit of Clark's career?
</P>
<P>
   `` Yeah, I guess,'' Clark said after a long pause. ``Let's just
say I picked a real good time to get my second hit of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Dierker to guess wrong.

VAUGHN WON'T BAR DUQUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn and Dan Duquette engaged in what appeared to be a
congenial conversation following Red Sox batting practice Friday
night at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Definition of congenial: The first baseman did not wrap the
general manager in a headlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no reason to have Dan Duquette in a headlock,'' said
Vaughn moments after the talk with his boss came to an uneventful
and peaceful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   And, contrary to a report on Channel 4 Thursday night, Vaughn
said he remained open to having Duquette stay a part of the
negotiations _ provided they resume _ aimed at getting the All-Star
slugger signed to a long-term Boston deal.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 4's Bob Lobel, speaking last night from his car phone,
said his report Thursday made it clear, based on a conversation
with Vaughn, that the first baseman feels Duquette will be out of
the negotiating loop if a deal is struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's being fair to Mo, to put it that way,'' said Lobel.
``What he said was, `If it's going to get done, then John
Harrington's going to be the one to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the implication to Lobel was that Vaughn wouldn't be
run out of town by anyone less than Harrington, the club's chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the report,'' said Vaughn. ``Anybody can be
involved, you know. It doesn't matter to me. (Duquette is) going to
be the general manager and he's going to do what he's got to do.
It's not about who's involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he would not respond to the Channel 4 story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't comment on gossip presented last night,'' he said.
The GM went on to note, ``If you remember, I signed Mo to his last
contract and I made the (recent) offers in good faith for him to
stay in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Vaughn, the conversation with Duquette last night
pertained to a photograph, the nature of which he didn't discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn sounded as if he has taken an all-business approach to
his stalled negotiations, which haven't resumed since he turned
down Boston's four-year offer worth $37 million last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say, `I can't talk to you,''' said Vaughn.
``Business is business.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating, said Vaughn, is not about personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing else to talk about,'' he said. ``It's like a
fax machine. Stick the numbers in and that's it. It doesn't matter
what desk it comes from ... Dan Duquette ... John Harrington ... it
doesn't matter. All the personal feelings are gone. Personal
feelings have nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a deal with the Sox could get done, Vaughn said,
``There's always time. There's always time.''

JAGUARS BEAT GIANTS, 24-10  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE _ For the third time in three meetings, the
Jacksonville Jaguars brought out the worst in the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in the preseason a year ago and in the 1997 regular
season, the Jaguars made the Giants look confused and unprepared in
a lopsided 24-10 defeat Friday night at Alltel Stadium. In three
games during the last two seasons, Jacksonville has outscored the
Giants by 104-39.
</P>
<P>
   On offense Friday night, the Giants stumbled badly, picking up
just six first downs and failing to convert a first down on 12 of
13 third-down attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The starting quarterback, Danny Kanell, failed to complete his
first seven passes during a sloppy, penalty-filled first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' vaunted defense fared no better. The tackling was
careless and shoddy, and the defense was called for six first-half
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Giants were thoroughly dominated and looked flat,
something that has happened recently whenever the opponent is
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was flashback for me from our game with them last year,''
Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ``It's like we've reverted to last
year at this time. I'm not very happy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who eased to a 24-17 victory over the Cincinnati
Bengals last weekend, can now expect a week of harsh practices from
Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   The coach raged at his team when it played with similar
indifference last preseason against Jacksonville. He did not look
favorably Friday night on an offense that was out of sync and a
defense that put forth an inattentive effort.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell played the first half, finishing the game with 2
completions in 9 attempts for 47 yards. The Giants' rushing attack
was nearly as ineffective. Tiki Barber dropped another wide-open
pass _ as he did last week _ and ran 3 times for 11 yards. His
replacement, Tyrone Wheatley, came up with only 21 yards on 8
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Of Kanell's performance, Fassel pointed out that his quarterback
was given little time to throw because of poor protection from the
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the quarterback takes five steps into the pocket and
there's five guys on him, there's not much he can do,'' Fassel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel also criticized Barber. ``I'm worried about Tiki right
now,'' he said. ``He's not showing me he can catch the ball in
games or in practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants kept the game close in the second half when both
teams played their second- and third-string units. A bizarre
touchdown scored by Giants receiver Amani Toomer cut the
Jacksonville lead to 17-10 with six seconds remaining in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Toomer dived to the grass to make a shoestring catch on the
Giants' 37-yard line. As defensive back Kevin Devine passed Toomer,
he appeared to reach out to touch him down.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials ruled that no contact was made, no whistle
blew, and Toomer leaped to his feet and dashed into the end zone
untouched for a 73-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   But a touchdown pass from Jacksonville's third-string
quarterback Jonathan Quinn to Alvis Whitted restored the Jaguars'
two-touchdown lead.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the second half, Jacksonville scored on a 59-yard
touchdown run by Tavian Banks, a reserve running back.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, quarterback Mark Brunell led the Jaguars on
an 8-play, 73-yard drive culminating with a 5-yard touchdown pass
to Jimmy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In the early going Friday night, the Giants looked sloppy. There
were penalties on both sides of the ball, two low snaps on Giants
punts and more missed Giants tackles in the first quarter than one
would normally have been seen in two Giants games last season.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the ease Kanell showed at the helm in last week's
game seemed a distant memory against the aggressive Jacksonville
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell missed Chris Calloway with his first pass of the evening,
badly overthrowing his receiver. Kanell would follow that up with
six successive incomplete passes.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did not mount a scoring drive _ and Kanell did not
complete a pass _ until midway through the second quarter when
Jacksonville had removed most of its starting defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants moved into Jacksonville territory following a 31-yard
pass down the right sideline from Kanell to Ike Hilliard. It was
Kanell's first completion. But Kanell hit tight end Andy Haase for
a 16-yard gain on the next play, bringing the Giants to the
Jacksonville 18-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' drive stalled there, with place-kicker Brad Daluiso
converting on a 35-yard field goal, his first of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn returned a deflected pass 30
yards for an apparent touchdown in the second quarter, a score that
was nullified when the Giants' Phillippi Sparks was called for
holding Jacksonville wide receiver Reggie Barlow.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a variety of penalties called against the Giants'
defense on pass plays in the first half. Percy Ellsworth and Jessie
Armstead also drew penalties, and Sparks had an unnecessary
roughness penalty at the end of a play.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars' first-half lead was just 10-3, in part because
Jacksonville place-kicker Mike Hollis missed two first-half field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Just before intermission, Hollis was successful on a field-goal
attempt from 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled 8 p.m. start of the game was delayed for an hour
because of thunderstorms and lightning in the Jacksonville area.
But an hour later, it had become another clear, humid Florida
night. The game was played in otherwise dry conditions.

Singh feasts on baked 
Sahalee, copies record
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
REDMOND, Wash. _ Sahalee Country Club put its toughest face forward
Friday at the 1998 PGA Championship, and while the names at the top
of the leader board changed, the leading number did not.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh was the man holding the top score of 4-under-par 136
following the first two rounds. Singh's 66 matched the course
record set by Tiger Woods on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie (67), Steve Stricker (68) and Scott Gump (69)
were one shot back at 137, followed by a group of five golfers at
2-under 138 that included Woods (72), Houston's Steve Elkington
(69), defending champion Davis Love III (68), Brad Faxon (68) and
Andrew Magee (68).
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five players survived the cut at Sahalee, which was set
at 5-over-par 145. Among those heading home for the weekend were
Justin Leonard (147), Lee Westwood (150) and U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen (148).
</P>
<P>
   There has been no rain in the Seattle area for days, and the
Sahalee tract reflected that Friday. The fairways were hard and
quick, and by the end of the second round, the baked greens were
fast and finicky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens got Sunday-afternoon-major hard,'' Faxon said.
``They got very crusty and dry. In the fairways, the ball was
rolling and rolling. So if you didn't hit it in the fairway, you
had a hard time making par. If you didn't hit it toward the middle
of the green, you were in trouble. It was what it's supposed to be
for a PGA.''
</P>
<P>
   And about two to three shots tougher than it was Thursday, by
Mark O'Meara's standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fairways were much firmer, much, much faster,'' said
O'Meara, who is still in the running for his third major victory of
the year. ``You could throw it in there at the greens the first
day. Today, I hit a nice little 7-iron into the last hole that hit
10 feet short of pin-high and went 25 feet past the hole. The golf
course is firming up, and the scores are going to reflect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh got a break because he had an early tee time, when the
course was at its easiest, and he took advantage of his
opportunities. Singh came out on fire, with five front-nine
birdies. He missed makable par putts twice on the back side but
hung on to match the course record with his 66.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key was the start of my round,'' Singh said.
``That gave me confidence. And I'm hitting the ball really good,
too. I hit a lot more greens today than I did yesterday, and
obviously I putted a lot better. You've got to putt well on greens
like this. In the morning, the greens were a little bit softer and
you could actually hold the balls on the greens. But it's getting
hard and fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who finished under par Friday was more than pleased,
including Woods, who had his share of problems but was willing to
take his 72 and move on. Woods had trouble off the tee for much of
the day and had to rely on his iron play to keep him in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those rounds where I didn't hit the ball
particularly well,'' he said. ``I didn't give myself a lot of
chances for birdie. But I hung in there, and my short game was
great today. A lot of good saves. I'm not happy with the way I hit
the ball. But I'm pleased and ecstatic with the way I scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, who is trying to defend his PGA Championship title, also
left Sahalee on Friday evening a happy man. Love had one of the
latest tee times of those on the leader board, so his 68 was
especially satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only two strokes' difference from yesterday, but it's a
world of difference in the way I played,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker was the one player late in the day who had a good
opportunity to take the lead from Singh. Stricker got his momentum
going on the back side, making birdie on four of the first seven
holes on the back nine and taking sole possession of the lead on
No. 16 at 5 under par. But the advantage was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-3 17th, Stricker put his tee shot into the water and
ended up making double bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``My caddie and I couldn't really pinpoint the wind direction,
and it was swirling all day long,'' Stricker said. ``But I went
with a 5-iron and I tried to hit it fairly hard, and I didn't catch
it solid at all, and as soon as I hit it, I had a pretty good idea
it was going to come up short into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions at Sahalee aren't likely to get easier for the final
two rounds. It is supposed to get cooler, but there is no rain in
the forecast, and unless the PGA dumped lot of water on the
fairways and greens overnight, hard and fast would be the rule, not
the exception.
</P>
<P>
   That was welcome news to all those players within striking
distance of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only two back, and that's perfect,'' Woods said. ``That's
where I really need to be. If they don't put a lot of water on the
course, it's still going to be very firm and very fast. It's going
to be very difficult to shoot a low number.''

   Great expectations &QL; 
fuel second guesses
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT was that time of the evening when during most Astros seasons _
say, 1962 through 1996, minus a couple of banner-hanging years _
much of the crowd would have turned its back on the game and headed
for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Down two runs. Nothing going right. The bottom three in the
lineup due up.
</P>
<P>
   But these are Larry Dierker's magnificent Astros. These are the
guys who have come from behind 38 times this season and have looked
as if they could take out the '27 Yankees. Or, better yet, the '98
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   When Sean Berry, Tony Eusebio and pinch hitter Dave Clark
reached for the lumber going into the bottom of the ninth, you got
the feeling the Astros again would find a way. There would be a
final-inning home run, a bases-loaded double, to send it to extra
innings _ anything to give us something to marvel about Monday at
the office.
</P>
<P>
   You weren't the only one who thought it. The 45,040 fans at the
Astrodome believed, standing and cheering as if this was the day
everyone would go home with a Beanie Baby.
</P>
<P>
   Astros do all the right things
</P>
<P>
   Dierker thought it, anxiously shuffling around the dugout during
the final at-bat, wondering which of his players would be a hero
this time around. Cubs manager Jim Riggleman thought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but notice that they have won a lot that way
all year,'' Riggleman said. ``It almost had an atmosphere of `We'll
come back and win this.'''
</P>
<P>
   But alas, the Astros didn't. The Cubs made all the plays,
including the unlikely ones, in a 6-4 win that reminded everyone
that no matter how many giveaways are scheduled for this weekend _
mouse pads, umbrellas, Beanie Babies _ every night remains Pennant
Night until the Astros can put away Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're eight games up _ we're going to have to beat the Cubs a
few times,'' Dierker said, explaining the NL Central race that
could become just that by the end of this three-game set if the
Cubs stay hot. ``We probably don't have to beat them as often as
they have to beat us, but we do have to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will. This team is better than Chicago in every way,
if not better than all of the National League. They are Dierker's
magnificent Astros.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night's loss shed light on an interesting twist to
the Astros now that they are a team that most everyone believes
could reach the World Series. It showed whenever there is a loss,
no longer is the water-cooler conversation going to be about the
hitter or pitcher the Astros need to acquire, or the tough upcoming
schedule, or the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Talk is going to be about Dierker. A year ago, Dierker
honeymooned with Astros fans all the way to the division crown.
Hawaiian shirts were all the rage. He handled players and pitchers
masterfully. Nothing was Dierk's fault because, after all, he was
Dierk. The beloved Wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker under scrutiny
</P>
<P>
   But after a decision Friday night that Dierker himself called
``against the grain of my usual philosophy,'' Dierker realizes the
only thing worse than being the skipper of a bad team is being the
skipper of a great team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's under the microscope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the glass Friday was Dierker's decision to walk Chicago's
Jeff Blauser, the No. 8 hitter, and pitch to pitcher Mark Clark,
who was a dismal 1-for-45 going into the crucial sixth-inning
at-bat. The move loaded the bases and, worse, according to the
big-league manager's manual, put another man in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, of course, cracked his bat but broke almost all Astros
hopes with a two-run single that made it 5-1. Fans shook their
heads over Dierker's decision. Then after the comeback fell short,
they called the postgame shows from cellular phones and _ could
this have happened a year ago? _ griped about the manager's call.
Dierker all but called the shows, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was certainly the most unorthodox thing I've done since
I've had this job,'' Dierker said of walking Blauser, who was a
mere 2-for-18 in his past five games. ``I thought it had a chance
to work. It didn't. That was two runs.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the ballgame. And that was Dierker's welcome to life as
the skipper of a team with great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have pitched to him in almost every situation,''
Dierker said. ``I wouldn't believe it myself that I would have done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did, and it told us how much things have changed for
Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind (the second-guessing),'' he said. ``It's one of
those things that happen when things are going great and people are
watching you. It's what makes baseball great. Because you play
every day, there's something to talk about every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Astros fans will talk. Probably, it will be the usual
discussion about how far this team can go. But if things go bad,
then talk will be about the manager.

BRAVES BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Atlanta Braves struggled in San Diego, but by
the time they moved up the freeway to Dodger Stadium they were back
on cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers, who beat the lowly Florida Marlins once
in a three-game series, offered little resistance to the National
League's best team Friday night with a 5-2 loss in front of 43,560
fans.
</P>
<P>
   There was little suspense after the Braves' Andres Galarraga hit
a three-run homer in the fourth inning off Dave Mlicki. The
Dodgers, already sluggish with six losses in their previous nine
games against sub-.500 opponents, were playing without
right-fielder Gary Sheffield, who was sidelined with a sprained
right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   That forced the Dodgers to put Matt Luke in right and Trenidad
Hubbard in left against rookie right-hander Kevin Millwood (14-6),
who defeated the Dodgers in May at Atlanta but left after five
innings with a sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Luke and Hubbard combined for one infield hit in eight at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also struck out in the evening's wild-card race,
dropping six-games behind leader Chicago. San Francisco and New
York, both ahead of the Dodgers for the wild card, also won.
</P>
<P>
   As the game wore on, the Dodgers' only chance was in getting to
the Braves' vulnerable bullpen, which has blown 11 of 41 save
opportunities this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, former Dodger Rudy Seanez became the third Braves
pitcher and allowed infield hits to Eric Young and Hubbard. But
Seanez, known best for his blazing, but often uncontrollable
fastball, slipped a changeup past Raul Mondesi, who had homered in
the fourth, for a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros followed with run-scoring single, giving him 600
career RBI. Only Steve Garvey, Ron Cey, Willie Davis and Bill
Russell have accomplished that in Los Angeles Dodgers history.
</P>
<P>
   But Seanez recovered and blew a fastball by Luke for the final
out.
</P>
<P>
   Luke, expected to get far more playing time in left now that the
club has decided to bench Bobby Bonilla, finished 0-4 with three
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg, who has replaced struggling Mark Wohlers as
the Braves' closer, pitched a perfect ninth for his 19th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves dropped two of three in San Diego but won the final
game to remain ahead of the Padres for the best record in the
National League. Surprisingly, they are 8-9 against Houston, San
Diego and the Cubs, three teams they could meet in the post season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, now 0-4 against the Braves this season, provided no
such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Until the fourth, Mlicki (6-6) had not allowed a hit before
Atlanta second baseman Keith Lockhart opened the inning with a
sharp single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones walked, bringing up Galarraga, who had a 13-game
hitting streak snapped Wednesday in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga worked the count to 3-2 before crushing an outside
fastball into the stands in right center for a three-run homer. It
was his 37th, moving him ahead of Colorado's Vinny Castilla into
fourth place among National League leaders. It traveled 431 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko followed with a double off the glove of first
baseman Eric Karros that originally was called an error. With Javy
Lopez at the plate, Klesko moved to third on a wild pitch and
scored on a single by Michael Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki retired the final two batters in the inning, including
Millwood who sprained his right ankle running out a ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood delayed the bottom of the fourth for several minutes
while trainers retaped his ankle. He ran to the mound without a
limp, but Braves manager Bobby Cox came out after just a few warmup
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Six outs from qualifying for a victory, Millwood remained in the
game. But it was clear he wasn't the same. His first batter was
Mondesi, who almost didn't play after fouling a pitch off his left
ankle the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood fell behind 1-0 then threw a fastball Mondesi drove
halfway up the left-field pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   For Mondesi, who had just three hits in 20 at-bats on the
homestand, it was his 26th homer but just his first since hitting
two Aug. 2 in New York.

MONTGOMERIE BURNS U.S. SPECTATORS WITH HOT GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ For a place more whitebread than downtown
Norman Rockwell, Sahalee had an unusual PGA Championship
leaderboard Friday _ an older, wealthier version of ``We Are the
World,'' heavy on the khaki.
</P>
<P>
   One guy's from Fiji, of East Indian heritage. Another guy is
half-Thai. There's somebody from Australia, and one from Scotland.
For awhile, there was a gent, Carlos Franco, doing well from the
noted golfing hotbed of Paraguay, which produces international
sports figures as often as the Amish turn out porn stars.
</P>
<P>
   To complete this mystery box of golfing chocolates, there's even
a Gump.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the guy from Purgatory, Colin Montgomerie, who came
farther and felt better than any of his fellow heavy-mileage
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Vijay Singh, Tiger Woods, Steve Elkington and Scott
(Don't Call Me Forrest) Gump had reasons to delight in an afternoon
of sun and birds. But Montgomerie, the Scotsman who has been in the
oral crosshairs of American galleries, not only had a hot day, he
felt warm.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he was decidedly cool to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to ask you this ...'' began the inquisitor after a
round of 3-under 67 left Montgomerie one stroke off Singh's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't then,'' Monty retorted. ``Just don't ask it. If you hate
to ask it, don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The scribe persisted: Any personal troubles on the course,
Monty?
</P>
<P>
   ``None at all,'' he said, momentarily relenting. ``The crowds
here have been super, and I've enjoyed myself playing, as I always
do in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that Montgomerie is not prone to diplomacy, it
wasn't likely that he was giving the obligatory air kiss to his
Redmond hosts. But a second source is always helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been terrific,'' said Eimear Montgomerie, who accompanied
her husband around the course. ``The crowds have been very
supportive and polite. It's been very pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different kettle of fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago at the U.S. Open in San Francisco, the fish was a
bit stinky. Hecklers were sufficiently annoying that police had to
accompany Montgomerie from mid-second round on. There were similar
troubles at the Open the previous year at Congressional near
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   After that tourney, in which he finished second, Montgomerie
found a quiet place away from fans and most media and cried _ a far
cry from the aristocratic arrogance that he sometimes conveys.
</P>
<P>
   Some Yank fans couldn't forgive him for his role in twice
whipping the U.S. Ryder Cup team, as well as his typically blunt
remarks about the American team. Up until this week, the verbal
sniping persisted.
</P>
<P>
   It would be swell to assume that folks here are merely more
polite. However, given the amount of airheaded applause given to
poor shotmaking by Fred Couples, Tom Watson, John Daly and others,
golf naivet &UR; ufacute &LR; e cannot be discounted. Not to mention the fact
that a lot of people just don't care about an issue that's
important only to those who tend to subscribe to the Golf Channel
and eat with Titlest-brand flatware.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the result was earnest credit for good golf,
which Montgomerie supplied. Phil Mickelson, the only American in
Monty's threesome, drew the bigger hand from the galleries, and
South African Ernie Els was cheered. But aside from one numbskull
who imitated a whining baby as Montgomerie moved up the 12th
fairway, the Seattle fish kettle was all bouillabaisse .
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, the leading money winner on the European PGA Tour
the last five years, was more pleased with the turn in his putting
fortunes than his Q-ratings. After another debacle in last month's
British Open _ he again missed the cut in his native land, for the
fifth time in the last seven Opens _ Montgomerie was sufficiently
dismayed with his greenswork to arrange a private tutorial Sunday
with renowned short-game guru Dave Pelz.
</P>
<P>
   They cleared some time at Seattle Golf Club and worked from
about 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., according to assistant pro Brent Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him in the afternoon on the practice green, he was
hitting quite a few putts and not making many,'' Webber said.
``Obviously, something finally worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on holes 14, 15 and 16, which would have been three
straight birdies except for a narrow miss from 20 feet on 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave oozes confidence and can only make you more confident,''
Montgomerie said. ``I've become more confident on the greens. The
greens (at Seattle Golf Club) were very similar to here, so it was
a great education.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wouldn't be the full Monty without a critical
assessment of something. He saved it for the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 18th is not a favorite of all the players,'' he said. ``I
think I speak on behalf of them all in saying that the 18th is
designed as a par-5, and I believe is a good one. Because the tee's
been moved forward 30 or 40 yards (for a par-4), the tee shot is
the problem. It's almost too tight to land it in (the fairway).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit two drives straight up the middle. And they've both
run into the rough on the right. Because of the 18th and the 6th,
you could almost call the course a par 71.''
</P>
<P>
   The man always has a shot, whether by lip or chip. Perhaps now,
he will no longer have to play it from his American bunker.

TIGER TAKES TUMBLE AS SINGH SINGES SAHALEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Just when everyone thought they had Sahalee
Country Club all figured out, the Tiger Woods Open became the Equal
Opportunity Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   A faster, drier Redmond course Friday sent Woods tumbling out of
the lead and elevated four impoverished players past him as the
80th PGA Championship reached its halfway point.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh, frequently a contender but never a winner in the
PGA's showcase event, broke from the pack to take a one-stroke lead
over Colin Montgomerie, Scott Gump and Steve Stricker _ all players
seeking their first victory in a golf major. Singh shot a
course-record-tying 66, matching Woods' first-day effort, and leads
with a 4-under-par 136 total.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was two strokes back, tied with five players, and grateful
to be so close. After suggesting that Sahalee wouldn't be able to
muzzle golf's greatest players and then shooting a course record,
he struggled.
</P>
<P>
   One birdie. He had seven the first day, throwing darts. Nothing
would stick Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He swore loudly while three-putting the fourth hole. He slammed
his club after launching a tee shot into a bunker on the 12th.
Finishing at 2-over-par 72, Woods was much more contrite regarding
Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't put a whole lot of water on this golf course,
it's going to be very difficult to shoot a low number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A call for wet stuff in the Pacific Northwest is almost
ludicrous. Woods, however, won't get any help from Mother Nature,
and might be better served paying off the greenskeepers. Cooler
temperatures but no rain have been forecast for the final two
rounds Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-four players won't be around to check the moisture
levels. They missed the cut. The field, not the course, was watered
down considerably Friday. Ben Crenshaw, John Daly, David Duval, Jim
Furyk, Lee Janzen, Tom Kite, Justin Leonard, Jose-Maria Olazabal,
Jesper Parnevik, Payne Stewart, Tom Watson and Lee Westwood all
left early. As did all 25 club pros.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara is still around. The British Open and Masters
champion sits three shots off the lead as he attempts to match the
late Ben Hogan as the only player to win three majors in one
season. O'Meara shot even-par 70 in his second trip around Sahalee,
providing heroics. He chipped one in from 50 yards for a birdie on
the par-4 sixth hole, and eagled the par-5 11th with a 25-foot putt
from the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased and proud of the fact that after two rounds, I've
played as well as I have and at least given myself a chance going
into the weekend,'' O'Meara said.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, a 35-year-old Fijian who has five PGA Tour victories and
18 more worldwide, moved in front of the field by birdieing five of
the first nine holes in the morning and playing carefully when the
course firmed up on his back nine. He used his driver just once, on
the 15th hole.
</P>
<P>
   A methodical player known for his intense practice habits, Singh
has finished fourth, fifth and 13th in the previous PGA
Championships. His final round has been the problem _ it hasn't
been enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to have a different mindset, but obviously the
pressure is going to make you do that,'' Singh said. ``I've played
a lot of weekends going into the lead or close to the lead. But
this is something different. ... I'm just going to go out there and
try to make it feel like a normal tournament as much as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Singh left for an hour of work on the driving range.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, a Scotsman unpopular with American galleries, shot
67 to give himself hope. He hasn't won a major, finishing as a U.S.
Open runner-up twice and second in the 1995 PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come very close a number of times, more than most,''
Montgomerie said. ``Obviously, there's a reason why I've come over
here, and I haven't come over here to actually finish second. I've
got a good position now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker's situation could have been so much better. He was
5-under-par when he teed off with a 5-iron on the par-3 17th hole.
The ball sailed over five ducks floating in the greenside lake, but
didn't reach the green, 215 yards away. Wind was a factor. He took
a double-bogey 5 after getting wet, and fell from his temporary
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no clue where the wind was coming from,'' said
Stricker's caddy, Jimmy Walker. ``I probably had him so confused.
There was a lot of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gump provided more confusion Friday by putting his name high on
the leaderboard. People aren't used to seeing it. A former Nike
Tour player, he has struggled to keep his card, let alone win his
first PGA Tour event. He led briefly, reaching 5-under-par through
14 holes before consecutive bogeys bumped him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I haven't been in this position too many times, so
I'm having fun,'' Gump said.
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Opportunity Invitational demands nothing less.

FREDDIE GETTING READY FOR SERIOUS COUPLEHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ After barely making the cut Friday, Fred
Couples began thinking ahead to preparations for his next major _
his marriage to Thais Bren.
</P>
<P>
   Couples announced that he and Bren would wed Sept. 12 at a
location he wouldn't reveal yet. The wedding plans seemed to take
the sting out of a disappointing 5-over par 145 that nearly kept
him out of the final two days of the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it takes any practice to get ready for that,''
Couples said about the pending marriage ceremony. ``I know my golf
game has suffered, and maybe that will be a fun day. She's a great
lady, and I can't wait for that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the ceremony would be open to Seattle fans, Couples
chuckled: ``If they can find where this wedding is. It's going to
be very, very small, but we're going to have a reception up here
later on.''
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Couples, who is divorced from his first wife,
said he plans to return to live in the Seattle area once the rigors
of traveling the professional golf tour subside. He now lives in
the more centrally located Plano, Texas. As soon as he finished his
round Friday, Couples headed out to look at property on Camano
Island, where his good friend John Bracken of Greater Seattle Golf
Events lives.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't wait to see if he made the cut, thinking he probably
wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that planned whether I shot 55 or 85 (Friday),'' Couples
said. ``I plan to live up there. It's not too far from Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Couples has been spending most of his time off the tour
living with Bren in Los Angeles. Bren last year underwent treatment
for breast cancer at the same time Couples' father was being
treated for the leukemia that took his life last Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Couples' mind was on things besides his golf score
Friday. Instead of talking about how he plans to get back into
contention, he sounded like someone ready to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started Thursday, I was just a little bit off, and I
wish I'd had a couple more practice rounds to get ready,'' he said.
``I just wasn't good enough for four hours, and that's why I'm
shooting the way I've been shooting. And now I look forward to
Sept. 12.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance to date is not much different from his
experiences at the U.S. Open and the British Open, the only two
tournaments he has played in the past month before the PGA
Championship. At the U.S. Open, he finished 17-over and tied for
53rd. At the British Open, he finished 19-over and tied for 66th.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his erratic play, Couples is trying to have fun in his
hometown, staying in a home on the course and reveling in the
Seattle fans who lined the ropes rooting for their hometown hero.
On the 13th tee, he was greeted by a sign that read: ``Freddie for
President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it is a once-in-a-lifetime deal, and I really have a
good time playing out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Couples only wished his fans could have done a little more to
help him out on the course Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the rough a lot and felt I could have used them to
kick it out a few times,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he plays poorly over the weekend, Couples still is
singing the praises of Seattle and Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle has put on a great show,'' Couples said. ``I'm always
proud of Seattle. I get a kick when I'm out on the tour hearing
everything about (former coach) George Karl and the Sonics, and
talking with some of my friends about Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me growing up here, I'm never around, so to come back has
been a real treat.''

GUMP? HE'S TIED FOR SECOND, YOU KNOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ With all of its cedars and firs, Sahalee
already had a forest. Now it has a Gump.
</P>
<P>
   Second-round PGA Championship leader Vijay Singh is recognized
worldwide as a man with impeccable credentials, winner of 23
professional tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Gump is recognized by his wife Christine. You could slide
his resume under the door. He has two Nike Tour wins.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gump shot a 69 and is tied for second with Colin
Montgomerie and Steve Stricker.
</P>
<P>
   In seven years of grinding, Gump has never won on the PGA Tour,
let alone a major. This is his first of the year and his first PGA
since 1992 when he finished in a tie for 79th.
</P>
<P>
   If Gump has any connection with the fans at Sahalee, it is
because of his last name. He's the box-of-chocolates guy, and
Friday his life was good.
</P>
<P>
   As the Tiger throng watched another golfer elsewhere, two dozen
fans watched Gump's threesome at the fifth hole. The little
leaderboard that travels along with each group incorrectly showed
playing partner Ronald McDougal at 2-under and Gump at 6-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which one's Gump?'' asked a spectator from the bleacher seats
at the 18th green as Gump's threesome walked up the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows,'' came the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one with the white shirt in the trap,'' said another
fan, finally figuring it out.
</P>
<P>
   When Jim Britt of Redmond saw Gump's name on the leaderboard, he
thought it was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they did that to lighten up the folks around the
green. I have never heard of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gump climbed into the trap and awkwardly addressed his ball,
beached on a sidehill lie. He took a swipe at it, lofting the ball
gently toward the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get in there, Forrest,'' urged John Wirth of Juanita.
</P>
<P>
   Gump's ball nearly followed the order, hitting the flagstick and
ricocheting 5 feet left of the hole. He sank the par putt and
headed to the TBS tower for a rare national TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   Gump is 32 years old, long and lanky at 6-foot-2 and 185 pounds.
He is a straight hitter who has used his driver only once in two
days here. Friday, Gump went from missing cuts to making putts,
draining a 12-foot par-saving, momentum-building putt at No. 1. At
No. 6, he buried a 60-footer for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, after he birdied the 14th hole from 12 feet, the
man on the television said: ``Scott Gump is the new leader at
5-under par.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he bogeyed 16 and 17 coming in, acceptable mistakes,
Gump thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it,'' he said. ``I haven't been in this position too
many times, so I'm having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   This is who will be chasing the more prominent names this
weekend: a player who has finished second twice on tour, shot 62 in
the second round at Hartford and won nearly $300,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   He seems nice enough. A Golf World columnist used Gump as an
example of what's wrong with the PGA Tour, allowing non-winners to
remain exempt as long as they finish in the top 125 on the money
list. He was 109th last year.
</P>
<P>
   Restraining the temptation to fire off an oh-yeah rebuttal, Gump
merely said: ``Obviously, my record is not that good, but I'm
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Breston of North Vancouver captured him perfectly: ``I would
call Scott Gump a journeyman.''

PANEL URGES REMOVAL OF A TOWN JUSTICE IN NEW YORK STATE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state judicial review panel has decided that a town
justice from Rockland County should be removed from the bench for a
series of remarks he made that made light of victims of domestic
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Ralph T. Romano, an elected justice of the Haverstraw
Town Court for the last 20 years, compromised his office with the
use of profane language, ill-placed humor on the bench and acerbic
behavior toward detectives between 1993 and 1997, the New York
state Commission on Judicial Conduct said in a report issued on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Romano, a part-time lawyer, ``exhibited intemperate and biased
behavior, disregard of the law and an egregious assertion of
influence for private gain,'' the commission concluded.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission seemed most concerned with his attitude
toward victims of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 case, a man was accused of violating an order of
protection by beating his wife with a telephone. ``What's wrong
with this?'' the judge asked during the arraignment in the case,
according to the commission. ``You need to keep these women in line
now and again.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said that he was reluctant to issue orders of
protection or put abusive husbands out of the house unless the
victims could show extraordinary proof, such as a ``turban of
bandages,'' the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Romano's lawyer said he would appeal the decision to the state
court of appeals. If the court agrees with the panel's
determination, Romano will be banned from holding judicial office
in New York.

EDITORIAL: TOLL PHOBIA AND AMERICA'S INTERSTATES  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Aug. 15:
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Highway Commission's interest in imposing tolls on
a stretch of one of its Interstates has trucking organizations
talking like latter-day participants in the Boston Tea Party. Last
week, the truckers decried using anything beyond existing fuel
taxes to maintain the Interstates, and deplored the federal program
that will authorize toll experiments in three states. Farther west,
the San Diego region is acquiring more transponders to expand the
use of variable tolls that motorists with no passengers pay to use
I-15's high-occupancy-vehicle express lanes. Both toll experiments
will test the proposition that critical stretches of the nation's
Interstate system have more in common with telephone or cable lines
than they do with parks.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas' interest in the federal experiment is based on the
premise that many of America's Interstates cannot be maintained by
gas taxes alone, even with the generous financing provided under
the latest federal highway bill. This pilot program will allow
Washington to determine whether giving states the power to charge
tolls on their Interstates is a reasonable way to generate funds
for repair and rehabilitation. Under Washington's $198-billion
Transportation Equity Act, a state must demonstrate that it is
strapped before it is allowed to impose tolls.
</P>
<P>
   The law also authorizes 15 variable-pricing experiments that use
tolls to reduce congestion and manage traffic conditions, with an
option to apply the revenues to mass transit. Many of these give
those driving alone the right to use HOV lanes if they pay a toll
that is higher during peak periods and lower in off-peak periods.
This process will make it possible to learn what kinds of variable
tolls can help end parking-lot conditions at rush hour and to what
degree they discriminate against those who cannot afford the price
of a shorter commute.
</P>
<P>
   Except in a few states, placing the words ``toll'' and
``Interstate'' in the same sentence has been anathema in America.
Both Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower, the father of the
Interstate highway system, saw toll financing as a good way to
build the system. Eisenhower abandoned his preference for tolls
only after his advisers ruled, perhaps correctly at the time, that
tolls would not work except in the East's densely populated
precincts.
</P>
<P>
   America has changed a lot since then. Many of the nation's
largest metropolises need a variety of ways to reduce congestion.
Transponders and other technologies have eliminated the need for
toll plazas and even for slowing down to pay a toll. Both
developments suggest that what appealed to FDR and Eisenhower just
may have legs after all.

   CLINTON-DEFENSE (Washington) _ Developments on White House
strategy for Clinton's Monday testimony before the Kenneth Starr
grand jury. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-NH-VOICES (Dover, N.H.) _ In 1992 Bill Clinton, his New
Hampshire primary campaign wounded by allegations of extra-marital
affairs and questions about his draft record, defied speculation
that he would have to drop out and instead, at the Elks hall here,
vowed to stick it out until ``the last dog dies.'' Voters rewarded
his perseverance with a second-place showing in this
first-in-the-nation primary, just enough to keep his candidacy
alive. Today, in that same Elks hall, with Clinton facing possibly
the most perilous moment of his presidency when he testifies before
a grand jury on Monday, club members and buyers at an antiques
auction voiced yet another chorus of defiant indifference to the
allegations against him. Pausing for emphasis, Bob Carroll, an
auctioneer, said, ``Leave. The poor man. Alone.'' By Carey
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ISOLATION (Washington) _ Faced with the most portentous
day of his turbulent career _ detailed questioning under oath on
Monday about his private life _ President Clinton has almost no one
he can turn to, say his friends and current and former aides. No
one outside a tiny group of advisers has enough information about
the president's predicament to give him advice. And if others
learned the necessary facts, they could be compelled to share that
information with the grand jury investigating his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky. By James Bennet.

The rally capped a week in which the index swung more than 700
points, or 11 percent. Few investors think that the volatility is
over. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-ASSESS (Undated) _ With Russia facing financial turmoil,
Asia sinking deeper into depression and President Clinton in a
political crisis, the blindingly bright economic picture of the
past couple of years suddenly looks murkier. What makes things a
bit scary is that the economy has now shifted into much slower
gear. And slowdowns _ which make it harder for businesses and
consumers to shrug off random blows _ have a way of turning into
recessions. By Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   WALL-STREET-NORTH (New York) _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has
signed an agreement to move into a new 1 million-square-foot office
tower on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, according to

The mayor, along with a team of conservationists, took me on a tour

once in a three-game series, offered little resistance to the
National League's best team Friday night with a 5-2 loss in front
of 43,560 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is getting old really fast,'' said Eric Karros, who drove
in the Dodgers' final run in the eighth inning. ``Against the
Braves, there is no margin for error. With some teams you might get
a second chance. Now it seems like we are one of those teams.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little suspense after the Braves' Andres Galarraga hit
a three-run home run in the fourth inning off Dave Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the ballgame right there,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, already sluggish with six losses in their previous
nine games against sub-.500 opponents, were playing without
right-fielder Gary Sheffield, who was sidelined with a sprained
right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi did play after fouling a ball off his left foot
Thursday and hit his 26th homer. But it was just his first since
Aug. 2. Sheffield clearly was missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take some anti-inflammatory (medication) tonight and see
what happens,'' Sheffield said. ``I can't tell the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury forced the Dodgers to put Matt Luke in right and
Trenidad Hubbard in left against rookie right-hander Kevin Millwood
(14-6), who defeated the Dodgers in May at Atlanta but left after
five innings with a sprained right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Luke and Hubbard combined for one infield hit in eight at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   That happens, especially when part-timers are asked to step up.
But Hubbard blundered in the fifth with runners at first and second
and two outs. The Dodgers had Mondesi and Karros, the club's only
surviving sluggers, coming up. But on a 3-1 count, Hubbard went for
the big swing and flied out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers struck out in the evening's wild-card race, dropping
six-games behind leader Chicago. San Francisco and New York, both
ahead of the Dodgers for the wild card, also won.
</P>
<P>
   As the game wore on, the Dodgers' only chance was in getting to
the Braves' vulnerable bullpen, which has blown 11 of 41 save
opportunities this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, former Dodger Rudy Seanez became the third Braves
pitcher. He allowed infield hits to Eric Young and Hubbard. But
Seanez, known best for his blazing but often uncontrollable
fastball, slipped a change-up past Mondesi for a called third
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Karros followed with run-scoring single, giving him 600 career
RBI. Only Steve Garvey, Ron Cey, Willie Davis and Bill Russell have
accomplished that in Los Angeles Dodgers history.
</P>
<P>
   But Seanez recovered and blew a fastball by Luke for the final
out.
</P>
<P>
   Luke, expected to get far more playing time in left now that the
club has decided to bench Bobby Bonilla, finished 0-4 with three
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg, who has replaced struggling Mark Wohlers as
the Braves' closer, pitched the a perfect ninth for his 19th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves (81-41) dropped two of three in San Diego but won the
final game to remain ahead of the Padres for the best record in the
National League. Surprisingly, they are 8-9 against Houston, San
Diego and the Cubs, three teams they could meet in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, now 0-4 against the Braves this season, provided no
such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Until the fourth, Mlicki (6-6) had not allowed a hit until
Atlanta second baseman Keith Lockhart opened the inning with a
sharp single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones walked, bringing up Galarraga, who had a 13-game
hitting streak snapped Wednesday in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga worked the count to 3-2 before crushing an outside
fastball into the stands in right center for a three-run homer. It
was his 37th, moving him ahead of Colorado's Vinny Castilla into
fourth place among NL leaders. It traveled 431 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood injured his ankle running out a grounder later in the
inning. He delayed the bottom of the fourth for several minutes
while trainers retaped his ankle. He ran to the mound without a
limp, but Cox came out after just a few warmup pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Six outs from qualifying for a victory, Millwood remained in the
game. But it was clear he wasn't the same. His first batter was
Mondesi, who drove a 1-0 fastball halfway up the left-field
pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I crossed first, I rolled my ankle,'' Millwood said. ``It
was sore but I could still pitch. The home run ball to Mondesi was
just a bad pitch. It had nothing to do with my ankle. After that I
made some good pitches to get out of the inning.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In parts and pockets of Africa, there is an extra season every
year. It is called the hunger season. That is when, said Martha
Carey of Doctors Without Borders, ``people forage for food _ they
strip wild plants, they dig for fish in mud flats.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Sudan, it is the hunger season and they are slaughtering
their cows. ``Cows are their last insurance policy,'' she said.
``They cannot be replaced. After that, they have nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The world's attention has been focused on Africa lately because
of the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and
because of the extreme suffering of the Sudanese, who are again on
the run from yet another cycle of war between a Muslim north and a
traditionalist and Christian south. But a million other stories of
deprivation and intractable hunger just a notch less severe never
get told because they are so common.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David Guzman, a Roman Catholic priest from Colombia who
is a missionary in Africa, was riding the subway in New York
recently when he saw passengers looking at newspaper pictures from
the Sudan and expressing shock. ``Oh, my God,'' he said. ``If only
they could have seen the place where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The place where he lives and works is a barren stretch of
northern Kenya where, in the hunger season, people slit the throats
of cattle to draw enough blood to drink to sustain life. Then they
carefully heal the wound to save the cow, the most important of
capital goods, for the next crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government sometimes gives them maize,'' Guzman said, but
never enough. ``There is no electricity, no water supply, no
rivers, no hills, no food. This is a semi-arid place and you cannot
cultivate crops. The people are always sick. The health center is
300 kilometers away and there are no cars, no buses.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman was on a lonely errand in New York, trying to get small
donations for water pumps and maybe a used ambulance. He toured
Catholic parishes after being shooed away by the church hierarchy
because the list of supplicants for official help is already too
long. In small churches, he tells his story of official
indifference, tribal warfare, natural disasters, relentless
diseases and other blows. ``Just when you think you are getting
somewhere, more bad things come,'' is how he describes it.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics tell the story. Of the 45 countries at the bottom
of the Human Development Index, a people-centered measure of
progress published annually by the United Nations Development
Program, 35 are African. Only Africa's Mediterranean fringe and the
southern tip of the continent escape the category. Elsewhere, life
expectancy hovers between 40 and 50 years, sometimes lower. Half or
fewer of the people in this vast area of disadvantage have access
to health care, clean water or toilets. Daily caloric intake is a
third or more below that of Mexico or China.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund, found in 1997 that while the
world average of deaths among children below age 5 was 89 in 1,000
births, the African average was 174 per 1,000. The children who
survive have to fend off pneumonia, tuberculosis, malaria and now
AIDS. Immunization rates for childhood diseases are often low in
sub-Saharan Africa, Unicef reported. Only South Asia, led by India,
has more childhood malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   It does not have to be that way, and was not always so, said
Thelma Awori, director for Africa of the U.N. Development Program.
Mrs. Awori, taking a long look back and searching for lessons that
could help in planning for a better future, is concentrating on
Africa's people rather than its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When independence came to Africa, people had a lot of hope
about what governments would do,'' she said. ``At that time
governments themselves were hopeful about what they could do. Then
we got into the '70s and the '80s _ the times of structural
adjustment _ when they had to shift their thinking. Governments
found they really could not do all they thought they could do. And
then people's hopes were more or less dashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Structural adjustment, a policy developed by international
lending organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, demanded that countries living beyond their means
reduce spending on public projects and cut subsidies that often
kept the cost of living down in poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in Uganda in the '60s, we had strong community
development,'' she said. ``Women knew how to feed their children.
They were taught how to wash their dishes. They were taught to make
tablecloths even though some people said, `We have no tables.' And
now?''
</P>
<P>
   In the same villages, Mrs. Awori said, she sees women unable to
feed their babies. Elsewhere, schooling has declined as tens of
thousands of children flee civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Africa is slipping back. Even where there is no
conflict, governments forced to make choices about what to cut from
their budgets often safeguard the official ``fat'' and slice away
the ``soft'' projects like literacy programs, agricultural
extension services and adult education. ``The people are on their
own again,'' Mrs. Awori said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our argument with most governments is, `Why don't you cut the
military spending?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What has been lost is rapport between governments and the
people, Mrs. Awori said. Her agency is trying to rebuild that, but
from the bottom up, with grants to nongovernmental organizations
and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local development fund goes straight to grassroots
government,'' she said. ``The local authorities learn how to take
charge, they learn how to account for money. They learn how to
plan. They learn how to link themselves up with the communities.
That's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Depending too much on outside help means focusing on where
people fail, she added. ``We are teaching people to use their own
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Awori also channels money and other support to women's
groups like the fast-growing Movement of African Women, founded by
a member of Zambia's Parliament, Inonge Lewanika. Millions of
African women have been set back by bad governance. Tens of
thousands have had to run from ethnic warfare and have suffered
rape and the brutal deaths of children, husbands and other family
members. Some are now saying they want to help put an end to this
perpetual horror and they are building computer networks to reach
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had to run,'' Mrs. Awori said. ``It is a very, very
humiliating experience. You are just running, You don't know where
you are running to. You could be running into the person who is
going to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   In material terms, Africa is rich in resources, richer than many
Asian countries. But wealth and the political power out of which it
grows are rarely shared equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have monumental problems,'' said Legwaila Joseph Legwaila,
Botswana's representative at the United Nations. ``Sometimes we are
seen as the laughingstock of humanity. But we can be an organized
community, vast as the continent is, different as the cultures
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Legwaila points to the experience of the 14-nation Southern
African Development Community. A number of its members, including
Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, are similar to
nations like Russia, Peru and Turkey in human development terms.
SADC has a system of assigning areas of development to member
nations. Livestock and drought research is done by Botswana,
fisheries by Malawi, food security by Zimbabwe, water resources by
Lesotho and so on. Experts in these nations carry out studies and
share information. Grain stocks are stored regionally against
shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SADC arrangement is unique in Africa,'' Legwaila said. But
its success also rests on peace, democracy and stability, he added,
attributes not found in many other regions of the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace _ that is all that is required of Africa,'' Legwaila
said. ``My country is almost permanently drought-stricken, but
because there is so much peace, so much democracy _ and the
government is one of the most incorruptible on the continent _ no
one has ever died from starvation.''

   Lying is bad. So Americans say. They tell pollsters they are no
good at it, it is difficult, they rarely lie. In the tradition of
Lake Wobegon (``where the women are strong, the men are good
looking and all of the children are above average''), they think
they are more honest than everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lying is everywhere: lies to children, lies to voters, lies
to the Internal Revenue Service, lies under oath. People lie to
avoid embarrassment, to spare feelings, to get their way. And, when
confronted with a lie, they justify it: The lie was harmless, the
truth would have hurt, the ends justified the means.
</P>
<P>
   They are even willing to overlook lying in others. Boston Globe
columnist Mike Barnicle still has his job, even after misleading
his readers or his editors or his viewers or all three. President
Clinton is widely believed to have lied about his sex life, yet
most Americans seem not to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone lies about sex,'' Jerry Seinfeld said during his
Broadway show when someone from the audience asked for a joke about
Clinton. ``People lie during sex. If it weren't for lies, there'd
be no sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to tell the truth Monday in the grand jury
investigation of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. But
responding honestly to a narrowly defined question may represent a
sin of omission that does not constitute honesty as most people
know it.
</P>
<P>
   Sex may be the all-time favorite exception to the rule that
honesty is the best policy, research on lying and anecdotal
evidence suggest. But there are other common situations where many
Americans think it may be all right not to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is okay to lie to hide something that will be used unfairly
against you or others, or to to conceal information that an
inquisitor has no right to have (the classic
Nazis-at-the-door-while-the-Jews-are-in-the-attic exception,
stretched in contemporary life to justify paying the baby sitter
off the books because the employer cannot afford child care
otherwise).
</P>
<P>
   _ Elected officials can lie in a national emergency to protect
hostages, mislead the enemy, win the war. (Though Americans tend
not to make a case for politicians lying, they take it for granted
that their elected officials do as a rule.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Little white lies are fine, many people insist, when the
intent is benign (``What a beautiful baby, necktie, salad bowl!'')
</P>
<P>
   _ Lies to help other people are more acceptable than those to
help oneself. A friend might lie to a friend, or a parent to a
child, when the truth could hurt and the deception would not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle here, if there is a principle, is you must never
lie unless you must,'' said Alexander Nehamas, a professor of
philosophy at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironically, one of the most necessary lies we tell our
children is you must never lie. Then we turn around and, when it
suits us, pretend to believe the principle ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, little support for lying in religious
literature. St. Augustine opposed it absolutely. Christian and
Jewish traditions strongly discourage it. To the Catholic Church,
it is a sin against God's gift of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Honesty, on the other hand, is the foundation upon which
relationships and many societies are built. Without it, it is said,
there can be no trust. Widespread lying destroys the fabric of
democratic societies, in which the necessary assumption is that
people mostly tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to tell a lie, there had better be a serious
moral reason for it,'' said Joseph Hough, professor of Christian
ethics and dean of Vanderbilt Divinity School. ``Not every single
thing that's unpleasant is a moral reason. I think you can find
gentle ways to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the religious literature allows exceptions. In Catholic
moral tradition, there is the so-called principle of overriding
right, which recognizes that there are times when a more important
principle than truth-telling is at stake, such as the principle of
protecting human life.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Joel Roth, a professor of Talmud and rabbinic literature
at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, said that
while there is little tolerance in rabbinic literature for lying,
and while lying is always forbidden in a judicial proceeding, some
white lying may be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a passage in chapter 18 of the book of Genesis in which
God omits to mention to Abraham an unflattering comment by his
wife. From that passage and at least one other, Roth said, rabbis
deduce that some white lies may be acceptable in preserving family
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   There is little research on how and when Americans lie. But
Bella DePaulo, a professor of psychology at the University of
Virginia, recently studied everyday lying by 77 college students
and 70 individuals in a community. All kept weeklong diaries
detailing their interactions and the lies they told.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DePaulo found that virtually everyone lied. The students
averaged two lies a day, the others one. The vast majority of lies
were told to spare the liar embarrassment or to make him or her
look better. The benefit was psychic, not material.
</P>
<P>
   In her studies of serious lying, as opposed to everyday lying,
Dr. DePaulo has found that a quarter of all serious lies were told
to cover an affair. She said scholarly literature on lying suggests
that Americans also find lying more acceptable when the behavior it
is concealing was discreet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very important distinction between the
acceptability of the lie and the acceptability of the behavior that
the lie is covering up,'' she said. ``If someone says, `It's OK
with me that he lied about it,' they are not saying, `It's OK with
me that he had an affair.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars, including Stephen Carter, a Yale law professor
and author of ``Integrity'' (Basic Books, 1996), suspect that lying
has increased. And when adults accept lying as natural, Carter
says, children learn the lesson that the adult world's rules are
unreliable and open to manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Boston University sociologist Alan Wolfe, who
is researching a book on moral freedom, contends that Americans are
simply learning to write their own moral rules, now that
institutions like the church no longer manage to do it for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are pretty savvy about this,'' said Amy Gutmann,
director of the Center for Human Values at Princeton University.
``They think that some kinds of lies are far less bad than others.
But they think that someone who can lie very well does not have
good character.''

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of Washington rolled its eyes last week when first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton came up with a novel explanation for her
husband's continuing travails.
</P>
<P>
   Having previously cited a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' she
told a reporter from The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that the soggy
mass of scandal surrounding President Clinton was due to an
anti-Arkansas bias. ``They wouldn't be doing this if we were from
some other state,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With her Yale and Wellesley degrees, and her suburban Chicago
pedigree, Mrs. Clinton is oddly cast as a plain-folks defender of
Ozark pride. And it takes some doing to ascribe anti-Arkansas bias
to the Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a Texan who
spent his first two years of college at Harding University in
Searcy, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a real context for Mrs. Clinton's remarks that
goes beyond Arkansas to one of the more pervasive, if
little-discussed, maladies of American life: rube-aphobia.
</P>
<P>
   The term, which was first bandied about in Texas in the 1980s,
does not refer to fear of bumpkins and hicks, but the opposite: the
fear that unless you have the approval of the media powers and
taste makers in Washington, New York and to a lesser extent Los
Angeles, you're treated like a bumpkin or a hick.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and her husband, of course, are anything but rubes.
But if there's an underlying thought in her plaint, it's the
persistent divide between the masters of the universe in America's
three power and media centers and the rest of the country, with
Arkansas as subterranean rock bottom on the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly what she meant; she made a statement of fact
that the rest of us are defined by Washington and New York,'' said
Nathalie Dupree, an Atlantan who is the author of 10 books on
cooking and entertaining. Ms. Dupree says she is often amused at
the degree to which her professional certification depends on
someone in New York taking notice. ``It's like the way New York and
Washington seem to think this whole Clinton business is critical,
and we think it's a waste of time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If any place can engender a sense of being permanently dissed,
it's Arkansas. Even Mississippi, the nation's poorest state, at
least gets stereotyped in terms of both Faulknerian complexity and
abject redneckery.
</P>
<P>
   But dating from a 19th-century best-selling travelogue
derisively titled ``On a Slow Train Through Arkansas'' to H.L.
Mencken's ridicule of ``the miasmic jungles of Arkansas'' to Li'l
Abner and Dogpatch, perhaps no state has had such consistently
dismal public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Lyons, an Arkansas journalist originally from New Jersey (a
state with image problems of its own), said Mrs. Clinton's
statement to The Democrat-Gazette, like her allegations of a ``vast
right-wing conspiracy,'' was a clumsy attempt at making a valid
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk for 15 minutes, you can say something
sensible,'' he said. ``If it's one line, you sound silly.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said Mrs. Clinton was onto something if she was saying
that ignorance of the state, its players and political culture
colored much of the coverage of the all-but-forgotten original
Whitewater scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Jubilation T. Cornpone and Li'l Abner,'' Lyons said.
``Reporters expected a morally deranged world where the governor
makes love to his first cousin and then appoints the idiot spawn
securities commissioner while the hogs scratch their backs on the
front porch.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, just because the rube-aphobic world view has some basis
in reality does not necessarily mean Mrs. Clinton's explanation for
her husband's problems is anything other than defensive pique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hard pressed to buy the idea that Judge Starr is spending
$40 million of the taxpayers' money because he wants to take a
stick and poke it at the good people of Arkansas,'' said Richard
Bearden, executive director of the Arkansas Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   And even many Arkansans have to wonder if the appearance of an
insular political culture and the seamy circus of the past few
years, from Gennifer Flowers to Paula Jones to Monica Lewinsky, is
providing enough gross-out fodder to update old stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmed rube-aphobics might say the fact that even a powerful,
Yale-educated first lady feels so aggrieved is evidence of how
pervasive the malady is. But, then again, maybe it just says
something about how tough it is to be from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the old gag that in the old days when you crossed the
Mississippi there was a sign that said `Texas left and Kansas
right,''' said John Shelton Reed, a University of North Carolina
sociologist. ``Those who couldn't read stayed in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard that from someone from Arkansas. They have a nice
sense of humor if you don't provoke them.''

Congress of Genetics took time out from discussions of cloning and
cancer genes to confront a controversial Chinese law, one that many
experts believe permits doctors to forcibly sterilize people with
serious genetic defects. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-EVACUATE (Kinshasa, Congo) _ The United States, Britain,
France and other Western nations began a hurried final evacuation
of their nationals from Kinshasa on Saturday amid signs that
African-led negotiations to prevent a rebel assault on the capital
would fail. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBS (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ With the outside world
doing little to stop government forces driving tens of thousands of
Kosovo Albanians from home and shelling, looting and burning their
villages, heavily armed Serbian police backed by Yugoslav Army
soldiers are increasing their terror against civilians. By Mike
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CRISIS (Moscow) _ ``In Russia,'' sighed a young man at a
bank, ``things are explained to people less, that's why they fear
things more.'' By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   SWISSBANKS-SETTLE (Geneva) _ The front page of a leading Swiss
newspaper on Friday capsulized the country's ambivalent response to
the accord last week aimed at settling Holocaust-era claims. The
words and imagery highlighted the mix of relief and victimization
that the Swiss feel over the announcement between Jewish
organizations, American politicians and Switzerland. By Elizabeth
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-DAM-DISPUTE (Ralco, Chile) _ The Chilean government and
Endesa, a Spanish-owned electric utility, want to build a $500
million dam project on the Bio-Bio river intended to provide more
than 10 percent of Chile's electricity by 2002. But a dozen Indian

Hansell.
</P>
<P>
   SANFRAN-HOMELESS (San Francisco) _ To many people who live here

find it ideal. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   FARMER-HAY-DONOR (Harvard, Ill.) _ When a fellow farmer gets
into straits, Keith Kingsley knows, good neighbors come to the
rescue with muscle, machinery or feed. It should not matter whether
the family in peril lives down the road or 1,000 miles away, in the
Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANS-GANGVIOLENCE (Window Rock, Ariz.) _ In response to the
surge in violent crime on reservations, President Clinton proposed
increasing the 1999 law-enforcement budget for the Bureau of Indian

</P>
<P>
   CALIF-VOLCANO-TOWN (Mammoth Lakes, Calif.) _ Postcard views of
snow-covered peaks, sparkling lakes and emerald pine forests
surround this resort town 7,800 feet up in the Eastern Sierra. But
to the dismay of residents, when the nation's attention is drawn to
their town next to the Mammoth Mountain ski resort, it most often
focuses on what is going on underground. The town of about 5,000
people sits in the Long Valley Caldera, a 20-mile-long volcanic
basin.
</P>
<P>
   OBIT-BARR (Washington) _ Joel Barr, an electronics engineer
linked to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg who defected to the Soviet
bloc in 1950 and became a leading force in the Kremlin's computer
industry, died in a Moscow hospital on Aug. 1. He was 82 and had

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-DEPOSE _ Veteran prosecutors of perjury cases and legal
scholars are torn over whether President Clinton risks more by
continuing to say he did not have sexual relations with Monica

trying to reconcile it with his earlier testimony in the Paula
Jones lawsuit. By Nina Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   CEMETERY-DEBATE (Washington) _ Space is becoming so scarce at
Arlington National Cemetery that the announcement that three of the

<P>
   Some of the largest commercial sites on the World Wide Web have
agreed to feed information about their customers' reading, shopping
and entertainment habits into a system developed by a Massachusetts
company that is already tracking the moves of more than 30 million
Internet users, recording where they go and what they read, often
without the users' knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the participating Web sites to track
their users so that advertisements can be precisely aimed at the
most likely prospects for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   But while this system guarantees the anonymity of individual
users, the underlying technology disturbs privacy-rights advocates,
who have long worried about the growing ability of online companies
to collect and store personal data about people who use the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Many individual Internet services have begun to amass detailed
records of who uses their sites and how they use them. But this new
industry cooperative represents the most ambitious effort yet to
gather disparate bits of personal information into a central
database containing digital dossiers on potentially every person
who surfs the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Participating sites will include the Lycos-Tripod site, which
was visited by 14.8 million people in July, according to Relevant
Knowledge, a market research firm, and the Geocities virtual
community of more than 2 million personal Web sites that attracted
14.2 million visitors last month.
</P>
<P>
   The system's proponents extol its promise for delivering
precisely directed, sometimes personalized, ads. For example, an
Internet user who looks up tourist information about England on a
travel site in the network might be fed ads for airlines flying
into Heathrow Airport and for hotels in London as he checks sports
scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone comes to your bookstore the first time, you can
find out if they are interested in mountain climbing, organic
gardening and tennis; you can present them books related to their
interests immediately,'' said David Wetherell, the chief executive
of the company behind the Internet system, CMG Information Services
of Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a few large sites, CMG has attracted a host of
smaller participants like NBC Videoseeker and Ticketmaster.
</P>
<P>
   CMG's system and a dozen other similar efforts under development
are rooted in the same marketing needs that have prompted
direct-mail companies to assemble mailing lists using nearly every
publicly available scrap of information on people, from their auto
registrations to their vacation habits.
</P>
<P>
   But while mailing-list companies are limited to identifying
people for mailing lists by broad interests _ for example,
subscribers to fishing magazines _ Internet-based systems can find
a person who reads articles about fishing even if the Web page he
is visiting is part of a general news or recreation site.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet systems can also tighten their focus by, say,
sending an ad from a charter operator to someone who has spent time
reading about deep-sea fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell argues that CMG's system, known as Engage, protects
people's privacy in ways that mailing-list companies never can. In
particular, he says, Engage does not record the name, street or
e-mail address or credit-card numbers of the people it profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it places a unique identifying number on the computer
hard drive of every person who visits one of the participating
sites. That way the system can keep track of all the sites visited
by that computer, regardless of the identity of its user.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the highest road you could possibly take with respect
to privacy,'' Wetherell said. ``We think you can learn a lot more
about someone from their behavior than from their name and
address.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a user can choose not to have his or her surfing
observed, by visiting the company's Web site (www.engage.com) and
selecting an option that will remove the identification number,
known in the language of the Internet as a ``cookie,'' from their
computer. Users can also set their Web browsers not to put any
cookies on their computers, but this can complicate access to some
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy advocates agree that Engage's promise of anonymity
could help protect Internet users from hackers and commercial or
government snoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big long-term concern about privacy is the surreptitious
compilation of every site you click, every page you download, every
product you order into a single database,'' said Marc Rotenberg,
the director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
Washington. ``Anonymity is like solar energy. It's a way to produce
what you want without the unpleasant byproducts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rotenberg and others also say they are concerned about
whether Engage and all the participating sites will strictly
maintain this promise of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engage has done many good things to protect privacy, but my
worry is they are firing the starting gun in the race for the
bottom,'' said Jason Catlett, the president of Junkbusters Corp., a
Green Brook, N.J., privacy consulting firm. ``The worst actors will
be left to use the most sophisticated surveillance techniques as
they please.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last Thursday, in the federal government's first
enforcement action to safeguard privacy on the Internet, the
Federal Trade Commission accused Geocities of selling personal
information about its members. Geocities said it did nothing wrong,
but changed its notification to members about how data about them
would be used.
</P>
<P>
   It is not illegal for Internet services to sell personal
information about their customers, and there are few laws
protecting consumers' privacy in cyberspace. The Clinton
administration's policy is that businesses engaged in electronic
commerce should police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there have been several recent instances in which companies
have either lied outright to their customers or otherwise failed to
live up to their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   For example, America Online Inc., in theory, offers users the
chance to shield their actual identities behind pseudonyms known as
screen names. But the U.S. Navy recently forced the retirement of
an 18-year veteran, Master Chief Petty Officer Timothy R. McVeigh,
after a customer-service representative for America Online violated
the company's policy and identified McVeigh to a Navy investigator
as the owner of a screen name with marital status listed as
``gay.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to avoid such problems, CMG executives said they would
not track some online behavior that could be especially sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to avoid sexual preferences, adult content and
medical information, because they are controversial,'' said Daniel
Jaye, the chief technical officer for Engage.
</P>
<P>
   Engage is the most elaborate system so far for monitoring where
people go and what they do on the Internet. But dozens of other
systems have been created to learn things about users in an attempt
to improve responses to advertising.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Internet technology can supply site owners with some information
about visitors to their sites _ the area code of a dial-up visitor,
for example, the type of computer used, and, in the case of an
office computer, the name of the company.
</P>
<P>
   But these data are unreliable. For example, a computer with the
same address might be used by two or more people.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Web sites are increasingly seeking more
detailed information. They do this by registering people for
contests or services like free e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   At each step of the way, the information collected is saved in
databases that can be used to aim ads.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent example, a quarter-million people filled out a
survey at Walt Disney Co.'s ESPN site in return for a chance to win
tickets to the NCAA Final Four tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, including The New York Times on the Web, require
users to provide their names, zip codes, age and ranges of income.
All information except the customer's name is then used to compile
profiles to help advertisers direct messages.
</P>
<P>
   In general, advertisers say that such targeting techniques can
increase as much as fivefold the percentage of viewers who click on
a given ad. The Web sites, accordingly, charge a premium for
delivering ads aimed at certain users.
</P>
<P>
   But another frontier for Internet marketers _ one that alarms
privacy advocates _ is the combining of information gathered from
people online with vast stores of data on these same people kept by
companies that compile traditional mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   Adforce Inc., a company in Cupertino, Calif., is developing a
system in cooperation with Metromail, one of the largest
mailing-list companies, to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Adforce executives are seeking to persuade Internet service
providers to give them the name and address of each visitor as he
or she surfs. Adforce would then instantly retrieve demographic and
buying-habit data kept by Metromail about that person and use it to
display advertisements aimed at him or her.
</P>
<P>
   Like Engage, Adforce says it will not provide the names and
addresses of the users to the advertiser. Charles Berger, the chief
executive of Adforce, argues that this approach is less intrusive
than the Engage system because it uses only information gathered
off line in its advertising system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my privacy is more violated if someone follows me
around and watches what I read than if they look up that I have a
Volvo in my garage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Adforce does store some of the information it collects,
Berger said neither Adforce nor Metromail planned to use the data
about which sites users view.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Internet service providers apparently have been
reluctant to sell information about their customers to Adforce. As
an alternative, the company is now asking individual sites to share
the postal addresses provided by users who register for various
services. Once a user's name and address have been captured by one
site in the Adforce network, all Metromail data about that person
would be used to select advertising on other sites in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Berger declined to say which sites had agreed to provide such
registration data.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that have chosen to take a cautious approach
is America Online, which has amassed the biggest repository of data
about its customers. After being sued by McVeigh, America Online
introduced a new, tougher privacy policy. Among other things, the
company said it would not use data about customers' online habits
to aim advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL has gone from having one of the worst records in the
industry to having one of the best privacy policies,'' said Catlett
of Junkbusters.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, however, has revenue from a regular monthly fee
charged to each user, while most other Internet services depend
entirely on advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ads aren't effective, these services are not going to
be around,'' Wetherell of CMG said.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, amid the ever greater cacophony on the Internet,
companies are increasingly desperate to find ways to reach the few
people who are likely to be receptive to their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers and publishers want a better eyeball, and a better
eyeball is a more targeted eyeball,'' said Richard Baumer, the
president of Venture Direct Worldwide. His New York-based company
sells ads on behalf of about 100 Internet sites, ranging from
Golf.com to Universal Studios. Venture Direct has agreed to
participate in the Engage system.
</P>
<P>
   Baumer argues that customers will be better off when they see
ads that are most relevant to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketers with information that use it wisely produce a better
relationship between consumer and supplier,'' he asserted. ``As in
any medium, crossing the line and abusing the information is
objectionable. This technology is potentially more useful and
potentially more harmful than we've ever seen before.''

   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration rushes to prepare new
budget requests to improve the security of U.S. embassies,
officials and experts are increasingly discussing what may be a
more efficient response to terrorism, which is retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's failure to respond to the 1996 terrorist murder by
truck bomb of 19 U.S. soldiers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, sends a
message of vulnerability by scruple, the argument goes. In other
words, America's need to find irrefutable proof of who committed an
attack before acting against the culprits may only forestall the
kind of rapid and aggressive strike that could deter further
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message being sent all over the world is that we're
vulnerable, and our allies are vulnerable,'' said Anthony Cordesman
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``That won't
be solved by more conferences and more gates, but serious thought
about how you retaliate and punish.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who is engineering another
crisis with Washington and the United Nations over inspections of
his arms programs, is hardly the only one trying to gauge America's
will.
</P>
<P>
   William Odom, who was director of counterterrorism in the Carter
White House, says he has come to a fairly simple view. ``Terrorism
at home is a crime; terrorism abroad is war.'' And if war is the
issue, he asks, ``why not act militarily?''
</P>
<P>
   While retaliation must be founded on fact, some suggest that
America's threats to retaliate to attacks like the bombing of its
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania this month lack credibility,
because U.S. standards of evidence are too high for this kind of
fight. For the war against terrorism is an increasingly irregular
war, with nihilism or cultural fury replacing political programs,
and sponsorship increasingly hidden.
</P>
<P>
   One principal suspect in the East Africa bombings, as well as in
the Dhahran attack, for example, is a renegade Saudi financier,
Osama bin Laden, who has been operating out of Afghanistan with a
fortune and a religious ideology, perhaps taking a role that states
used to take _ or shielding them from responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitri Simes, president of the Nixon Center, a Washington
policy institute, thinks there must be credible punishment for
terrorism and a lower standard of proof to trigger it. In a world
of sovereign nations, he says, ``I don't believe you need the same
level of proof as a court of law. If someone throws stones and
threatens to throw more, I don't think the level of proof has to be
too high. And if you punish the wrong guy for a particular act,
that's not even so terrible, if you know for sure that this is a
bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, looking back to humiliating excesses in Vietnam and
Central America, argue that Americans have never been particularly
good at irregular warfare, perhaps because they are so
uncomfortable with it.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's Rambo aside, Americans get skittish about granting
broad authority to the covert guys who break the rules, even to get
the bad guys. After scandals at the CIA, President Gerald R. Ford
issued an executive order in 1974 banning assassination, a
stricture that Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, now questions.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is urging both relentless
pursuit and patience. ``We are not a nation that retaliates just in
order to get vengeance,'' she told nearly 800 State Department
employees after the Africa bombings. Although ``we would all like
to go out right this instant and bomb somebody,'' she said, ``I
think that we've got to be careful about what we're doing and why
we're doing it and if we're doing the right thing so that we can be
true to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a middle ground, says Paul Goble, a former official
with the State Department and the CIA. ``If you have to make an
American legal case, it's hard to do anything. If you say no
standards are necessary, then you unleash worse problems. But you
have to prove you mean business, and even our courts require no
more than excluding reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others point to President Ronald Reagan's order to bomb
Moammar Gadhafi's residence after there was clear evidence of
Libyan complicity in attacks on U.S. soldiers in Berlin. The
then-assistant secretary of defense, Richard Perle, has said
Gadhafi understood the message and ``behaved differently for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   There are levels of deterrence, officials and experts say, and
America needs to improve its performance on all of them. Gates and
setbacks for embassies are vital, along with improved intelligence,
particularly by spies as opposed to devices, says Robert Oakley, a
former head of counterterrorism at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Even with improvements in these matters, and a steady effort to
bring terrorists to justice, argues Steven Emerson, an authority on
radical Islam, the most important element in counterterrorism is
``preemptive strikes and covert action'' to ``disrupt the
operations of the terrorists on their home turf.'' In 1996, he
noted, the Clinton administration endorsed the idea of specialized
units to infiltrate terrorist operations and disrupt them.
``Unfortunately that has not been done,'' he said.

SWISS EXPRESS RELIEF, MIXED WITH RESENTMENT, OVER HOLOCAUST
SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The front page of a leading Swiss newspaper on Friday
capsulized the country's ambivalent response to the accord this
week aimed at settling Holocaust-era claims.
</P>
<P>
   A political cartoon showed a reproduction of a Swiss bank
payment slip that listed $1.25 billion to be paid to ``The World
Jewish Congress, New York.'' The square for writing in payment
details said, ``Ah, yes: pardon from Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   An adjacent editorial in the newspaper, Le Temps, bore the
headline ``Bargaining and Politics.'' The French word
``marchandage'' in the headline can also carry the connotation of
haggling.
</P>
<P>
   The words and imagery highlighted the mix of relief and
victimization that the Swiss feel over Wednesday's announcement of
a settlement after more than two years of testy relations between
Jewish organizations, American politicians and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement _ signed by Switzerland's two largest banks, the
Union Bank of Switzerland AG and the Credit Suisse Group _ appears
to stave off serious damage to Switzerland's important banking
sector, which has been accused of profiting from dealings with the
Nazis and from the bank accounts of Jews killed in the Holocaust.
Their refusal to settle had prompted widespread threats of boycotts
of Swiss banks. Insurance companies, which face separate lawsuits,
were not covered by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But many Swiss feel it is too late to undo the damage that the
dispute has done to the country's image, its integrity and its
heroic view of its wartime history. In news media commentary around
the country, the word ``blackmail'' often cropped up, even in
articles favoring the accord.
</P>
<P>
   A national opinion poll taken immediately after the agreement
was announced found support from a slender plurality. Of the 611
people surveyed, 42 percent approved the plan while 38 percent
registered disapproval. Twenty percent said they had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have the feeling that it was not the search for
truth, but more a search for money,'' said Pascal Couchepin, the
Minister for the Economy. ``We were not accustomed to this kind of
exploration of our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the question of exactly who will pay the $1.25 billion
to Holocaust survivors seemed to ignite real worry. Many Swiss,
particularly those who lived through World War II, view any use of
taxpayer money for this purpose as an unacceptable admission of
wartime wrongdoing. This belief is combined with the fact that
Switzerland is now climbing out of its most serious recession in
decades, and has budget problems.
</P>
<P>
   Couchepin said that ``there is no reason for the Swiss
government to pay anything.'' He said that a report from a
government commission on Switzerland's dealings with the Nazis
``showed we did what was possible in the hard times of the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss National Bank, which has been singled out as a major
buyer of looted gold from Nazi Germany, was not part of the accord
and has not yet taken a position. Its spokesman, Werner Abegg, said
that the bank's governing body would have to review the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The bank already has given some $67 million to a fund set up by
Swiss banks and businesses to aid impoverished survivors of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the simmering resentment here, even enthusiasts of
the settlement peppered their remarks with comments about the
accord's amount, and the tactics used to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Nabholz, a member of Parliament, said the amount was
``quite surprising because it is hard for the average person to
understand how the small amounts uncovered in the dormant accounts
suddenly turned into $1.25 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of explaining to do,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But many people have also expressed relief that the dispute
appears to be winding down. Ms. Nabholz said that ``the situation
created a lot of frustrations and anger'' and that ``now we need
time to put soul-searching on the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the financial side settled, perhaps we can look to the
past with more serenity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Bloch, president of the Federation of Swiss Jewish
Communities, echoed the sentiment. ``I hope we can stop speaking of
money, and speak only now of the moral side,'' he said. &QL;

PRODIGAL POOCH POPS UP AFTER 14 MONTHS ON THE LAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So, where you been the last year and two months,
Bijou?
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas? Down south? Hop a freight train up the coast? Been
hanging out with some pals at the dog track? Where?
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame you can't talk, kid, because Hollywood would be
lining up for your story. The movie boys love long shots that hit,
and you just hit one of the longest. Trust me, kid, you could be
bigger than Beethoven or Air Bud.
</P>
<P>
   I talked to people who know. They say this is one for the books.
</P>
<P>
   A mutt from suburban Van Nuys with wanderlust busts out through
a kitchen window screen and hits the road in early June 1997, while
her owner is teaching night school.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Eva Zaleska, and her good friend Irene MacLean
spend the next four months haunting animal shelters, veterinary
offices, pet-supply stores, anywhere and everywhere people
congregate with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   They cruise the streets of the suburban San Fernando Valley and
stretch out their search all the way up to Ventura, in the next
county. They take out ads in all the papers and even hire people to
go door to door around your Van Nuys neighborhood, hoping somebody
took you in and failed to notice you had dog tags and a collar with
Eva's phone number on it around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. Zip. Nil. Oh, somebody did call once and said they
thought they saw you hanging out around a suburban Sherman Oaks
neighborhood, but it wasn't you. It was some other wag with
wanderlust.
</P>
<P>
   After six months or so, Eva and Irene figured the game was over.
In their hearts, they say, they never gave up. But, they'd talked
to enough people hanging around animal shelters and vet clinics to
know if you hadn't shown up by now, kid, you were probably gone
forever.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing left was to hope that wherever you went and
whoever you were with, they were giving you a good home and that
you were finally over the wanderlust that sent you packing in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Then, bingo, the phone rings a couple of weeks ago in Eva's
home. It's a woman living down south in suburban Inglewood. A
scrawny-looking dog had just wandered into her back yard, and it
was upsetting her cats. Could Eva please come and get the intruder?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is her name Bijou?'' Eva asks, standing there frozen at the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it says on her collar with your telephone
number,'' the woman says. ``Bijou.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen months after you hit the road, kid, you surfaced 40
miles south with your tags and ID still hanging around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know these women, but I'd certainly like to go to Las
Vegas with them,'' says Gary Hack, who runs the organization
Petfinders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one for the books _ unbelievable,'' he says. ``The
rule of thumb is if a dog isn't found in the first three or four
weeks, it's really tough to find them. After six weeks, almost
impossible. Fourteen months, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Animal Regulation people dealing with lost
pets I talked to said they've had dogs show up six months after
being reported missing, but 14 months? Not that anyone could
remember.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that has everybody scratching their heads, Bijou, is
where you been? If somebody took you in, they would have dumped
your old tags. If you've been wandering around the streets, how you
been surviving?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know, but she was pretty scrawny and raggedy
when we got her back,'' says Irene, who's been taking care of you,
Bijou, while Eva finishes up a long-planned vacation to Brazil
she's on this month.
</P>
<P>
   Irene says you've been eating pretty well since you got home,
kid, and that you're acting like you were never gone _ kicking back
on the couch and catching some Z's.
</P>
<P>
   And she's pretty sure you're over that wanderlust you had back
in '97 because she left the kitchen window open the other day, and
you only yawned and went back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome home, pal. Ain't no place like home, is there?
</P>

BOSS LIFTS MTA BIT BY BIT AFTER ONE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Nearly a year ago, when the MTA board put
corporate turnaround specialist Julian Burke in the driver's seat,
the multibillion-dollar transit agency was careening down a very
steep hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had been accumulating
so much debt for costly subway and light-rail projects that, if it
continued down the same track, it was going to run out of money.
The agency's reserve of credibility with state and federal
officials who control transit dollars was running on empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going into a tailspin, it seems to me,'' said Burke,
who became the MTA's interim chief executive officer on Aug. 22,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   As his one-year anniversary approaches, Burke and others say the
MTA, with his guidance, is putting the brakes on reckless spending,
refocusing attention on improving bus service and beginning to
restore its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Julian Burke stands head and shoulders above anybody
who's been in that position before,'' said David Fleming, a member
of the state Transportation Commission and a Studio City attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But no one, especially not Burke himself, claims the agency's
troubles are anywhere near over.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a chorus that mixes outright praise of Burke with
wait-and-see caution, his loudest critic remains the Bus Riders
Union.
</P>
<P>
   The bus passengers' group accuses Burke of using ``smoke and
mirrors'' to make it seem as if the MTA is complying with a federal
court order, called a consent decree, to reduce bus overcrowding
and provide better service.
</P>
<P>
   In his first stint as a public servant, Burke said he has had to
adjust from the relative privacy of company boardrooms to the
constant glare of outside attention _ but he is enjoying the
challenge of the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I'm doing even though it's taken over my life. I
wake up making decisions, and I go to sleep making decisions,'' he
said a few days ago in an interview at MTA headquarters near Union
Station. ``It's rewarding to me because I think I'm helping make
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   While he initially thought he would stay only six to eight
months _ until a permanent CEO could be recruited _ the 71-year-old
Burke now has committed to stay on until April 2000, as long as his
health permits and he feels he is contributing.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial changes have taken place at the MTA since he arrived, he
said. ``I would characterize it as substantially different than it
was a year ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said years of criticism and finger-pointing directed at
the MTA by news media, critics and lawmakers gave him ``a staff
that is quite demoralized,'' but now the agency has more ``internal
confidence that we know what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has had to get involved at a fairly low staff level
to teach employees to think differently and not fear new ideas. At
the same time, ``issues are now discussed much more precisely in
terms of what we are able to do and less what the dreams might
be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he brought folks down to reality,'' said U.S. Rep.
Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles, who keeps a close eye on regional
transportation issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan _ the MTA board chairman who lobbied the
board to bring in Burke to overhaul the agency _ credits him with
beginning to streamline operations, restructuring bus lines to
better serve customers and giving the MTA a better idea of its
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``His main accomplishment by far is getting the financial house
in order,'' Riordan said.

AS ELECTION NEARS, BOTH PARTIES ANXIOUSLY AWAIT CLINTON TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-KENDALL, CLINTON-DEPOSE.) 
(nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares for his risk-fraught
testimony before a grand jury on Monday, both political parties _
and especially the Democrats _ are warily looking for signs of how
Kenneth Starr's endgame could change the dynamics of an otherwise
placid election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's on hold until Monday,'' said Ralph Reed, a
Republican strategist, indicating how much rides politically on how
the president chooses to present himself.
</P>
<P>
   A critical question in off-year elections is voter turnout. And
a number of strategists from across the country, Democrats and
Republicans alike, said the greatest danger for Clinton's party is
that his troubles could keep disillusioned Democrats from the polls
and energize angry conservatives to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, a Republican consultant and a former senior aide to
California Gov. Pete Wilson, recalled the election of 1974, just
months after President Richard Nixon resigned in the Watergate
investigation, when the Republicans lost 43 House seats. ``After
Watergate, Republicans didn't switch sides,'' he said. ``They just
stayed home.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Secrest, a Democratic pollster for many candidates in the
South, said, ``The concern is that the president's problems could
depress Democratic turnout, and that's a legitimate concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Though far from certain about their predictions, strategists
from both parties say that there is unlikely to be an instant sharp
turn in public opinion against Clinton even if he changes from his
previous flat denial of having had ``sexual relations'' with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are still giving the president approval ratings of 60
percent or more, even as larger majorities of people tell pollsters
they think Clinton has lied about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are nervous,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic
pollster, ``but the truth is, the level of nervousness on this
issue has exceeded the level of damage by a factor of 100 to 1 so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Any Democratic hopes of making gains in the House require
Clinton's approval ratings to remain strong and for him to rise
above the scandal and amplify the party's campaign themes in the
critical months of September and October.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, a number of Democrats, searching for a way to
put the controversy behind them, say that Clinton should move
swiftly after Monday's closed-circuit testimony before the grand
jury and speak directly to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point some communication with the American people is
necessary to write the final chapter,'' said Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J. ``There is not closure until at some point the
president makes a final statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now think that the controversy is likely to cement
their hold on the House and enlarge their majority. But Republicans
acknowledge that they, too, face risks if they cause a national
backlash by appearing too partisan in handling an impeachment
report.
</P>
<P>
   They also say they cannot skate too much on Clinton's troubles
without putting forth a compelling agenda. And they are waiting to
see whether Clinton, always a resilient politician, chooses to
deliver a speech of apology and ask for the country's
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties, much will ride on how women, in particular,
react to whatever revelations emerge. Dianne Bystron, the director
of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa
State University, said various polls this summer had put Democrats
up 10 to 14 points among women, and Republicans up 9 to 13 points
among men.
</P>
<P>
   That means Democrats would be in great danger if women become
disaffected and stay home in November. ``Democrats have to be
concerned,'' Ms. Bystron said. ``As in 1996, they have to change
the discourse from personal behavior to issues affecting the
family. The Democrats have to make sure that women show up at the
polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidates have inveighed against the
moral tone Clinton has set, but the Lewinsky controversy has so far
been raised in few of this year's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Massey, who recently won a Republican primary for a
Congressional seat in Tennessee, handed out fliers calling the
Clinton White House the ``scandal-a-day administration'' and
mentioning ``Monica'' in large print.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been the exception. Speaker Newt Gingrich counseled
House Republicans heading home for the Congressional vacation to
say nothing after Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, for their part, are not fleeing Clinton as they did
in 1994, the year the Republicans swept to control of Congress.
Just this week, Clinton raised $3 million for Lt. Gov. Gray Davis,
the Democratic nominee for governor in California, who spent nearly
two days basking at the president's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here feel pretty good about the president,'' said Bill
Carrick, a Los Angeles Democratic consultant who oversaw Clinton's
state operation in 1996. ``What you see in focus groups is the same
thing you see in polls nationally. People feel good about the
president and the the job he's doing. They don't have much interest
in talking in any great degree about Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic strategist close to the Congressional Democratic
leadership said: ``Our candidates are not being asked about this by
local press. That's encouraging. That's one of the reasons why
we're not in a total state of panic. The public's largely tuned out
at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats argue that the unfolding situation could yet
backfire against the Republicans if they look too partisan in
pursuit of impeachment hearings once Starr _ as is now expected _
reports to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the Starr report deals only with the Lewinsky
matter and suffers from overreach and a continuing lack of
perspective that has characterized the Starr investigation, it is
fraught with danger for the Republicans,'' Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., who is helping with the House
Republican re-election effort, conceded that if the party began
tearing into Starr's report before November ``it could have the
potential of coming back to bite us.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he did not expect Republicans to begin any possible
impeachment hearings before November. ``The calendar doesn't allow
that, and I don't think the leaders of the Congress will allow that
to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Republicans, he said his party would be protected by
the stature of Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who as chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee would preside over impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   As both parties plan their final campaign appeals, they are
starting to factor in a Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a lot of people arguing, `Is this election about the
do-nothing Congress or the Lewinsky matter?''' Torricelli said.
``It's about the nexus between the two,'' he said, contending that
Republicans had put their energy into investigations instead of
passing legislation on tobacco, health maintenance organizations
and education.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said that rather than attacking Clinton
head-on, they could subtly capitalize on the idea that he was
untrustworthy and needed to be held in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help to publicly bash Clinton,'' said Beth Smith,
executive director of the Nebraska Republican Party. ``People know
the probability they will be stuck with him for another two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   That, she said, argued for Republicans to return to the theme
that emerged late in 1996 when they conceded Bob Dole's defeat but
said a Republican Congress was needed to rein in Clinton's power
and ideological leanings. &QL;

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ With the outside world doing little to
stop them, heavily armed Serbian policemen backed by Yugoslav army
soldiers are stepping up their terror against ethnic Albanian
civilians in Kosovo, driving tens of thousands from their homes and
shelling, looting and burning their villages.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one village in southern Kosovo, the police are
demolishing brick homes that survived being set afire. In a village
nearby, the police told residents that they must surrender any
weapons they had or their homes would be burned to the ground,
according to villagers and the local Roman Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   While the government asserts that it destroys homes only if
combat conditions make this inevitable, foreign diplomats say the
Serbs obviously hope to clear ethnic Albanian supporters of the
armed rebels from vast areas of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the International Red Cross, which helps oversee
the Geneva Conventions protecting civilians in war, said Saturday
that they were debating whether the forces of the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, were violating the conventions by
displacing villagers and then destroying their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments have threatened to use NATO's might to stop
what some foreign diplomats here have called a war against
civilians. NATO says it is weighing its response, and this weekend
the German defense minister, Volker Ruehe, spoke out strongly in
favor of a strike against Yugoslav forces even if the Serbs'
traditional Slav Orthodox ally, Russia, objects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government is strengthening its grip on Kosovo,
and civilian misery abounds.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies estimate that up to 200,000 civilians have fled
their homes since the government began a military offensive against
ethnic Albanian rebels on July 19. The rebels had seized control of
large parts of Kosovo in their bid to make the Serbian-ruled
province an independent country.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees are still living in the open. Foreign relief
workers report that many of them, especially the elderly and the
young, are growing increasingly weak and suffering from disease.
</P>
<P>
   But most reject the government's urgings to return home, either
because they fear police or army attacks or because their homes
have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies say they were overwhelmed by the number of
refugees and cannot do enough to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the village of Novo Selo in southern Kosovo say the
police have given them until Monday to turn over any weapons or see
their homes destroyed. The village priest, the Rev. Frane Kola,
said that he had told the police there were no hidden weapons and
had invited them to search the homes, but that the police had
insisted weapons be surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not, they say they will surround the village and burn the
buildings,'' Kola said.
</P>
<P>
   Pervua Marku, the village mechanic, said: ``They will do it.
Look at all the other places they are destroying.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby village of Priljep, where residents have fled and
where officials say the police have been in control for many days,
a police bunker with a heavy machine gun overlooked the smoldering
roofs of brick homes. In the streets, policemen with assault rifles
were on patrol and a bulldozer was leveling what the flames could
not destroy.
</P>
<P>
   With its offensive, the government has regained control of major
roads and pushed rebel fighters from many areas. The main ethnic
Albanian political party says 159 villages and hamlets that were
controlled by the rebels are now back under government authority,
but most of the residents have fled. Once civilians leave an area,
the police often loot and then burn homes, farms and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   By conventional military standards the rebels, who call
themselves the Kosovo Liberation Army, have been very badly hurt by
the government attacks. Before the offensive, rebel forces
controlled as much as 40 percent of the province. Their support had
swelled dramatically since a fierce police crackdown in March.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel soldiers serenely patrolled major roads almost in sight of
government positions and there was a virtual rebel government in
some regions. Rebel commanders and many ethnic Albanians were
euphoric, predicting the imminent fall of major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Now government officials contend that the rebels have been
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a conventional war, or even standard guerrilla
warfare, because the Kosovo Liberation Army is not nearly as much a
military force as it is a movement. It may not be properly trained,
or commanded by military professionals, but it may not have to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a guerrilla war; it is a peasant uprising,'' said
Shkelzen Maliqi, an ethnic Albanian political leader and author.
``It is a movement which doesn't have the weapons to fight
government forces. But this is a secessionist movement which cannot
be stopped.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By what can be measured on a map alone, the Kosovo Liberation
Army is reeling, and some commanders admit it. In a remote village
filled with newly created refugees, where water, medicine and food
were all scarce, a top commander refused to say how badly his
forces were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about that, because the truth would
damage my people,'' he said, insisting that his name and location
not be revealed. Government forces were preparing to advance on the
village and some rebel soldiers in the area seemed in a near panic.
</P>
<P>
   On the roads traversing areas that rebels had claimed as theirs,
the government controls all traffic and is running convoys of
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   A regional commander of the rebels' special forces, Sabit Geti,
was tearing along mountain ridges on rutted trails last week, going
between rebel positions. He reclined in the passenger seat of a
car, his right leg held straight by a thick, bloody bandage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they are hurting us,'' he said. ``They have artillery and
tanks, and we have only this,'' he added, holding up the assault
rifle next to him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was able to use back roads to get easily into the
northern Kosovo city of Mitrovica, obtain medical care and return
to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign military experts say that the government's offensive has
stopped the extraordinary rise in the rebels' military progress but
has not changed the fundamental equation, which will keep the war
going unless there is a negotiated peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a single fact that controls this conflict: 90 percent
of the people here are either supporters or potential supporters of
the rebels,'' said a foreign military expert, referring to Kosovo's
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population. ``No government can
defeat that, and this government, with its tactics, is only making
the rebels politically stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the roads that government forces now hold, soldiers and
police man a network of bunkers, machine-gun emplacements and
trenches, many of which are surrounded by growing piles of
discarded beer bottles and food containers.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, however, ethnic Albanian forces that have been
shoved back from the roads and cleared from the now empty villages
still dominate the rugged rural terrain. There are rebel positions
within a mile of Priljep, where the police are demolishing homes.
</P>
<P>
   With the forces facing off in this way, military experts say the
next move could be conclusive. For now, it appears that neither
side has a decisive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have a good picture of how organized or cohesive
the KLA was before the offensive, and it is a lot murkier now,''
said a European diplomat, referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
``But they look very confused. They may not be able to convert
hatred of the government into effective military action for a very
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic faces risks, too. While government officials wait
to see how the rebels react to the offensive, thousands of troops
must be kept in the field. That costs a lot, and Milosevic's men
are short of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with these long, exposed, supply lines running
everywhere, we'll see how well Belgrade can keep its people in
beans and bullets,'' a foreign diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Another diplomat said: ``I believe that simply keeping the
troops in the field will bankrupt the government quickly. It has
only a pittance in cash reserves, it can't pay salaries for
teachers and hospital workers and it has almost no revenues.''

FORMER IRON CURTAIN LAWYER CLEARED OF BLACKMAIL CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ For 25 years during the Cold War, Wolfgang Vogel
swapped spies and traded political prisoners from a law office in
East Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   A confidant of leaders in East and West Germany, Vogel was
trusted by the CIA as well as the KGB, earning a reputation as a
humanitarian for enabling 250,000 East Germans to get to freedom in
the West and becoming one of the communist world's few millionaires
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But his world turned upside down after the Berlin wall fell in
1989. A few former clients complained he had swindled them, and
after unification in 1990 German prosecutors agreed, asserting that
his law practice had been just a Communist Party secret-police scam
to press his fellow citizens to give up their houses and property
at fire-sale prices in exchange for permission to leave East
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, a state court in Berlin found him guilty on
five counts of blackmail. He appealed the convictions, and the same
court acquitted him of 32 similar charges later the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vogel, 73, has his good name back. Germany's highest court
found in his favor on two of the appealed cases and announced this
week that prosecutors had agreed to drop the others.
</P>
<P>
   He and his lawyers say they expect that next week a Berlin tax
court will drop parallel charges of evading $5.6 million in taxes
on money the West German authorities paid him for arranging secret
prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some mistakes, I admit that,'' Vogel said in a
telephone interview from the Bavarian Alps, where he and his wife
and longtime assistant, Helga, have retired. ``But dropping the
charges of blackmail removes the stain on my reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all his critics see it that way. As part of the bargaining
that settled the criminal cases after a high-court decision that
removed the linchpin of the prosecution's case, he and his lawyers
agreed not to contest another conviction two years ago for perjury
and falsely swearing in notarized statements.
</P>
<P>
   That conviction stands, with a suspended 14-month jail sentence
and a $65,700 fine, so it would be impossible for Vogel to practice
law again even if he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never should have said I was in my office on the day the
statement was sworn _ I forgot I was in Israel trying to negotiate
a prisoner swap, and now I have to take the consequences,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his unique role ended when the Iron Curtain came down.
Freedom threw a harsh new light on activities that, by common
consent of his former clients and fellow negotiators _ West Germans
as well as East Germans, Americans as well as Russians _ had long
been left in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Unification also highlighted the differences that 45 years of
division had created between the 16 million East Germans and their
more fortunate 64 million West German compatriots.
</P>
<P>
   In the freedom they have all enjoyed since 1990, some Germans on
both sides forgot that communism had institutionalized blackmail;
it was not a system of courts and laws like the one that, at first,
recast Vogel as an unethical lawyer and imprisoned him for more
than six months on the tax charges in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came April 12, when a Leipzig panel of the
Bundesgerichtshof, Germany's highest court, found in a case
involving one of Vogel's associates that what Vogel had been
pleading all along was true.
</P>
<P>
   It had been state policy in East Germany, the court said, to
require people who wanted to leave for the West to sell or give
away their property before they could get permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolfgang Vogel could retain influence and succeed in
emigration cases only if he observed the rules'' set by the East
German government, the court ruled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Therefore, telling his clients that they had to sell their
property before they could get out did not constitute blackmail _
even if he then bought the property himself at prices lower than
the assessed values.
</P>
<P>
   This removed the grounds for his 1996 blackmail conviction for
getting Vera and Waldemar Zapff, East German clients in 1980, to
sell their property to Vogel and a Communist secret-police colonel.
This summer, prosecutors agreed to drop that case and the other
convictions Vogel had appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's out of it,'' said one of Vogel's longest-lasting
negotiating partners, Francis Meehan, a retired U.S. ambassador who
first met him in 1962. Vogel emerged then as the lawyer for a
Russian spy convicted in New York, Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, and
helped arrange his exchange that year for Francis Gary Powers, the
American U-2 pilot who had been captured by the Russians in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan was also present at the last big spy swap, the release of
the Soviet dissident Anatoly Shcharansky, who as Natan Sharansky is
now a Cabinet minister in the Israeli government, and eight
imprisoned spies in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Vogel was doing was immensely useful to both sides,''
Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Ziegler, one of Vogel's lawyers, said his client would
not try to claim damages for his six-month imprisonment. ``We
wanted to call an end to a nine-year ordeal,'' he said.

<P>
   At the age of 7, a child is considered by the Roman Catholic
Church to have reached the ``age of reason'' and is entitled to
receive communion. Some evangelical churches hold that a child of 7
can make an independent spiritual choice.
</P>
<P>
   In Judaism and Islam, a boy of 7 is expected to begin his
religious studies and participate, to some degree, in adult rituals
like fasting and praying. Freud believed the super ego, or the
conscience, develops by age 4 or 5.
</P>
<P>
   But is a child of such tender years a responsible being, capable
of telling right from wrong and accountable, not just legally but
morally, for his actions?
</P>
<P>
   Murder charges brought last week in Chicago against two boys,
ages 7 and 8, raised the issue as more than an abstraction. The
boys, according to the police, confessed to killing an 11-year-old
girl, Ryan Harris, then stealing her bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters kill _ that's been drilled into the national
consciousness by a succession of school shootings. In those cases,
the juvenile killers were adolescents. The two boys who were
convicted last week of gunning down classmates and a teacher in
their Jonesboro, Ark., schoolyard last March were then just 11 and
13. The boy charged in the school shootings in Springfield, Ore.,
last May is 15. Few would argue with the assumption that, at that
stage in their lives, they ought to be capable of understanding
their actions and the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   With a child of only 7, however, the assumptions are neither
clear nor particularly comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with children who may have arrived at the age
of reason but whose psychological life is such that neither
rationality nor moral reason operate in their behavior?'' asked Dr.
Robert Coles, a child psychiatrist at Harvard University who has
written several books on the moral development of children.
</P>
<P>
   No one, he said, is born bad. Yet, despite a lifetime of
studying and listening to children, he was utterly confounded by
the implications of the Chicago case. ``In the absence of that kind
of psychological life _ I mean the lack of controls to deal with
the impulses of their lives, the lack of an operative consciousness
_ I can only throw up my hands,'' Coles said.
</P>
<P>
   How society will deal with the boys is now a question for the
juvenile justice system, but there are no precedents; they are the
youngest children ever charged with murder in this country.
Thursday, they were released to their mothers and ordered to wear
electronic monitoring devices and stay in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Religion, a source of society's notions of justice, has been
wrestling with moral codes for millennia. But cases of children
committing capital crimes are rare, so they represent something of
a black hole for theologians, a puzzle that neither faith nor
doctrine anticipates.
</P>
<P>
   Both Judaism and Islam, for example, set the age of majority,
when children are liable for their actions, at 13 for boys and 12
for girls. ``It's the age of full responsibility and therefore full
liability,'' said Dr. David Kraemer, a professor at the Jewish
Theological Seminary. Younger children are considered to have the
impulse to do good and evil, he added, ``but not the reason to
control the impulse.''
</P>
<P>
   One rabbinic teaching goes further. While rabbinical courts
consider a 13-year-old liable for his actions, in the court of
heaven the age of majority is 20. ``It was a recognition that the
teen-age years were very tumultuous and that, although they are
full-grown and can do damage, God recognizes that they can't really
be held responsible,'' Kraemer said.
</P>
<P>
   Islam, too, holds that a prepubescent child is not ``fully in
control of his senses and doesn't have the power of reasoning to
really make an informed judgment,'' said Dr. Jamal Badawi, a Muslim
scholar and chairman of the Islamic Information Foundation in
Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither religion has a concept of original sin. ``The human
being is neither satanic nor angelic by nature,'' said Badawi,
referring to the Koran. ``He simply has the potential to ascend to
a level even higher than the angels or descend to a level lower
than animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian theology on the nature of the child is more complex,
encompassing a belief that everyone is tainted by original sin as
well as accommodating the idea that everyone is made in the image
of God.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of Pope Pius X nearly a century ago, the Catholic
Church has attributed to children of 7 the capacity to understand
the consequences of their actions. That is a prerequisite for their
First Communion, when they are first given a wafer in the sacrament
of the Eucharist. But strict doctrine has given way to pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the context,'' said the Rev. Richard
McCormick, a theologian at the University of Notre Dame. ``One of
the criteria used in regard to the Eucharist is the ability to
understand, in some very, very primordial sense, the difference
between just plain bread and this bread that is really Jesus. As we
all grow older, we understand and penetrate that a bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   But children who may be old enough to take communion, he added,
are not necessarily thought of as capable of understanding the
nature of sin as a break with God. ``It's the conviction of
virtually all people that children of that age are incapable of
serious sin,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas about the emergence of moral consciousness developed
differently in Protestant churches. The Calvinist view was that
``the image of God in each of us is radically destroyed or altered
by what is called original sin, that there is innate depravity in
human beings,'' said John McDargh, an associate professor of
theology at Boston College. Other Christian thinkers, he said,
argued that the image of God should be seen as the human capacity
for relationships and that original sin may obscure but not destroy
that image.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, those divergent views produced not only
the image of ``The Bad Seed,'' as popularized in William March's
1954 novel about a child who is simply born bad, but also the early
Puritan notion that adults should deploy a harsh hand to break the
will of the innately corrupted child.
</P>
<P>
   Later movements, in a backlash, leaned more toward the Mark
Twain view that the natural child, like the fictional Huckleberry
Finn, is untainted except by society, and prescribed a lighter
parental touch to nurture what was believed to be the child's
innate capacity for empathy and charity.
</P>
<P>
   Modern theorists of child development see children much as
parents like to think of their offspring _ works in progress, with
natural inclinations to empathize with others, to feel bad if
someone is hurt, to tell right from wrong. The tricky part is
figuring out how and when those values can be warped or enhanced by
interactions with family, peers and society.
</P>
<P>
   By an early age, any child will be tested. ``When you send a
child off to school at 6, the child becomes a social being,
responsible to society,'' said Coles, the child psychiatrist. And
that's where the danger lies. ``Children who grow up with no sense
of right and wrong are both vulnerable and dangerous _ vulnerable
to their impulses, dangerous to others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reason, then, is not really the issue with a child of 7 or 8.
``It's not like a 4-year-old who happens to pull a trigger on a gun
and doesn't understand that it kills, or doesn't understand what
killing is about altogether, or what death is about,'' said Dr.
Moshe Halbertal, a professor of Jewish thought at Hebrew University
in Jerusalem. ``Here, at 7 or 8 or 9, they understand. We don't
attribute to them responsibility, but we do attribute to them
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   And by their very nature, he added, children bounce the question
back to their elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say that children are not fully legally responsible,
one thing we mean by that is that they mirror the social life
around them,'' Halbertal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what's so shattering about crimes done by children.
They are naive or, in some ways, transparent reflections of
something in society _ a certain violence, a certain cruelty.
Without filtering, they represent what the society is about.''

VEHICLE DEBRIS OFFERS CLUES IN TANZANIA BOMB ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ Investigators have found parts of a
vehicle that they believe probably carried the bomb that exploded
at the U.S. Embassy here, American officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The parts were found in material excavated from the crater where
the bomb exploded just outside the embassy gates eight days ago,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There were indications that the investigators know from
preliminary tests what kind of vehicle the bomb was attached to,
but they declined to describe it specifically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no information that would definitively identify any
vehicle,'' said Kenneth Piernick, the special assistant agent in
charge of the FBI's Washington field office, who is directing the
investigation here.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials in Washington said they believed the vehicle
may have been a delivery truck whose driver tried to rush the gate
of the embassy and get past the security guards.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the case, the modus operandi of delivering the bomb
in Dar es Salaam appears to have been similar to that in Nairobi,
Kenya, where security guards have told investigators that a pickup
truck, commonly used for deliveries, carried the explosives in the
attack on the U.S. Embassy there.
</P>
<P>
   In the attack in Tanzania, the five security guards posted at
the embassy gates were killed in the explosion, apparently leaving
the investigators without nearby witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents have begun interviewing Tanzanian employees of the
embassy and others about whom they saw outside the embassy building
and whether they noticed a strange car in the period before the
blast, which killed 10 people and wounded more than 70.
</P>
<P>
   But here the investigators _ bomb experts, laboratory
technicians and others armed with long sticks who are prodding the
charred ground around the embassy building _ have a big advantage
over their counterparts in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   For gathering physical evidence, Piernick said, the site, which
is more suburban than urban, was nearly perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted with the conditions,'' he said. There was
virtually no looting of the embassy grounds after the attack, and
because the rescue operation was relatively simple, the evidence
was not moved or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators here remained guarded about what they had
found, they seemed relatively happy with their preliminary results.
A portable laboratory was testing for DNA material, among other
things, a U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have had nothing to say about what kind of
explosive was used in the bomb. Piernick dismissed as ``gross
speculation'' a report that it consisted of ammonium nitrate.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been reports that the explosive used in the
Nairobi bombing was ammonium nitrate. But an explosives expert
there, Capt. Ryle Jones of the British army, said that these early
suspicions of ammonium nitrate were based on searchers having found
a piece of plastic with a crystallized substance on it.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the plastic came from the lamination between
the embassy's window panes and that the residue was the shattered
glass, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the amount of damage caused by the explosion in Nairobi,
there was little doubt that a commercially manufactured explosive
was used, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Tanzanian police said Saturday that they had released all
but two of the 14 people they arrested soon after the attack. U.S.
officials have suggested they did not believe that any of those
arrested, who included six Sudanese and six Iraqis, were suspects
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans have gone out of their way to stress the
cooperation they are receiving from Tanzania. The investigative
abilities of the police here are severely limited because of lack
of money and poor training.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and other U.S. agencies have flown in huge amounts of
equipment as well as more than 100 people ranging from
administrators to interviewers to technical specialists.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the Tanzanians continue to give the Americans the
leeway to conduct the investigation in the way they want, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright will visit government officials and the
bomb site Tuesday. She will also go to Nairobi.

 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall,
has practically moved into the White House, prepping his client in
sessions at all hours in the days before Clinton tells a grand jury
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. As chief architect of
Clinton's legal strategy, it is Kendall who will be at the
president's side as he testifies on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   And like his client, Kendall has his reputation on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some Clinton loyalists are questioning whether the
tight-lipped, take-no-prisoners attitude favored by Kendall's firm,
Williams &AMP; Connolly, was the smartest approach in a case that so
obviously required a public relations offensive as much as a legal
solution.
</P>
<P>
   For seven months, Kendall, along with other lawyers, including
Hillary Rodham Clinton, has insisted that Clinton's team stick to
the basic script of saying nothing and denying everything while
fighting Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, on every front,
Clinton advisers have said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton is considering a strategy of acknowledging that he
had intimate sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, senior advisers
have said. He is also weighing making a public statement, a gambit
that Kendall has opposed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall has quickly become a lightning rod for Clinton
supporters critical of the handling of the case. Kendall said he
would not respond to the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may well repeat his original account of ``no improper
relationship'' with Ms. Lewinsky. If, however, he tells the grand
jury that he did have a sexual relationship with her and that his
previous denials were based on a narrow definition of sexual
relations, the president might avoid a perjury charge _ but he
could also come under considerable fire for having been technically
truthful but not fundamentally honest with the public. And if that
happens, Kendall would almost certainly take a large share of the
blame for any political fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall would risk disbarment if Clinton tells the grand jury
anything that his lawyer knows to be false and Kendall does not
immediately withdraw from the case. This predicament is highly
unusual in a grand jury proceeding, since lawyers are not generally
allowed to accompany their clients when they testify.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kendall could emerge as a legal genius if Clinton
survives the scandal more or less intact. And a number of friends
said that either way, despite his gentlemanly reserve, Kendall is
equipped to handle both the pressures now and any possible
repercussions later.
</P>
<P>
   ``You constantly have this profile of him as this Quaker choir
boy but he's a street fighter,'' said Steve Coz, editor of The
National Enquirer and a client of Kendall's for 15 years. ``He's a
polished version of James Carville.'' Carville is a Clinton ally
famous for his dead-on, no-holds-barred attacks in defense of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's other private lawyer, Robert Bennett, who
represented Clinton in the civil sexual harassment suit brought by
Paula Corbin Jones, was also widely criticized for his handling of
the assignment _ right up until the day a federal judge in Little
Rock granted Bennett's motion and threw out the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall is seen as gentler and more genteel than Bennett, the
legal slugger with whom he is constantly compared. By contrast,
Kendall is considered rather prim, less prepared to get messy,
legally or any other way. And despite his First Amendment work,
Kendall is much less willing to mix it up with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did go after Starr over news leaks, Kendall
generally sticks to his white-shoe firm's more traditional view
that cases are best tried in the courtroom. Bennett, on the other
hand, considers public advocacy part of his job, and deals with
questions both political and legal.
</P>
<P>
   On this case in particular, Kendall's close-to-the-vest behavior
has been criticized at various times. Many on the White House staff
were openly furious to have been left out of the loop about the
recent news that the president was subpoenaed in the Lewinsky
matter, and they blamed Kendall for not informing them of such an
important development.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kendall has worked for the president since 1993, when he
was brought in on the Whitewater case. He has lasted longer than
most of those on Clinton's current roster of advisers and has
weathered in-house criticism in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Though a number of Kendall's friends at Yale Law do not remember
him being especially close to the Clintons there, he is considered
a particular favorite of the first lady, with whom he seems to
share a dim view of unnecessary sharing with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A Quaker raised in the small town of Sheridan, Ind., David
Kendall's favorite childhood places were the local library and the
movie theater, where he and his grandfather would catch a double
feature just about every Saturday afternoon. Books _ Dickens, best
sellers and military histories _ and movies, from science fiction
to art films, have remained lifelong passions.
</P>

   He is married to Anne Laybourne Kendall, a psychologist who does
educational testing of children, and they have three children, the
youngest of whom is a senior at Sidwell Friends, where Chelsea
Clinton went to high school and Kendall is a former chairman of the
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Now 54, he has turned into the sort of man who not only can
quote Yeats, but does. And even friends say his humor can be a
little rarefied, tending toward word play or elaborate practical
jokes, like sneaking off a plane during an unscheduled stop to give
a sleeping, slightly hung-over colleague who awoke next to an empty
seat at the final destination the impression that Kendall had
somehow fallen out of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can reasonably question his mental toughness; and the
pertinent question is not whether Kendall knows how to fight but
whether this particular battle is one he can win.

   He was arrested 10 times while working in Mississippi during the
civil rights movement. After a Rhodes scholarship, Yale Law and a
Supreme Court clerkship with Justice Byron White, he spent five
years working on death penalty cases at the NAACP's Legal Defense
and Education Fund Inc. Since joining Williams &AMP; Connolly in 1978,
his First Amendment work has frequently required a strong stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Coz recalls a time back in 1987 when The National Enquirer was
about to publish its scoop of the week: ``Liberace's Secret Battle
with AIDS.'' On deadline, the tabloid's editors were nervous and
inclined to kill the story, worrying that if they were wrong,
Liberace would, quite literally, end up owning the place. Finally,
Kendall, who had vetted the piece, stood up at the meeting and
ended the debate. ``Go with it,'' he said. ``You have it.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at that Liberace cover, which also touts such stories as
``Expert Reveals Six Tips to Help You Get a Raise,'' ``Connie
Francis: I'm Singing Again and I Feel Like a Million,'' and ``Fact
About Colds That Will Surprise You'' is an almost poignant reminder
of the days before allegations of the president's Oval Office
assignations dominated not only tabloid but also mainstream news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never looks ecstatic and he never looks beleaguered _ he
always just looks like David,'' said Carville, the Clinton ally,
who did a double take when he ran into Kendall at the airport, en
route to a family getaway to Canada, on the Friday afternoon that
Clinton's subpoena was disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those who have been critical of Kendall's approach
allow that he does not seem to have taken on a particularly easy
case, from either a legal or a public relations standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Kendall does not have a particularly pliable
client in Clinton, whose own fine legal mind sometimes rejects his
lawyers' strategy. And no one in Clinton's tiny inner circle is
saying exactly how much of Kendall's advice the president has
actually accepted. &QL;

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ The United States, Britain, France and other
Western nations began a hurried final evacuation of their citizens
from this city on Saturday amid signs that African-led negotiations
to prevent a rebel assault on the capital would fail.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon Saturday, the U.S. Embassy, already
operating with only a skeleton staff, told Americans remaining in
Kinshasa that they had only about two hours to register for a final
flight out that afternoon. The embassy itself, officials said,
would be closing due to the heightened security risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the post-ultimate evacuation,'' said a senior official
at the embassy, who added that as recently as Friday night American
officials had expected to remain in the country. Instead,
Washington sent evacuation orders for the last 20 embassy staff
members early Saturday morning, suggesting, the official said, that
information about a growing risk for foreigners had been received
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   At the French Embassy, which built a protective barrier of
sandbags around its entrance on Friday in expectation of violence,
several dozen pro-government demonstrators denounced the West for
what they called its support of the rebels, and jeered France in
particular, urging its citizens to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, another anti-Western group marched down the city's
main boulevard, turning angry when it reached one of the two
international hotels, where many foreign journalists are staying.
The crowd accosted several reporters, and soldiers entered the
hotel briefly in what they said was a search for illegal equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to chanting against Westerners, demonstrators again
denounced Rwanda, which is vehemently blamed both in the streets
and in official propaganda for sponsoring the rebels and, indeed,
for all of Congo's recent problems. Rwandans and Congolese
suspected of Rwandan ancestry have disappeared from this city since
the war began, many of them rounded up by security forces and
interned at a military camp in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all this, for a city facing what is expected to be a
rebel siege, Kinshasa was otherwise unusually calm here for the
second straight day on Saturday, with few signs of unusual military
activity and little sense of panic among ordinary citizens. Instead
there were many bitter complaints about being kept in the dark on
the direction of the war.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks now, Congo's president for the last 15 months,
Laurent Kabila, has been fighting for his political life against an
armed rebellion. It sprouted abruptly near the Rwandan border and
spread quickly to the strategically vital far west, near Kinshasa,
through the use of audacious tactics and, apparently, careful
planning.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's prolonged absence from the capital has caused many in
Kinshasa to suggest that if the battle for the capital were lost,
he could continue the war from Lubumbashi, capital of his southern
homeland. If this were to happen, many commentators here have
speculated, Congo's breakup _ forever cited as a risk _ might
finally begin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the last several days, the rebels have broken out of
defensive positions near the western towns of Moanda, Kitona and
Banana, and claim to have seized total or partial control of the
major cities of Boma and Matadi, as well as of the huge Inga dam,
which supplies this country and much of the region with electrical
power.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest rebel claims, which are credited by
Western diplomats, the insurgents are advancing toward the capital
from positions less than 200 miles southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In response the government has denied losing control of any new
cities, and claimed Friday to have begun a bombardment campaign
against the rebels' principal western base, a captured army
training center at Kitona. A variety of people, from government
officials to foreign business people here, said that whatever the
truth, there was intense combat in the Matadi area since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't fear anything,'' said Didier Mumengi, the information
minister. Other officials indicated that Kabila was meeting with
his war Cabinet in Lubumbashi and might address the nation Saturday
evening. Control of Lubumbashi, which dominates the mouth of the
Congo River, is widely viewed as critical to holding Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Though ill prepared and often poorly commanded, government
troops are reportedly well armed and often motivated, and have
repeatedly rebounded from dramatic setbacks to mount
counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
   One possible reason for the relative calm here, even as
Westerners expecting the worst quit the city, is that with their
country's tumultuous history Kinshasans have experience of crises
like this. In fact, for many here the events of August give the
almost hallucinatory feeling of watching last year's history as if
rewound on tape and played back at fast-forward. At that time
Kabila was leading a rebellion sponsored by Rwanda, which took
seven months to overthrow the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen all of this before with the fall of Mobutu,''
said Kibamba Lukoki, a Kinshasa newspaper vendor. ``Our fear is
less about the moment, which is serious enough, but familiar. Our
real fear is that our country, Congo, has fallen into a cycle from
which it won't be able to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   For now Kabila is cloistered in Lubumbashi, just as Mobutu, then
dying of cancer, spent much of the last war either in his native
far-northern city of Gbadolite or in Switzerland. Just as Mobutu
did in his final years, Kabila, in the second half of his brief
rule, has concentrated authority in the hands of ethnic kinsmen and
close relatives. And finally, just like the dictator he overthrew,
Kabila seemed to realize only late in the rebellion that he needed
to replace an ineffective army leader _ his brother-in-law Celestin
Kifwa, who it seems was chosen essentially out of personal trust.
</P>
<P>
   Until late in Mobutu's failed war, his entire general staff was
dominated by corrupt relatives. Kabila, in a twist not even
attempted by his predecessor, last week replaced Kifwa as chief of
staff with his son, Joseph Kabila, who has just returned from a
hasty course of military training in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila was given power on a golden platter by the Rwandans,''
said one senior officer from Mobutu's army who has been placed in
reserve by the new government. ``Now he is losing it in the same
way Mobutu did. He is trying to implement the same failed system
that he supposedly came to sweep away.''

CHILEAN INDIANS DIVIDED OVER A RIVER, AND THEIR FATE

   RALCO, Chile _ While the Spanish conquistadors vanquished the
Incas and Aztecs with relative ease, the Mapuche Indians of Chile
staved off the invaders for generations with ferocious hit-and-run
attacks. The Spanish rarely dared to cross the deep, rushing waters
of the Bio-Bio River, which served as a tense barricade well into
the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Mapuches are a faint shadow of their mighty ancestors,
but once again they are making a stand on the Bio-Bio.
</P>
<P>
   The government and Endesa, a Spanish-owned electric utility,
want to build a $500 million dam project on the river intended to
provide more than 10 percent of Chile's electricity by 2002. But a
dozen Indian families have refused to leave their lands, which
would be flooded by the dam. Their militancy has provoked
demonstrations and road blockades around the country, embarrassed
President Eduardo Frei and put the entire hydroelectric project in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   After years of lost Indian land battles during the dictatorship
of Augusto Pinochet, the conflict has become a test for Indian
minority rights in Chile's decade-old democracy, one that may take
years to resolve in the courts. But the issue has also highlighted
two divergent views of what the future of Indian life should be:
one based on traditional ways of living, and one that favors
economic development at the risk of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is sharply dividing the impoverished farming and
herding community of 500 Pehuenche Indians _ a subgroup in the
Mapuche nation _ that sprawls below a breathtaking swath of
snow-capped Andean mountains. Faced with an Endesa offer to leave
their lands in exchange for a package of new land, housing, a
school and credits, the holdouts are opposed by about 90 Pehuenche
families who have agreed to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will mean a new day for us,'' said Maria Olga Galpan, 26, a
goatherd who is ready to leave Ralco. ``We want to keep our
traditions but this land is good for nothing. We need new schools,
new houses, new opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But a minority in the community will not budge because, they
say, the 1,000-acre reservoir the 570-megawatt project would create
would flood traditional burial grounds and other plots where the
Pehuenches conduct their religious rituals under sacred trees. They
say several herbs the Pehuenches depend on for medicine do not grow
on the lands offered by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born on this land and I want to die on this land,'' said
Nicolasa Quintreman Qulpan, 59, a leader of the Indians who oppose
the project. ``How can I abandon my grandparents and
great-grandparents?''
</P>
<P>
   The two groups accuse each other of being manipulated by
outsiders, either by the Spanish electric company or by Chilean and
foreign environmentalists who say the dam will upset a precious
ecosystem and doom several exotic species of fish that are found
nowhere else in the world. A couple of fistfights have broken out
over the dam in Ralco, says one Chilean environmentalist who
follows the issue, but mostly members of the two groups exchange
frosty stares when they meet on the dirt paths that crisscross the
riverside community.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle has taken on national proportions, including a
three-day protest march last week by a few hundred Mapuche Indians
from Santiago to Valparaiso, where Congress sits. At issue, Indian
advocates say, is a 1992 Indian rights law that prohibits the sale
of Indian lands without the unanimous consent of the community
involved. The law states that only the National Indigenous
Development Board, the government bureau of Indian affairs, which
has strong Indian representation on its board of directors, can
authorize any land swaps.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has argued that in the Ralco case an electric
service law that permits expropriation of property in the interest
of providing energy for the general good takes precedence over the
Indian rights law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Our demand for electric power is growing 8.4 percent every
year,'' said Planning Minister German Quintana Pena in an
interview. ``So we need to generate power at the lowest cost
possible and that means hydroelectric power.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintana Pena said that without the Ralco project Chile would be
forced to import more natural gas from Argentina, and that would
require installing costly pipelines and building new generation
plants around Santiago. Such plants, he added, would only add to
the capital's already severe air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, the government dismissed the director of Chile's
National Environmental Commission, after a commission technical
review board issued a finding against the project. Soon after, the
review board reversed its decision.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Frei dismissed three members of the National
Indigenous Development Board when it appeared that the board would
vote against the project. The vote, which was scheduled for Aug. 6,
was put off.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo Namuncura, who was director of the board until Frei
forced his resignation earlier this month, said he opposed the
Ralco project because he believed some of the Indian families who
have opted to leave were manipulated by the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some can't read, and others thought they had no choice but to
go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Namuncura added that the lands the Indians have been offered
were too barren to support their traditional wheat and potato
crops.
</P>
<P>
   The national debate over their land has startled many in Ralco,
who are accustomed to a quiet life well outside the hubbub of the
modern world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really surprised to be in the middle of this
controversy,'' said Francisco Levi, a 30-year-old farmer. ``But it
does not frighten us. This is the land of our forefathers and we
see no reason to make a change.''

   HARVARD, Ill. _ When a fellow farmer gets into straits, Keith
Kingsley knows, good neighbors come to the rescue with muscle,
machinery or feed.
</P>
<P>
   It should not matter whether the family in peril lives down the
road or 1,000 miles away, in the Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more hay than I can use,'' Kingsley told agriculture
officials on the telephone in grass-scorched Oklahoma, where
desperate farmers have resorted to feeding tree branches and leaves
to starving cows. ``Anybody who needs it can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The agricultural official told Kingsley that the Chickasaw were
among those hit the hardest. Since the Illinois farmer made the
offer late last July, leaders of the Chickasaw Nation in
south-central Oklahoma have been sending big trucks once a week to
collect those bales of hay, which seem as precious as gold.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks have transported about 250 big, round bales, which
weigh 800 to 1,000 pounds. One bale can feed about 35 cows a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's just a drop in the bucket,'' said Kingsley, a
soft-spoken 40-year-old who runs a small dairy farm here with his
son, Darryl, 21. ``But maybe it will help a little.''
</P>
<P>
   When the trucks arrived, the men from Oklahoma looked with
astonishment at the rain-nourished pastures and tall cornfields of
the Upper Midwest. Kingsley remembered one of the Chickasaw
marveling: `` `It's so green. I can't believe it.' ''

   Since Kingsley made his first donation of hay, eight or nine
other dairy farmers who live near Harvard have agreed to contribute
hay to the Chickasaw. Some local farmers, including Dan and Tom
Evers, Jeff Hawthorne and Christ Spiniolas, have also helped load
the bales onto trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Chickasaw in Oklahoma, where hay has been selling on
the roadside for as much as $150 a bale Kingsley's name has become
well known and warmly regarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody appreciates what Keith has done,'' said the
Chickasaw governor, Bill Anoatubby. ``It's nice to know there are
people out there with good hearts.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kingsley, whose family has been raising cows in this hilly
countryside for six generations, said he knew the struggles of
family farmers to survive, even without a drought. The milk
produced on his farm is selling for only about $13 per
hundredweight on the market these days, no better than the price
paid to his late father, Harold, some 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley's wife, Gail, who helps on the farm by milking cows and
running the hay baler, also works at the McHenry County nursing
home. Their son, Darryl, works nights as a bartender in nearby
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farming, like every sector of agriculture, has become
dominated by big operators. Kingsley recalled seeing a dairy farm
on every 80 acres when he was a boy. Many of those families have
given up.
</P>
<P>
   Now the countryside, just a mile or so from the Wisconsin state
line, is becoming a place for expensive houses that belong to
people who work in offices, not cow pastures. Residential growth
has been on the upswing since Motorola opened a huge plant here a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land is just too valuable for farming anymore,'' Kingsley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some newcomers to rural life here complain about mud on the road
or the smells from the dairy barn. Kingsley, who has a gentle way
about him, just smiled and shrugged about the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a field with big bales of hay, a bountiful crop of
alfalfa and orchard grass, Kingsley said he was in no position to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the rain this spring,'' he said with a grateful smile,
``things just grew and grew and grew.''
</P>
<P>
   He mostly wanted to talk about the terrible problems of the
farmers in Oklahoma. ``Some of them have lost 25 percent of their
livestock,'' he said. ``The poor people are just sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Dairy farmers like Kingsley usually need to stay close to home,
tending to the animals. Vacation trips can become few and far
between. For that reason, he has never spent much time beyond this
pocket of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But next February, Keith and Gail Kingsley are going to take a
drive to Oklahoma. They're going to spend some time at the
Chickasaw Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some friends there now, you know,'' he said &QL;

SPACE LIMIT RAISES ISSUE OF WHO RATES ARLINGTON BURIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Space is becoming so scarce at Arlington National
Cemetery that the announcement that three of the Americans killed
in the bomb blast at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, would be
buried there has helped reopen some old wounds.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three _ Julian Bartley Sr., the consul general; his
20-year-old son, Jay Bartley, and Prabhi Guptara Kavaler, an
administrative officer in the embassy _ served in the military. But
because they died serving their country, their families and several
members of Congress requested waivers for their burial at the
Arlington cemetery in Virginia. President Clinton and the Pentagon
granted the waivers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Space is running out at the 612-acre military cemetery, the
nation's most prestigious since President Kennedy's burial there in
1963 made it a national shrine. A General Accounting Office report
estimates that at the current rate of about 20 coffin and urn
burials a day, the cemetery will be full by 2025. Of the 115
national military cemeteries, 60 have closed because they have no
more room.
</P>
<P>
   A spate of recent events, like the Arlington burial of John
Gibson, one of two Capitol Hill police officers killed on duty in a
shootout, has reopened the question of who deserves a space in the
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans, and some members of Congress, are angry that
waivers have been issued for those who did not serve in the
military, while not all veterans are eligible for coffin burial.
Also aggrieved are families denied waivers for relatives who died
serving the government.
</P>
<P>
   Congress began restricting burials at Arlington in 1967 after
Kennedy's burial increased the demand for plots there. Current
regulations stipulate that without a waiver, burial at Arlington is
limited to presidents; those who were on active military duty;
those who were highly decorated (with a Silver Star or higher);
those who spent at least 20 years in the service, or those who were
more than 30 percent disabled when they were discharged. All
honorably discharged veterans are eligible to have their cremated
remains placed in urns in the cemetery's vault.
</P>
<P>
   If all veterans were eligible for coffin burial at Arlington,
the cemetery would reach capacity in 2020.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 waivers have been granted since 1967, an administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   After a scandal earlier this year _ in which M. Larry Lawrence,
a former ambassador to Switzerland and a Democratic campaign
contributor, was exhumed from Arlington because he had fabricated
part of his military background _ the House voted unanimously to
stop issuing waivers and to restrict burial to veterans. Despite
that bill, which has not been taken up in the Senate, House members
were the first to call last month for an Arlington burial for
Gibson, who had never served in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver for Gibson raised the ire of Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz.,
chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee. He had drafted the
proposed restrictions. He is also seeking to expand the size of the
Arlington cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   At least two veterans groups have joined Stump's crusade. ``We
should not be making waivers to allow civilians in a veterans
cemetery that denies access to veterans,'' said Dick Johnson, of
the Non-Commissioned Officers Association of the United States of
America.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans are not the only ones who are unhappy over the
waivers. So are some of those denied waivers for their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Dobert's daughter, Gail, a civilian employee at the
Commerce Department, was killed in 1996 in an airplane crash in
Yugoslavia along with Ron Brown, who was the Commerce Secretary.
Mrs. Dobert sought a waiver for her daughter to be buried at
Arlington but said the White House lobbied her to drop the request
so as not to put the president in the awkward position of refusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely in no way want to trivialize the military,'' Mrs.
Dobert said, ``and I think it's proper that Officer Gibson and the
Bartleys and other civilians are in that place of honor, but they
should be fair and consistent about it.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said that waivers always caused some
``disgruntlement'' but that the administration must be judicious
because space is vanishing. &QL;

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like an armada of tall ships, tales of the sea are sailing onto
bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   There are salty soap operas featuring sensitive mariners drawn
to the high seas to heal marital heartbreak or cope with terminal
disease. There are manly memoirs and survival books by Alaskan crab
fishermen and Antarctic explorers. For hard-core nautical buffs
there are handsome books on maritime arcana and history, like the
recent ``Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain,
660-1649,'' by N.A.M. Rodger (W.W. Norton, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   And then there are recycled classics like C.S. Forester's
swashbuckling Horatio Hornblower adventures and more obscure novels
like ``The Black Ship,'' a 1963 work by Dudley Pope about a bloody
mutiny aboard the HMS Hermione in 1797.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about the siren call of the sea that makes readers
want to thumb through a ``cookery book'' like ``Lobscouse &AMP; Spotted
Dog'' (Norton, 1998) for recipes for sweetbreads in malmsey,
spotted dog (an eggy custard tinged with rosewater) and other
18th-century galley fare?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answer, there is enough money in seafaring
literature these days to prompt a host of trade publishers to cash
in. The boom has been driven mainly by Norton's success with
Patrick O'Brian's series of historical seafaring novels following
the exploits of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and ``The Perfect
Storm,'' Sebastian Junger's 1997 nonfiction best-seller about the
destruction of a swordfishing boat by a violent Atlantic
nor'easter.
</P>
<P>
   Such imitation in publishing is as basic as paper. Publishing
houses are simply observing a cherished and fundamental ritual of
the trade: Follow the wake of popular books with titles in every
possible permutation till the boom goes bust. Sometimes the
publishing pack is hungry for memoirs of dysfunction and anorexia;
in other cases it's mystery books mixed with cooking recipes or
titles by new-age authors with direct lines to God.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing follow the leader here,'' said Starling
Lawrence, editor in chief of Norton. There are more than 3 million
copies of the 18 Aubrey-Maturin books in print, Lawrence noted,
with the next installment, ``The Hundred Days,'' to be published in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence sees little evidence that the public hunger for naval
literature has been sated. He said several publishers were prepared
to pay a seven-figure advance this summer for a manuscript about
the 1820 wreck of a whaling ship by a whale. But before the auction
could take place, Penguin Putnam placed a preemptive bid of more
than $1 million for the book, ``In the Heart of the Sea,'' a
true-life adventure that inspired ``Moby Dick.'' (Penguin has also
found modest success with a more contemporary adventure, ``Sea
Change,'' which mixes memoir, wounded heart and Atlantic
adventure.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You had several publishers willing to take a huge bet,''
Lawrence said. ``This may represent some kind of high-water folly _
I don't know _ or it may just be the smart money chasing the next
boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Other publishing houses are trolling for titles in used
bookstores. Merritt Communications _ a Connecticut company best
known for magazines like Tomorrow's Pharmacist _ has rolled out a
new imprint called Capstan Press, which will publish golden oldies
like Jack London's ``Cruise of the Snark'' and ``Northern Lights,''
a 1927 nonfiction account of a potato lugger that sailed into a
raging Atlantic storm.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Holt &AMP; Co., with its new Heart of Oaks Sea Classics
series, recently reissued ``Peter Simple,'' an 1832 novel by
Frederick Marryat, a former Royal Navy captain, and ``Dr. Dogbody's
Leg,'' a 1940 collection of short stories by James Norman Hall
featuring a peg-legged narrator.
</P>
<P>
   Dean King, editor of Heart of Oaks Sea Classics, said he got the
idea for the series when he found ``Dr. Dogbody's Leg'' at the
bottom of a pile of books in the Argosy bookstore in New York. He
had already written two successful companion guides for O'Brian's
series that together have sold more than 125,000 copies for Holt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, life is lived more vicariously these days,''
King said. ``We spend our time on computers and phone lines. We
have very specialized and narrowly focused skills that are often
far removed from our physical lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The attraction of sea literature is the conflict of ``man versus
nature,'' he added. ``I think we long for that interaction with our
natural world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the popularity of nautical literature has yet to lead
to full-scale sea battle reenactments, it has inspired readers to
develop some exotic pursuits. King, for example, took a voyage to
Bermuda in June with a group of other O'Brian fans aboard the HMS
Rose, a 30-gun frigate that is a replica of a 1750s British ship
that was stationed in North America. The same frigate had been used
earlier this summer to stage a sumptuous meal for sea literature
aficionados like William F. Buckley Jr. and Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brian's devoted following includes Paul LeClerc, president of
the New York Public Library, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy. LeClerc said O'Brian ``succeeds in creating a whole
world out of language that is exotic, mystifying and enthralling
and addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, like LeClerc, is not a sailor, but his reading material
has ranged from O'Brian's books to ``The Perfect Storm'' to ``The
Ordinary Seaman,'' a recent novel by Francisco Goldman about
Central American sailors stranded aboard a rat-infested cargo ship
docked outside New York. The appeal of such books, Kennedy said,
has to do with the ocean as a ``metaphor for our own existence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our liberty to succeed or fail, but in another sense
our fate is controlled by unseen sources,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Sir Edmund Hillary, who conquered Mount Everest in 1953,
best understood the enduring fascination of sea literature.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1976 forward to ``Shackleton's Boat Journey,'' the memoir
of a frostbitten 1914-1916 Antarctica expedition that has just been
reissued by Norton, Hillary wondered how the ``hard men of today
with their fancy equipment and `instant rescue' by radio and
helicopter would have survived under such conditions?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger is one thing,'' he wrote, ``but danger plus extreme
discomfort for long periods is quite another.''

COMMENTARY: 1600 MADISON AVE. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the new Tommy Hilfiger ad, a luscious young woman with
cascading hair, pouty mouth, black leather pants and bare feet is
curled on top of the president's desk, casting a come-hither look.
The American flag is behind her.
</P>
<P>
   In another shot, the babe is squatting on the blue Oval Office
rug, her knees over the presidential seal, her eager face looking
up.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal chic has come to Madison Avenue. Patriotism and
titillation _ a winning combination to hawk backpacks and loafers.
</P>
<P>
   Though a Hilfiger spokeswoman denied any connection, the ad is
clearly a mischievous allusion to Monica and Bill. It is a landmark
in advertising history to use the White House to conjure up an
image of sexual high jinks.
</P>
<P>
   The press release announcing the fall clothing campaign, shot on
sets from the movies ``Dave'' and ``The American President,'' is
unintentionally hilarious: ``This campaign showcases the optimistic
spirit and energy of classic Americanism,'' said the designer Tommy
Hilfiger. ``We wanted to use as a theme what the White House
represents to the American people _ a symbol of hope. Our White
House is all inclusive. Anyone could be president.''
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles computer retailer ran an ad in The Los Angeles
Times boasting that its prices were ``dropping faster than the
president's pants.'' The Los Angeles Times also reported that the
White House complained to Excite, an Internet search-engine
company, about its ad suggesting that Clinton's handwriting showed
a desire to ``buy lingerie for that special someone.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first scandal with product placement. Donna Karan,
the Gap, Starbucks, Black Dog and Barnes &AMP; Noble have had cameos.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Della Femina, the Republican advertising executive, blames
the president for setting a climate that gives advertisers
permission ``to make fun of the office. It's time I brought back
Joe Isuzu.''
</P>
<P>
   Donny Deutsch, the advertising executive who worked on the
Clinton campaign, thinks the Hilfiger ad will enhance the
president's allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hilfiger ad glamorizes the scandal, brings it to true
fantasy as opposed to the tawdry reality,'' he says. ``A beautiful
young woman in the most powerful universe in the world. It's right
out of a romance novel. A young maiden in a castle. It adds to
Clinton's potency.''
</P>
<P>
   He's curious to see what endorsement deals Monica is offered.
``She is the woman who almost brought down the free world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the television critics' tour in Pasadena last month, the UPN
network unveiled a sitcom called ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer,'' set in Lincoln's White House, which jokes that Mrs.
Lincoln's mental illness might be the result of sexual frustration
and that President Lincoln occasionally longs for the companionship
of young boys.
</P>
<P>
   The producers acknowledged that the excesses of the Clinton
White House had helped make any presidency fair game for ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to get that moral authority thing rolling when the
White House is polling to see whether or not the president should
tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has condemned himself to provide lurid entertainment for
a society addicted to lurid entertainment. He has a double-entendre
presidency, where the nightly news is now the nightly gross-out,
where talk of an address to the nation collapses into snickering
about a dress to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the '92 race, Clinton said he wanted to be at the center of a
national conversation. Whoever imagined the conversation would be
so salacious? So far, we have discussed: What is sex? Does a
president have the right to cheat on his wife? Should the public
care about infidelity if the wife doesn't? Is private consensual
sex the proper domain of a special prosecutor? Is extramarital sex
the one thing a husband should lie about? What is a lie?
</P>
<P>
   Covering Ronald Reagan, we avoided the word ``lying,'' even
though Reagan was prone to spin myths and say black was white. It
just seemed too disrespectful of the office. Now, it has become
commonplace. If you do a search in Lexis-Nexis with ``President
Clinton'' and ``lie,'' the computer replies: ``Your search has been
interrupted because it will probably retrieve more than 1,000
documents.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To many people who live here and to the millions
who visit each year, San Francisco is a jewel among American cities
for its beauty, culture and quirkiness. For entirely different
reasons, a rising number of homeless people also find it ideal.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, San Francisco may be the best haven in the
United States for the homeless. The weather is consistently mild.
City welfare benefits are larger than those available in most other
places _ by more than $100 a month in some cases _ and have no
cutoff time.
</P>
<P>
   Further, as one of the nation's last bastions of liberalism, San
Francisco offers an unusually wide array of free services for the
poor through public and private programs that help with housing,
medical needs, child care, job training and substance-abuse
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're humanistic,'' Mayor Willie Brown said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the efforts here to address the complexities of
homelessness, people who work with San Francisco's poor say their
programs cannot be stretched to cover the number of people who need
them.
</P>
<P>
   The experts contend that the city's long history of tolerance,
individual benefits of $345 a month and support programs serve as a
magnet for homeless people at a time when the city cannot meet the
demand for affordable housing and housing costs overall have become
the highest of any city in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still losing ground,'' said Will Lightbourne, executive
director of the Department of Human Services. ``It's a supply
issue, and we're not a nation-state. People are free to move
here.''
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, the number of homeless here has increased to
16,000 people on any given night, almost twice the number of a
decade ago, and experts say many of them have mental disorders,
physical disabilities and diseases like AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty,
a Washington-based advocacy group for the poor, have found that
only New York and Los Angeles, the largest cities in the country,
have more homeless people than San Francisco, which was the
13th-largest city in 1996, with a population of 735,315, according
to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters here are economic forces that are pushing
even more people into homelessness. San Francisco is a small place,
less than 50 square miles, with water on three sides. Many
neighborhoods are changing, with new shops and restaurants helping
to drive up residential rents. In a city where the vacancy rate
seldom exceeds 1 percent, one-bedroom apartments even in
working-class neighborhoods can rent for $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, building owners who once used federal grants
to subsidize rents for low-income people are converting their
properties into expensive units for sale or rent. Maggie Donahue,
director of the city's housing and homeless programs, said San
Francisco had 12,000 single-room units, less than half the number
of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a yuppie town, where it seems like
gentrification is a citywide program,'' said Paul Boden of the
Coalition on Homelessness, which creates low-income housing here.
``It wasn't that long ago you could still find flophouses where
people could stay for $50 a week. Now they're not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Donahue and other city officials do not necessarily disagree
with Boden. They say the city and nonprofit groups are doing
everything possible to meet the demands of the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the city government has worked with many
private groups and with the federal government to create more
housing for low-income people. Just this week, the city broke
ground on the first of three developments that will provide
affordable housing _ 331 apartments _ and more projects are
planned.
</P>
<P>
   And Lightbourne said that the city was doing more to address the
causes of homelessness, with new job-training programs, and plans
to create three single-occupancy hotels for people with chronic
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   That scarcely puts a dent in the city's overall needs. Ron
Sonenshine, spokesman for the city's public housing agency, said
the current stock of 6,100 units accommodated 25,000 people, but
with a low vacancy rate some of the 14,000 people on waiting lists
could wait eight years.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has drawn sharp criticism for police crackdowns that
swept homeless people out of encampments in Golden Gate Park,
conceded that governments at all levels were not doing enough to
help the homeless and working poor.
</P>
<P>
   But recognizing that he must satisfy different constituencies,
including business leaders who depend upon revenues from tourism,
he defended the city's current approach. He said that the supply of
shelter beds was adequate and that aggressive enforcement of laws
that keep the homeless from sleeping in public places was
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Cecil Williams of the Glide Memorial United Methodist
Church, which runs one of the city's largest homeless centers, with
43 programs serving 5,000 people a day, predicted that problems
facing the city would get worse without more money and housing
units. Criticizing the city for relying too much on private
agencies, he said, ``Nobody has any real grip on what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of San Francisco's homeless, no amount of effort is
likely to make much of a difference. Ronald Greenspane, director of
Community Awareness and Treatment Services, a nonprofit group that
specializes in helping homeless people who have substance-abuse
problems, AIDS and mental disorders, said many homeless people say
they simply do not want the help that is offered.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting informal interviews of about 500 people served by his
group, Greenspane said he estimated that as many as 70 percent of
homeless people were substance abusers, as many as 40 percent had a
mental disorder and more than a third of them had been living in
San Francisco for five years or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good number of them,'' he said, ``don't want to have a thing
to do with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The homeless have become an indelible part of the city's
landscape, along with the well-to-do residents and the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Sad-faced panhandlers seem to be everywhere, many with a story
or hand-scribbled sign that speaks of dire need or misfortune. Most
accept rejections of their requests for money without question. But
many others persist, following pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hailey, who has given walking tours of the Castro
district for the last nine years, said that in recent years,
panhandlers had become ``incredibly more demanding with
in-your-face tactics.'' Some business owners in the neighborhood,
she said, have begun displaying signs urging residents to give
money to service providers, rather than the panhandlers. ``The
merchants even provide the envelope to mail in a donation,'' Ms.
Hailey said.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the scenes here are reminiscent of New York City a
decade ago, when some streets were so crowded with the homeless
that only the more creative panhandlers succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates here are less fearful that Brown or a successor
might respond as aggressively as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has in New
York. His ``quality of life'' campaign has pushed the homeless to
the margins of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The police here might sweep downtown doorways and Golden Gate
Park now and then to roust homeless people sleeping there. But in a
city with so many open arms and deep pockets, they are not likely
to go far.

SCIENTISTS DEBATE CHINA'S LAW ON STERILIZING CARRIERS OF GENETIC
DEFECTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In an unusual move, the 2,000 scientists gathered here
this week for the 18th International Congress of Genetics took time
out from discussions of cloning and cancer genes to confront a
controversial Chinese law, one that many experts believe permits
doctors to require that people with serious genetic conditions be
sterilized.
</P>
<P>
   In several forums, and even at the closing ceremonies, some of
the world's foremost geneticists scrutinized, and sometimes
criticized, the vaguely worded 1994 law, debating whether it
intended to condone forced sterilization or was just so poorly
worded that it left that option open.
</P>
<P>
   China's Maternal Infant Health Care Law, originally known as the
Eugenics Law, had so offended some scientists that national
genetics societies from England, Holland and Argentina boycotted
their profession's most prestigious general meeting, held once
every five years.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the International Genetics Federation remained
committed to the Beijing site _ on condition that the meeting
include a forum to discuss the issue of eugenics as well as this
law. And ultimately many scientists with misgivings decided to
attend, hoping that an open discussion on Chinese soil might
influence policy here and lend support to Chinese bioethicists and
geneticists who have themselves, with some recent success, pressed
the government for revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eugenics has always been an issue for geneticists, but the
Chinese law has given this a razor-sharp edge,'' said Anthony
Griffiths, the Canadian secretary general of the federation, at a
packed, lively forum Wednesday evening titled ``The Science and
Ethics of Eugenics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in China. We are geneticists. I think we need to say
something on this issue,'' Griffiths said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, dozens of scientists from China and a dozen other
countries stepped up to the microphone for a wide-ranging and
remarkably frank debate. Excerpts from the law, projected on a
screen at the front of the room, served as a sort of Rorschach test
for some of the thorniest issues in bioethics.
</P>
<P>
   While there was general agreement that the wording of the law
should be improved, the debate also revealed considerable cultural
rifts. For example, ``eugenics,'' a term referring to improving the
human race through controlled breeding, has weighty negative
connotations in the West, where it evokes the Nazi campaign for
racial purification through forced sterilization and extermination
of the ostensibly unfit. The term has more positive associations in
China and in some other East Asian countries, where it retains much
of the original sense of ``excellent birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 law, whose main purpose is to guarantee prenatal and
pediatric health care to poor women and children, nonetheless
contains two small but controversial articles dealing with genetic
counseling. They stipulate that couples undergoing their required
premarital physical examination be informed of any genetic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But articles 10 and 16 then direct doctors to ``take steps'' to
``prevent childbearing'' _ through sterilization or long-term
contraception _ should a problem be detected. And the law is
unclear as to who should make the decision regarding sterilization
_ the doctor or the couple. Griffiths said that many scientists and
human right advocates were concerned about the ambiguity,
particularly given the charges of forced sterilization that have
plagued China's one-child family program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Chinese geneticists were clearly roiled that the
international community had singled out their country for
criticism. ``The goal of the session is to clarify the idea of
eugenics, not to discuss one country's or another country's law _
we should not discuss China's laws,'' said one angry scientist who
gave his surname as Zhang.
</P>
<P>
   But another Chinese scientist, Yang Huanming, quickly took the
microphone to disagree. ``I think a free atmosphere is very
important for this law,'' he said. ``I think everyone should be
encouraged to say what they are thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Qiu Renzong, a leading bioethicist at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, helped organize the forum. Qiu, who
assisted in drafting the law and praises its overall intent, has
nonetheless criticized the wording of the two articles on genetic
counseling as well as their translation into English. He said that
decisions regarding marriage and childbearing for people with
genetic problems should be a matter of individual choice, and
worried that the law's vague and contradictory language might lead
doctors to conclude otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Qiu said that the Ministry of Health has been generally
sympathetic to his concerns and this week had ``confirmed the
principle of informed consent.'' But, he added, ``I still think we
need changes in the wording of some articles.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Article 10, for example, says that physicians must give
``medical advice'' to couples who have been ``diagnosed with
certain genetic diseases of serious nature which are considered
inappropriate for childbearing.'' It continues, ``The two may be
married only if both agree to take long-term contraceptive measures
or to take a ligation operation for sterility.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many people have been sterilized or forbidden
to marry under the law, since Qiu said that provinces were
generally still preparing to implement it. But local laws requiring
sterilization under narrower circumstances already exist. In 1988,
Gansu province in northwest China passed a law requiring compulsory
sterilization of people with IQ's under 49. Several other provinces
subsequently adopted similar provisions.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, the debate over the national law turned
partly on semantics: Did it really intend to allow doctors to
prohibit people with genetic disease from having children and, if
so, what ``serious genetic diseases'' are included? Article 19, for
example, says that sterilization surgery must be ``agreed and
signed upon'' by the patient.
</P>
<P>
   And did the official English translation at the very least
misrepresent the law to the outside world? Although the law was
originally called the Eugenics Law, Qiu successfully pressed the
government to avoid using the word ``eugenics'' in part because of
its negative connotations in the West.
</P>
<P>
   But more substantive differences were also aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many countries people have been exterminated in the name of
eugenics,'' said Valery Soyfer, a Russian-born geneticist now at
George Mason University in Virginia, who lost his job in the former
Soviet Union when he spoke out in support of the dissident
scientist Andrei Sakharov. He added: ``That's why people in the
genetic community are concerned. What is this law? We're not going
to intervene, but we think we have a responsibility to share our
history.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many scientists said that genetic counseling should provide
individuals with impartial information to help them make their own
medical decisions, and not be an instrument of government policy,
coercion or social betterment _ an opinion that was pointedly made
by federation officials at Saturday's closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   But others noted that Asian and Western scientists were likely
to disagree somewhat on this issue since Asian societies tend to
place greater value on the collective good, while Western culture
focuses more on the individual.
</P>
<P>
   When Xin Mao, a Chinese geneticist now working in England,
polled genetic counselors from 37 countries on whether reducing
defective genes in the population was an important goal of their
work, all respondents in China said ``yes,'' while fewer than 6
percent in Canada and 5 percent in the United States agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, scientists from both the West and China pointed out
that sterilization of people with obvious handicaps was not an
effective way to ``cleanse the gene pool,'' as the survey put it,
since most potentially disease-causing genes are recessive and lie
silently in the cells of apparently healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   Qiu said that Chinese physicians are becoming more sophisticated
about genetics and patients' rights. Walter Bodmer, a leading
geneticist at Oxford University, reminded the audience that such
developments were fairly recent in the West as well. Canada
required sterilization of some mentally retarded people as recently
as the 1960s, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths said he was heartened that the Chinese government was
endorsing informed consent, but added: ``It all depends what they
mean by informed consent. That may mean the doctors tells you what
to do and you do it.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In seven years, according to the Census Bureau,
blacks will no longer be the nation's largest minority group, for
the first time since the federal government began keeping an
official count of the population.
</P>
<P>
   As the country hurtles toward this demographic Rubicon, the
ascendancy of Hispanic people as the leading minority, in terms of
their share of the population, is generating a range of reaction
among experts on the country's racial dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Some are fearful, sensing a lessening of black influence and an
increase in tension as many black and Hispanic Americans compete to
move up the economic ladder. Some are optimistic that strong
alliances can be formed on issues like education, affirmative
action and reform of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that blacks will continue to set the pace with
regard to the racial climate. Still others suggest that this
dynamic depends not only on the increased Hispanic population and
whether the large proportion of it who are aliens _ legal and
illegal _ become citizens and vote, but also on the rate of
intermarriage with whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major demographic shift that's going to hit and it
will have some significant political ramifications,'' said Eddie
Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a research organization that studies racial issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among some liberals and some conservatives, there is surprising
agreement that the burgeoning Hispanic population and the
fast-growing Asian population _ both of which are much more diverse
and perhaps less strident on racial matters than are blacks _ will
alter racial dialogue that, as Jim Sleeper, author of ``Liberal
Racism'' (Viking, 1997) said, has been dominated by ``whites or
blacks who have been locked in a kind of psychic and physical
embrace for the last 300 years.''
</P>
<P>
   One liberal black civil rights leader, who asked not to be
identified, said that as a result of the increase in the Hispanic
and Asian populations ``the emergence of class interests has the
potential to be as significant to the next century as race was in
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of solidarity of people of color _ in part,
because both groups are disproportionately poor _ their interests
often diverge. According to exit polls conducted by The Los Angeles
Times, 47 percent of black voters in California supported a 1994
ballot initiative to restrict benefits to illegal aliens and 48
percent backed another voter initiative this year to curtail
bilingual education severely. The two groups have also squabbled
over control and jobs at the Martin Luther King, Jr., Hospital in
Los Angeles, access to public housing in Chicago and political
power in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats hold on to the White House, a flash point may
loom in the coming years over the next vacancy on the Supreme
Court. In the wake of the retirement or death of a justice,
Hispanic leaders will likely press for the appointment of the
country's first Hispanic justice. That demand may put them at odds
with blacks who feel poorly represented by Justice Clarence Thomas
and want a more liberal black justice on the court.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper's poll also showed that 74 percent of
California's blacks and 76 percent of its Hispanic citizens voted
against a ballot measure that ended affirmative action in state
hiring, contracting and public university admissions. And both
groups are jointly fighting Republicans, who want to prevent the
Census Bureau from using modern statistical methods for a more
accurate count in the 2000 Census, which would probably increase
minority numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that we can now begin to form alliances and it
need not be a zero sum game,'' said Raul Yzaguirre, president of
the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The changing racial dynamic may also depend on another
phenomenon. In the 1990 Census, 31.4 percent of Hispanic women who
were married reported that their husband was non-Hispanic, with the
overwhelming majority of these spouses being non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, only 6.3 percent of black women who were married
had husbands of another racial group. The census data
underrepresents the black intermarriage rate since it is based on
the woman's choice of partner and demographers note that black men
marry white women in greater numbers than black women marry white
men.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that Hispanic people are far more likely to
marry outside their ethnic group than blacks are. No one knows what
this high rate of intermarriage between Hispanic and non-Hispanic
whites portends. The children of such unions could just as easily
identify with the larger Anglo society as with disadvantaged
``people of color,'' making the notion of solidarity with blacks
either a reality or a pipe dream depending on which way they go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could end up being honorary whites,'' said Ronald
Walters, a political scientist at the University of Maryland. ``We
could end up with a situation like they had in South Africa or
Brazil.''

U.S. TENTATIVELY LINKS MILITANT SAUDI BUSINESSMAN TO AFRICA
BOMBINGS

   WASHINGTON _ Federal law enforcement officials said Saturday
that they had obtained information tentatively linking an associate
of Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman who has vowed to
wage a holy war against the United States, to the bombing of the
American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The officials declined to specify the nature of the evidence
connecting Bin Laden to the bombings. But Saturday's issue of
Newsday reported that a witness had identified a Bin Laden
associate as having been in the truck carrying the bomb that
damaged the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Kenya and killed more
than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper identified the witness as one of the two privately
employed security guards working at the embassy gate at the time of
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Saturday, intelligence and law enforcement
officials who asked not to be identified said there had not been
positive identification of the suspect, who was described as a
relatively low-level member of Bin Laden's circle.
</P>
<P>
   But officials indicated that this was the first potential
evidence leading to Bin Laden, whom the FBI and the CIA have
suspected from the start was a key figure in the bombing plot.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have cited him since the early hours of the
investigation. This year he renewed his vow to wage a holy war
against the United States, and senior officials have said he has a
network in Africa, with U.S. intelligence finding evidence that he
has operatives in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials caution that there has been no hard evidence
linking Bin Laden or his agents to the bombings, Americans point to
the nearly simultaneous explosions on Aug. 7 as a sign that the
attacks were carried out by sophisticated terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's network has the financial resources and the
organization to have been the mastermind, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group suspected by the United States is the Cairo-based
Islamic Jihad, but it, too, is financed by Bin Laden, American
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a wealthy Saudi family that made its money in the
construction business, Bin Laden is thought to have been involved
in the bombings of two U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   But for lack of evidence, the United States has never issued an
arrest warrant for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden lived for a time in the Sudan. He is said to live in
Afghanistan now, under the protection of the Taliban, the
fundamentalist Islamic group that controls most of the country. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Otto von Bismarck, Germany's ``iron
chancellor,'' started a worldwide revolution when he created the
first state-run social security system in 1883. No one seriously
challenged that model until another man of iron will, Gen. Augusto
Pinochet of Chile, installed the first privatized pension system
here 98 years later, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Today a lot of conservatives are proclaiming that a century of
increasing government responsibility for social welfare is over in
the West, and aging populations and dropping birth rates will make
pay-as-you-go social security impossible to sustain even in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   So they are looking at the Chilean solution: privately managed,
individually owned retirement accounts based on the compounded
magic of stocks and bonds, as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But before Pinochet replaces Bismarck in any pantheon of
jackbooted social reformers, his new model must first survive a
test: the contagion spreading from Asia's deepening economic
crisis, which is shaking Chile harder than almost any other country
in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 months, Chile's stock market has lost more than 25 percent
in dollar terms, largely in response to faltering exports to Asia
and falling copper prices tied to Japan's economic slowdown. Some
analysts fear that a deep recession will replace years of steady
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Although supporters of the Chilean pension system point out that
the diversified portfolios in Chile's retirement accounts have
eased the losses, pensioners and workers are lining up in the
offices of pension management companies with questions fraught with
doubt. Simply put, privatization has proven no panacea for the
insecurities people feel when thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are forcing me to acquire risk that I may not want,'' said
Luis Felipe Jimenez, an economist for the United Nations,
paraphrasing the fears. Andres Uthoff, another U.N. economist,
added, ``It will take a generation to see if this will work or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the international response to the Chilean model has been
bullish. Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru
and Uruguay adopted some form of Chile's system over the last five
years, and a similar system is working its way through Poland's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, as well
as conservatives who include a former Reagan administration
economist, Martin Feldstein, have praised the Chilean experiment as
a model for boosting national savings, stimulating economic growth
and securing the futures of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Even a few liberals, notably Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., have said the United States should consider some
privatization of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a megatrend,'' said Jose Pinera, who designed the
Chilean pension system as Pinochet's secretary of labor and social
security. ``The pay-as-you-go system is like the Titanic going
directly toward the iceberg of an aging population and declining
fertility rates. Fortunately there is Chilean ship of individual
private accounts nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   But before jumping ship, policy makers can look at Chile's model
as a lesson in what a privatized pension system can and cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's plan requires those who entered the work force after
1981 to automatically put 10 percent or more of their wages into an
individual retirement account, which is not taxed until withdrawal.
(Older workers had the option of remaining in the traditional
social security system). The amount of pension due upon retirement
depends on the amount a worker accumulates, along with the
investment returns earned by whichever one of 14 private pension
fund companies the worker selects to manage the account. The
portfolios are regulated and the returns monitored by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Once retired, a worker can put the accumulated capital into an
annuity provided by a life insurance company. Or the funds may
remain in the retirement account, from which regular withdrawals
can be made. A basic guarantee remains: those who have not
accumulated a minimum pension receive a government allowance that
can be considerably below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   Critics point out that workers must pay high management fees to
funds that, because of regulation, offer little choice in
investments. Nevertheless, in their early years, the funds were a
smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the workers who had a choice opted for
the new system. The funds accumulated $30 billion by 1997,
delivering a stunning 12 percent average annual return in the first
15 years. The savings rate blossomed from single digits to 25
percent of gross domestic product, helping to fuel a rapid
expansion in the securities markets.
</P>
<P>
   The winning streak has faltered in recent years, however. The
average returns for the pension funds declined from an 18 percent
gain in 1994 to a 2.5 percent loss in 1995, followed by gains of
3.5 percent in 1996 and 4.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 months, the average fund is down about 5
percent _ not bad, considering the plunge in the Chilean stock
market. But the reason for the modest losses is instructive: The
pension funds have been dumping Chilean stocks.
</P>
<P>
   They have reduced their exposure in the local stock exchange
from over 30 percent four years ago to under 20 percent today,
while acquiring more conservative fixed-income investments and
foreign stocks. One effect is that the funds have effectively
helped drive down the same stock market they once drove up. And the
market swings have prompted some workers to put off retirement.
</P>
<P>
   This illustrates one of the risks that critics of privatization
are fond of pointing out: Linking social security and the
securities markets may spread wealth in boom times, but it can
multiply the intensity and effects of a recession as well.
</P>
<P>
   How accurate a gauge the Chilean experience _ both good and not
so good _ can be for the United States is not quite clear. No one,
for example, seriously believes that the same system adopted under
a dictatorship in a developing country of 15 million people would
be so easily adopted or regulated in a country as wealthy, large,
complex and politically voluble as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chileans are learning the downside of a system tied
to fluctuating markets. ``I may seem calm on the outside, but my
stomach is churning,'' said Fabian Moraga, a 33-year-old computer
technician. He has accumulate $10,000 in his pension account over
10 years. But with a chronically sick child at home, Moraga said,
any risk frightens him. ``I don't know what will happen tomorrow
with these stock markets,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pinera, the Chilean system's designer, has a response to that
kind of fear: It's all part of accepting individual responsibility.
``I can bet you 10 to 1,'' he said, ``that the average annual rate
of return for the funds over the next 45 years will not be negative
after 17 years of 11.5 percent returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinera may well be right about the odds. But what Moraga wants
is a sure thing.

   DDN-COX-CHIRO _ DAYTON _ From a nondescript clinic in tiny
Medway, Dr. David E. Polen has attracted a loyal following of
patients who say he's helped them when conventional medicine has
failed. But a Dayton Daily News examination of lawsuits, bankruptcy
records and a transcript of a deposition a cancer victim gave
before a regulatory board just before her death show Polen's
unconventional practices have also attracted the scrutiny of
regulators and brought complaints from patients and family members
alleging the Medway chiropractor exploited their trust. Polen
treated two other patients who delayed getting medical treatment
that may have extended or saved their lives, including a woman who
died of breast cancer in 1980. Her daughter, in a lawsuit filed a
year later, alleged that Polen told her mother the lump on her
breast was caused by infection and hookworm, and treated her for
seven months with poultices of buckwheat, flour, grated potatoes,
castor oil and vitamins. (Hundley/Hills, Dayton Daily News)

   PBP-GAMBLE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ More than 200 years ago,
the framers of the Constitution cut a deal with the nation's
Indians that today may clear the way for 24-hour casinos featuring
booze, blackjack, lotteries, parimutuels and other games of chance
year round. It's a deal that has brought negotiations for tribal
casinos to the table and thrust the issue into courtrooms around

first asked to open full-blown casinos, maneuvering over the issue
is intensifying. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post)

because she feels the president is in grave danger of being hung

klansmen torching his home. The Dahmer family has waited a long
time for this day; meanwhile, Bowers and his co-defendants are
cocky. Bowers has said he wants to get in court as soon as
possible. And Devours Nix, who was arrested and will stand trial
later this year, got out of jail by claiming he was too ill for it,

   CLINTON-PRESIDENCY _ WASHINGTON _ The prolonged investigations
into President Clinton's personal life and his past financial
dealings have forever changed the presidency. Experts believe that
court decisions requiring the testimony of Secret Service agents
assigned to the president, as well as rulings stripping away
executive privilege from top presidential aides, will cause future
presidents to alter their conduct, making them unreasonably
cautious about everything they say or do while in the White House.
And forcing the commander-in-chief to testify in civil trials and
grand juries, as Clinton must do on Monday, could signal a future
in which presidents spend much of their time with lawyers prepping

   CLINTON-RECORD _ WASHINGTON _ Even if President Clinton did
something X-rated in private, goes the line spun out of the White
House, what counts is his public performance for the nation's
schools, families, economy and for its standing abroad. What
exactly has the Clinton administration accomplished, when measured
by its own goals? Certainly no president in memory, and probably
ever, has offered a higher stack of promises. With each campaign
and State of the Union address, Clinton has spread out scores of
new initiatives and proposals, from the minuscule to the expansive,
like so many hoagies and puff pastries on a vast smorgasbord. And
six years into his presidency, a few have been delivered, some have
been sent back to the kitchen by the Republican Congress, and many
others some seem a bit, well, moldy. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-REPORTERS _ WASHINGTON _ They slogged through Whitewater
despite a public that often preferred to hear less rather than more

Clinton White House and sometimes faced resistance from fellow
reporters and their own publications. Now the handful of
journalists who have followed a trail of Clinton controversies for
six years are seeing their work lead to the first-ever appearance
by a president before a criminal grand jury. The persistence of
fewer than a dozen reporters has been largely responsible for
keeping the issue of Clinton's conduct before the country. ``The
heroes are the ones that have kept it alive,'' says Britt Hume, who
anchors an evening report on Washington for Fox Cable News. ``These
people have done tremendously well on this story, and it hasn't
been easy.'' Among them: Susan Schmidt of The Washington Post,
Newsweek's Mike Isikoff, Steve Labaton of The New York Times, Pete
Yost of the AP, as well as Jackie Judd and Chris Vlasto of ABC.

<P>
   States around the country are breaking up utility monopolies,
hoping to create a competitive marketplace for electricity. But
that does not mean the monopolies are disappearing; some may just
be turning sideways, moving away from vertical operations that
controlled coal mines, power stations and meters and toward a
horizontal business that manages huge groups of generating
stations. Leading the turn, some experts predict, will be nuclear
power.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation has attracted suitors for the generating stations
and created an opportunity to operate them almost like McDonald's
franchises. Big regional utilities like Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric,
Duke Power Co. and Entergy have set up affiliates that build or buy
generating stations far from their home territory.
</P>
<P>
   Two nuclear power plants in Maine and Pennsylvania have recently
been cast out into the cold by owners facing deregulation and they
have tried to market themselves like middle-aged managers laid off
in corporate downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will end up owned by people who can run them efficiently
and do well, not by all these mom-and-pop utilities,'' said one
utility shopper, Richard Bornemann, a former vice president of
United Illuminating, an electric company in southern Connecticut
that is part owner of several nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Few people think of a company running nuclear reactors as a
``mom and pop'' operation. But one of Bornemann's partners, Dr.
Shelby Brewer, a top executive of Combustion Engineering when that
company was an independent reactor manufacturer, predicted that the
industry would become so consolidated in a few years that only two
or three companies _ not scores of them _ would be running the
remaining reactors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Making the right decision about old reactors is important to
consumers' bills. In the 1970s and 1980s the utility industry
wasted tens of billions of dollars on more than 100 reactors that
were later abandoned before completion because they were
uneconomical. It spent tens of billions completing others that
should not have built. Now the industry must decide which plants
can continue to operate efficiently and at low risk.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of assembling reactors into chains is rather stunning.
In the late 1950s tiny utilities banded together to tackle the
giant new nuclear technology and the ``Yankee'' system began. The
26-year-old Maine Yankee reactor in Wiscasset has eight owners;
ownership of Vermont Yankee, Connecticut Yankee and Yankee Rowe in
Massachusetts was also shared. Now giant conglomerates want to
manage strings of tiny reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Bornemann and Brewer, together with Timothy Smith, a former
industry lobbyist, made a bid late last month for Maine Yankee,
which has been on the market two years. The three said they would
run it as a ``merchant'' plant, selling its power to whomever
wanted it that hour, that week or that month, like a taxi in a
field previously served only by private cars. Many companies have
built merchant plants that run on natural gas or coal. No one is
likely to build a nuclear plant, but existing reactors could be
sold by utilities and become merchant plants.
</P>
<P>
   Their bid came too late. The consortium that owns the plant
recently hired Stone &AMP; Webster, which built it, to tear it down.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's prediction might have sounded outlandish years ago. But
last month the first-ever sale of an operating reactor was
completed; the undamaged twin of the Three Mile Island reactor that
melted down near Harrisburg, Pa., in March 1979, was bought by
Amerigen, a consortium of Philadelphia Electric and British Energy.
</P>
<P>
   But it will have competition. ``We've said for a number of years
we'd like to be an operator,'' said Cyril Guerrera, a spokesman for
Entergy, which is based in New Orleans and supplied Maine Yankee's
most recent managers. It already owns five reactors, and Entergy
recently said it wanted to buy reactors, or at least shares in
them. Deregulation enables the companies to collect some of their
losses from their customers, and may spur them to sell cheap,
partly because the cost of decommissioning reactors is huge.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long criticized the American nuclear program for
having too many companies, each running too few plants to get any
economies of scale or skill. Now the programs seem to face the kind
of consolidation that has transformed everything from grocery
stores to cable television companies. However it occurs,
consolidation could be good for consumers, say people inside the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Fontes, the assistant general manager at the Northern
California Power Agency, which represents 15 small utilities that
buy their power wholesale, disagreed. When one company owns most of
the generation in an area, he said, ``prices will reflect the
owners desires more than the market demand.''

WHAT'S SO FREE ABOUT DUTY FREE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)

Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

<P>
   Duty free belongs with free lunch and free love as another
phantom freebie. As a phrase, it sounds as if it sprang from the
fertile mind of some marketing genius. As a concept, it is in fact
a morass where questions of import duties are tangled with domestic
luxury taxes, all of which may be undone elsewhere by regulations
to safeguard crops and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Duty-free shopping can sometimes leave even veteran travelers
wondering where they went astray.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine you are leaving a country _ theirs or yours. Tickets in
hand, you hasten through the metal detector. Just beyond the
security barrier is a souk whose merchants have set up cupboards of
liquor and sprayed the air with French perfume, spreading their
rugs under the ``duty free'' banner. Sure enough, you can buy
merchandise without paying any duty, but only because you are
departing, purchases in hand, and the country at your back has no
way to nick you. So much for the ``duty'' part.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when you reach your next stop is another matter,
governed by what that country wants to tax or keep out, which can
depend on what products the country makes, or the state of its
agriculture. Unless you know the tax and agriculture rules, your
purchase may be subject to duty or even sales tax, seized, or, if
it is edible, ground to oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Al Michaud of Tryon, N.C., was returning to the United States
from Amsterdam this spring when he said a delicious-looking salami
at the Schiphol duty-free shop ``rang my gastric bell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A salesclerk assured me that all was inspected and entry into
the U.S. would be no problem,'' Michaud said. ``At Customs in
Detroit, my salami was confiscated with many a tsk and harrumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaud avoided a fine because he had entered the salami on his
Customs declaration. But according to the Agriculture Department
inspectors at New York's Kennedy Airport, concealers of salami, or
other forbidden viands, who lie and act uncooperative can be fined
a maximum of $250. So much for the ``free'' part.
</P>
<P>
   Duty-free shops are big business for their owners, and for
airports that charge them rent linked to sales. Worldwide,
according to David Bernstein, president of the International
Association of Airport Duty Free Shops, the annual revenue in such
shops is $22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes, liquor, perfume, watches and cosmetics are standard
commodities in these shops; outside the airport their prices
include sin taxes or other excise taxes. Cameras are no longer
major items because shoppers can buy them at equivalent discount
prices in the city, said Helen Deknatel, commercial director of
shops at the International Arrivals Terminal at Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Because the duty-free shops' merchandise will not be drunk,
smoked or resold in the country, tax authorities waive their
percentage, which lowers the price _ although, again, duty has
nothing to do with it. Until they are sold, such goods, whether
Marlboro, Jack Daniel's or Cutty Sark, are stored ``in bond,''
meaning the management guarantees that they won't enter the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
   Most travelers don't have a clue what they are allowed to carry
with them. Michael Halper, who operates seven duty-free shops at
Kennedy Airport, said that a recent customer on his way to Israel
bought a five-carton carrier of Marlboro cigarettes ($63.80 at last
check) but was unaware that the limit was 250 cigarettes to a
visitor. When the customer returned from Israel to complain, Halper
made good on the loss, as Schiphol did for Michaud when he wrote,
enclosing the receipt for his salami.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion are the other shops in the airport.
Unlike the duty-free stores, they do not require passengers to
present an overseas ticket and they charge regular prices,
including local sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Halper says the magical phrase duty free lures customers but
convenience and price make the business thrive. It is convenient
not having to lug a bottle of whisky from home to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison shopping is still a good idea. Bourbon drinkers can
buy a liter of Jim Beam for about $11 at a duty-free shop at
Kennedy Airport, compared with about $14 in New York City. In
Britain, the home of scotch, tariffs run the price of the
American-produced Jim Beam up to about $31 a liter in a London
supermarket; local brown liquor, Bell's Scotch Whiskey, costs only
$23 a liter. So it pays to pack one's own when traveling to
Britain, and a liter of bourbon slides duty free through British
Customs. Travelers to Italy, on the other hand, need not bother to
take bourbon; Italians, who have no competing product, sell it at
roughly the same price as in America.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the salami syndrome that drives people batty. An
American traveler sees pate in a duty-free shop overseas, and the
price is better than an identical tin at home. She buys it, and on
arrival at home, she declares her food product. Zap! The pate joins
Michaud's sausage in the doom machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department says the pate imported into the
country in bulk for sale is processed by methods that have been
officially inspected and accepted. Not so the little tin from the
duty-free shop. What's the solution? Eat the pate on the plane
coming home.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Breezy and cooler conditions will continue to spread across the
Northwestern States as a strong cold front moves into the northern
Rockies. Brisk onshore winds will promote clouds and showers near
the Washington coast and along the western slopes of the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the front, a few potent thunderstorms will develop in
the warm air over the Bitterroots as well as the higher terrain of
northern Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will have seasonal heat with ample sunshine,
although thundershowers will form near many mountain peaks during
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Very humid air will surge into the northern parts of the Plains
and Mississippi Valley as winds from the south increase ahead of a
cold front. Broken bands of strong thunderstorms, some with
damaging winds and hail, will develop from the eastern Dakotas to
the central Missouri River Valley during the afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
   A weak front will stall near the northern Appalachians leaving
most of the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States humid with
variable clouds. Clusters of strong thunderstorms will develop
around a disturbance as it drifts from the southern Appalachians to
the Middle Atlantic Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, a few showers will develop east of the Appalachians,
especially in the afternoon. In the wake of the front, the eastern
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley will be mainly sunny.
</P>
<P>
   Slow-moving thunderstorms will erupt near the western Gulf of
Mexico coast. Meanwhile, most of the Southeast will be sultry with
scattered thunder.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SEARING SUMMER
</P>
<P>
   The arid, searing summer of 1998 in Texas is reaching historic
proportions around Brownsville. The period from March to the middle
of August has had only 0.97 inches of rain, the driest on record at
the southern Texas town. The average temperature of 87.3 made the
first month of summer the hottest June since records began. July
was the third hottest on record with each day achieving a
temperature of 90 degrees or greater. There have now been five
consecutive years when every day in July has reached 90 or higher,
an unprecedented event in Brownsville where records began in 1878. &QL;

   WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. _ The tranquil shore of Wheatfields Lake, a
high-country fishing hole set among the ponderosa and sandstone
here on the Navajo Reservation, would seem an unlikely place to
encounter violence.
</P>
<P>
   But a 26-year-old Navajo man who called himself Bam Bam was
prepared for the worst, filling his battered pickup truck with gas
before setting off with his brother to catch some trout.
</P>
<P>
   Too many times, Bam Bam said, gang rivals had beaten him while
he was walking home in the dark. In a few other instances, said Bam
Bam, speaking on the condition that he be identified only by his
nickname, he had done the attacking and had served time in jail for
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten almost like the inner city here,'' said Bam Bam,
unzipping his jacket to show a pistol hidden inside.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of violent crime here on the Navajo Reservation, a
vast territory of dry plains and red rock mesas in the Four Corners
region of the Southwest, reflects problems on dozens of the
nation's Indian reservations. While homicide and assault rates have
declined across much of the nation in recent years, they have
soared in Indian country to rival that of the nation's cities.
</P>
<P>
   As the influences of the modern world grow, many reservations _
especially those in the West _ suffer from problems with gangs and
drugs. The situation is compounded by the poverty that has
afflicted many Indian reservations for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids have satellite TV and are influenced by things going
on in Chicago and New York,'' said Leonard Butler, chief of the
Navajo Nation Police Department of 280 for the reservation's
200,000 residents. ``They go to Los Angeles and bring back the way
of life of the city, like drive-by shootings, graffiti and
tattoos.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the surge in violent crime on reservations,
President Clinton proposed increasing the 1999 law-enforcement
budget for the Bureau of Indian Affairs by $25 million, to $100
million. That total was reduced significantly in recent House and
Senate votes, and by time the appropriation bill emerges from a
conference committee the increase could be below $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are also considering reorganizing the
law-enforcement division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. One
option _ criticized by some tribes and praised by others _ would be
to transfer the responsibility for law enforcement to the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Navajo Reservation has always had its share of
violent crime, but that increased sharply in the mid-1990s.
Homicides went from an average of 35 a year at the beginning of the
decade to 67 in 1996, and 57 the year after. In the first half of
1998, 18 people have been slain on the reservation, dropping the
homicide rate closer to what it was early in the decade. In 1997,
Washington had a murder rate of 55 per 100,000 population,
Baltimore and Detroit had rates of 46 while Chicago had a murder
rate of 27.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is similar on some smaller reservations, like the
Fort Peck Reservation in eastern Montana. There, the murder rate of
1 for 675 residents in 1995 was twice that of New Orleans,
according to a federal report last year on Indian law enforcement.
New Orleans, with 1 murder per 1,350 residents in 1995, has one of
the highest homicide rates in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Combating the crime wave is proving especially difficult because
of a lack of police officers on many reservations in the West,
experts say. For example, there are 1.4 officers per thousand
Navajo residents, compared with 2.9 per thousand for other small
communities, the federal report said. The Navajo Reservation is
primarily dependent on federal money.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of officers was apparent here over two recent
nights, when the officers intervened in drunken domestic fights,
hospitalized a man who drank antifreeze and arrested about a
half-dozen people on charges of public intoxication. Because only
three officers are on duty for evening shifts in a district of
3,055 square miles that includes Window Rock, where the
reservation's government is based, some calls for assistance went
unanswered for hours. There are seven police districts on the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we need more police officers,'' said Officer Roanna
Buck, ``but that's up to the politicians. The tribal leadership is
overlooking the crime because they don't want to admit that it's
happening.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another disparity frequently cited by the police is the lack of
equipment, such as helicopters and computers mounted in squad cars,
commonly found in police departments of comparable size to the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Many reservation residents are frustrated. Seated in a round
hogan, a traditional Navajo home built with logs that has a red
dirt floor, Lorraine Nelson, 60, a teacher from Window Rock,
recalled an earlier era when children spent their days herding
sheep and assisting the tribe rather than getting in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's kids have lost respect for their parents and their
neighbors,'' she said. ``I don't know how to turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   A dilapidated housing project in Fort Defiance, a few miles
north of Window Rock, is considered by many residents to be one of
the most dangerous neighborhoods on the reservation. The barren
lots and graffiti-covered houses are the territory of the Cobras, a
gang of young men whose members battle their rivals, the Dragons,
with baseball bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay strong we had to band together,'' said a 24-year-old
Navajo gang member who uses the name Strange. ``It was more for fun
at first, but then people took it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   But gang violence does not fully explain the reservation's
predicament. Often, people are killed by family members or friends
in petty disputes, often involving alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the Navajo police force has implemented
programs intended to curtail crime. For example, 45 officers were
added to the force. Their salaries were paid with new federal
grants, though the police chief complained that the money did not
supply the uniforms and patrol cars needed for them.
</P>
<P>
   The department also has a gang unit, a community policing
program and school programs intended to discourage children from
using illegal drugs. The tribal leadership and other community
leaders have begun summer work programs for young people and, in
some cases, are evicting problem families from public housing.
</P>
<P>
   But if such efforts are to succeed, the police say, they will
have to reach boys like the three, ages 13 and 14, who were
relaxing on a housing project porch on a recent afternoon. As one
of their mothers sewed inside the house, the boys spoke admiringly
of drug dealing and violence by two older relatives who are gang
members and contemplated joining the gang one day themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As the investigation into President Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky heads toward a pivotal intersection Monday with the
president's testimony to a grand jury, a semantic wrinkle has
emerged. Just what ARE ``sexual relations?'' Whether the president
and Ms. Lewinsky had them depends on the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, a clip-and-save road map for the murky verbal terrain
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   THE PAULA JONES LAWSUIT. For the purposes of her dismissed
sexual harassment claim against the president, sexual relations
were defined as ``contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast,
inner thigh or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or
gratify the sexual desire of any person.'' By a literal reading,
that definition would not embrace the passive partner in oral sex,
who could say truthfully that he had not had sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   THE LEGAL VIEW. There is no generic legal definition of sexual
relations, the description of which depends on the context of a
given case _ civil or criminal, sexual harassment or rape _ and the
specific statutes wherever the case resides, according to Elizabeth
Schneider, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and expert on gender
and law.
</P>
<P>
   THE DICTIONARY. The third edition of Webster's New World
Dictionary does not include an entry for ``sexual relations,'' but
the definition of the noun ``sex'' includes ``anything connected
with sexual gratification or reproduction or the urge for these.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION. Bill Merrell, a spokesman for
the organization's executive committee, said participation in any
type of activity that involves the touching of one partner's
genitals for pleasure would qualify as sexual relations _ and would
be forbidden between the unmarried by Baptists. As for the
suggestion that the passive partner's experience could be
considered something other than sexual, Merrell said, ``It is
astounding to me that anyone of a rational mind and with any
experience as an adult could say that.''
</P>
<P>
   THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY OF HUMAN SEXUALITY IN SAN
FRANCISCO. Dr. Ted McIlvenna, the institute's president, said
sexual relations encompass any part of the process through which an
individual, having experienced the stirrings of desire, negotiates
a satisfaction of that urge. The negotiation, he added, can be
solitary. ``You can have sexual relations with yourself,''
McIlvenna said.

1997 DONATIONS TO UNITED WAY INCREASE FROM PREVIOUS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Fla., Hawaii, N.C., N.Y., Ohio, Tenn., Texas, Va.)  (js) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1,300 local United Ways raised $3.4 billion last year, a 4.7
percent increase over the $3.25 billion raised in 1996 and the
second year in a row that giving to the nation's largest private
funder of social services charities has increased significantly
faster than the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making real gains that show confidence in United Way,''
Betty Stanley Beene, president of United Way of America in
Alexandria, Va., said on Thursday. United Way plans to officially
release the figures on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increases last year and in 1996, when the value of
gifts is adjusted for inflation, donations are still 7.6 percent
below the $3.68 billion donated in 1991. In 1992, the president of
United Way of America, William Aramony, was dismissed and later
imprisoned for embezzling charitable money.
</P>
<P>
   Among large United Ways only one, the United Way of New York
City, has not reported the results of the fund-raising drives that
ended on June 30. Officials could not be reached late Friday or on
Saturday morning, but the organization has not posted any new
information about its campaign on its Web site since April. An
official said last month that donations appeared to be running 8
percent ahead of the previous year. Inflation grew at a rate of
about 1 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 75 largest United Ways, which raise $10 million or
more annually, the largest increases in giving were reported by
Austin, Texas, up 25 percent to $10 million; Charlotte, N.C., up
21.5 percent to $26.5 million; Miami, up 20.5 percent to $32.8
million, and Wilmington, Del., up 17.6 percent to $25.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the largest United Ways, in Chattanooga, Tenn., and
Honolulu, reported declines, both of nearly 5 percent. And
donations rose by less than the rate of inflation at only six
others _ White Plains and Buffalo in New York; Cleveland and Dayton
in Ohio; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in Delaware is significant because donations fell
sharply in the middle of the decade when that United Way embraced
donor option, in which supporters can designate which charities
receive money deducted from their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround last year came after the United Way in Delaware
kept the donor option but stopped promoting it, and instead focused
on its role of providing operating support for crucial agencies
like Boys and Girls Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the national growth, United Way lagged behind the growth
in donations to all charities last year.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel in New York
last month estimated that overall giving increased by more than 6
percent to $143.5 billion last year. The rise was led by an
increase of more than 10 percent, to $13.4 billion, in grants made
by foundations, whose assets have swelled in the longstanding bull
market.
</P>
<P>
   Giving by individuals last year increased nearly 6 percent to
slightly more than $109 billion, virtually identical to the growth
in individual donations in 1996. While United Ways trailed behind
this increase, they did much better than charities in the arts,
culture and humanities, which saw a 3 percent decline in donations,
according to Giving USA.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What may be a significant shift in giving patterns shows up in
the details of the United Way reports and in IRS data cited by
Giving USA.
</P>
<P>
   Historically the poorest Americans have been the most generous,
donating a share of their incomes that is twice as large as that
given by the middle class and the wealthy. Donations to churches,
synagogues and mosques account for most of the giving by the poor.
But preliminary data from 1996 income tax returns, from an economic
model and from United Way's analysis of donations suggest that
giving by the affluent is rising, while donations by those who earn
modest incomes are declining.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita giving by individuals who do not itemize deductions
on their tax returns is slowly declining, according to an annual
report by Independent Sector, an association of more than 1,000
foundations, corporate giving programs and large charities.
</P>
<P>
   Giving USA, published by the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel, said that individuals who itemize deductions
on their tax returns took 12.4 percent more charitable deductions
in 1996, the latest year for which preliminary data are available,
than in 1995. This means income tax deductions for charitable
giving grew nearly twice as fast as overall giving.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beene said that gifts of $1,000 or more rose nearly 19
percent and now account for nearly one-fifth of United Way
donations. &QL;

TOWN ON SHAKY GROUND IS SEEING A TURNAROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ Postcard views of snow-covered peaks,
sparkling lakes and emerald pine forests surround this resort town
7,800 feet up in the Eastern Sierra. But to the dismay of
residents, when the nation's attention is drawn to their town next
to the Mammoth Mountain ski resort, it most often focuses on what
is going on underground.
</P>
<P>
   The town of about 5,000 people sits in the Long Valley Caldera,
a 20-mile-long volcanic basin. After four magnitude-6 earthquakes
struck the area in 1980, geologists found that new inflows of
magma, miles underground, had caused a bulge in the caldera
surface, which sometimes signals a volcanic eruption.
</P>
<P>
   The result for years afterward: news reports that residents
complain exaggerated the risk of an eruption and that damaged the
town's economy and real-estate values.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news media has just devastated this community,'' said
Rodger Guffey, who has owned a Mammoth Lakes restaurant for 28
years. ``If somebody makes a statement, they just use the half that
says we're going to blow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently things have turned around, in part because of the
resurgence of the Southern California economy. In addition,
Intrawest Corp., a resort developer, bought 52 percent of Mammoth
Mountain Ski Area along with real estate in the town and has plans
for $350 million in projects here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a lot of looking into everything,'' said an Intrawest
spokeswoman, Pam Murphy. ``They didn't see it as a big risk at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Intrawest and others are investing despite the fact that the
town continues to be rocked by earthquakes so often that a
television station broadcasts a daily earthquake report.
</P>
<P>
   Last November the area was rattled by a swarm of earthquakes
centered inside the caldera, including almost a thousand in a
single day. That and other swarms that have struck are related to
the volcanic unrest, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Farrar, a Geological Survey hydrologist studying
volcanic phenomena here, said, ``If you had a large earthquake, it
could cause a ground fracture of considerable size and open a
pathway that could allow magma to come to the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's scientists said that the area around Mammoth Lakes
and around the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest were the two
places in the continental United States most likely to produce a
volcanic eruption. But they cannot predict when an eruption will
happen or how severe it might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upshot is that the odds of something happening in any
given year are roughly one in a few hundred,'' said David Hill, a
Geological Survey seismologist. ``It's typical of the geologic
hazards of living on the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   But because there has never been a serious injury or even much
damage from the earthquakes here, and because the last volcanic
eruption in the area occurred 250 years ago, most residents feel
secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are willing to gamble quite a bit on the 99 percent
chance that something is going to go their way,'' Farrar said.
``But the more years that go by with periods of increased activity
and no eruption, pretty soon you're going to get to the point where
the earth system is ready to produce an eruption, and that's what
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of talk that angers many residents, who are far
more fearful of renewed damage to the economy from media attention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mayor Kirk Stapp of Mammoth Lakes said: ``Some people in Mammoth
are absolutely hysterical about defending the town. They're very
hostile _ some people's livelihood is at stake and they become very
emotional and very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Their cause has not been helped by a series of strong
earthquakes since June, including two of magnitude 5.3. And in
recent years, a new problem has seeped up through the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In about 100 acres at the base of Mammoth Mountain, carbon
dioxide gas released by underground magma has emerged and collected
in soil, killing swaths of pine trees. The gas can collect at high
concentrations in depressions in dirt or snow in that area, and can
be dangerous to anyone breathing below ground or snow level, Farrar
said. &QL;

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When my son Gregory writes his ``What I did over my
summer vacation'' essay this fall, it will be pretty easy. He went
to school.
</P>
<P>
   We live in Japan, and his American-style international school
ended the school year at the beginning of June. But Japanese
elementary schools stay in session until late July, so we enrolled
him in the local elementary school for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the mornings he set off in his yellow school cap, his black
backpack (girls have red backpacks, boys have black ones), his name
badge, his red ``tablecloth'' to cover his desk during lunch, his
miniature piano for music class, and a mountain of books. The
children are supposed to take all their schoolbooks home with them
each day, as an inducement to crack them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fundamental distinctions of Japanese life is ``soto''
versus ``uchi'' _ outside and inside, them and us, and one could
see the distinctions developing even in the first grade. The school
class is enormously tight-knit, and the children are constantly
taught to think of themselves as members of a larger unit. Indeed,
to encourage the sense of belonging, a school class typically stays
together for at least two years, with the same students and the
same teacher for two grades in a row.
</P>
<P>
   For Gregory, the entire universe revolved around Miss Ikeda's
first grade classroom. If one wants to find the roots of Japanese
business habits, where men wear uniforms of dark suits to work and
ignore their families and socialize entirely with their colleagues,
the schools are a good place to start. Children form the same kind
of bond with their peers, focusing their lives on school chums
rather than neighbors or families, and the cohesive force is as
much a presence in daily life as gravity: After a week, Gregory was
rummaging through his clothes drawer and saying that instead of
jeans he wanted to wear shorts like his school friends.
</P>
<P>
   This may indeed stunt individuality, as many Japanese
commentators believe, and it may exert pressure on kids who stick
out. One boy hassled and pinched Gregory, apparently in part
because he was different. On the other hand, the sense of teamwork
is very impressive, and the distrust of ``soto,'' or outside, did
not prevent first grade girls from forming a crush on Gregory,
probably because he was different.
</P>
<P>
   I was walking along the sidewalk once with Gregory and a car
driving by came to a screeching halt beside us. A little girl in
the back seat rolled down her window and yelled frantically,
``Gregory! Gregory! Hi there, Gregory!'' He looked at her as if she
had girl germs and marched on, probably breaking her heart _ and no
doubt leaving her mom, who was driving the car, thinking that
American education tends to stunt the friendliness of children.
</P>
<P>
   We were in for some surprises from the first day of Miss Ikeda's
class. Above all, despite all the talk about Japanese schools
stunting individuality, the Japanese system went to far greater
lengths to teach individual responsibility. When Gregory entered
his class for the first time, he had to stand in front and
introduce himself to the class. On the next day, he had to
introduce himself to the entire student body at the morning meeting
on the playground. The teacher coached him on how to bow and shout
out: ``My name is Gregory Kristof, and I am a first grader. I would
be grateful if you would help me out.''
</P>
<P>
   It should have been a terrifying experience, but it was not. The
atmosphere was gentle, so that it was obvious that if Gregory
messed up, that was fine too. When Gregory stepped into his first
grade class and looked around wide-eyed at 37 faces, his
self-introduction was little more than a whisper, without much of a
bow. Yet Miss Ikeda simply thanked him warmly and asked another
student to show him his seat and answer any questions that came up.
</P>
<P>
   That use of students to help others and fill adult-like roles is
also a hallmark of Japanese schools. There are no janitors, for the
students themselves have a daily cleaning time when they scrub the
floors and windows and toilets. There is no cafeteria, and students
themselves bring the food from a preparation room and serve it to
other children.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's proudest week was when he was on the ``lunch duty''
and he got to wear a white uniform and cap and was let out with a
few others to bring the food and serve it. While I raved about the
idea of kids cleaning the schools, however, Gregory was less
impressed by the ``Honorable Cleaning,'' as it is called in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring,'' he protested. ``I don't think it's a good
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise, though, came when we asked what time we
should pick Gregory up after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the kids walk home by themselves,'' a teacher explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's only a first grader. Surely all the kids don't go
home by themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes. We encourage them to walk to and from school on their
own. It builds independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, all the Japanese children walk to and from school
by themselves, and a few even take buses or the subway if their
school is far away. Most go with friends, but many walk on their
own. This is of course possible only in a country with safe
streets, but still the sight of six-year-olds emerging from the
subway to go to school tended to undermine the stereotype of Japan
as a country where children are robots who are incapable of
individual activity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the notion that Japanese schools stifle creativity
took a blow when I saw that all the children learn to play the
piano. Music and art are a much more important part of the
curriculum in Japan than in the United States, and they are one
facet of creative expression.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the math teaching used story problems and other
methods to drive home the principles of what they were learning.
Instead of simply doing addition drills, for example, Miss Ikeda
would call out a number, and the children would have to shout out
how many more would equal ten. So if she called out six, the class
was supposed to answer with a chorus of ``four.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, my impression of Japanese elementary school was
excellent. There was far more teaching of math and of reading and
writing than would be the case in most American schools _ Gregory
now reads better in Japanese than in English _ and it seemed that
this was in part a function of Japan simply taking primary
education more seriously than America does.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, although Americans view themselves as modernists,
it is the United States that sticks with an anachronism like a
school year based on an agricultural society, in which children
take off for the summer to help with farmwork. Until recently Japan
was an agricultural country, but it saw its future in education
rather than fieldwork, and so children go to school in the summer.
They do have a month-long summer vacation, but during that time
they must write a daily journal and do other homework. The result
is that fall does not need to be spent repeating what was taught
the previous spring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, teachers in Japan are first rate, are paid
excellent wages and enjoy high prestige. Moreover, Japanese
children benefit from the gender discrimination that Japanese women
suffer: It is difficult for the smartest women to become doctors or
lawyers in Japan, so while brilliant American women become brain
surgeons or university professors, brilliant Japanese women often
become elementary school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Year-round school and first-rate teachers are expensive, of
course, but Japan views those as essentials and cuts corners in
other areas. Aside from the lack of cafeterias and janitors, there
is no air conditioning and buildings are old and rudimentary.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, classes are large _ nearly 40 pupils in Gregory's
first grade class _ and they function only because so much of the
responsibility is assigned to the students themselves. Gregory's
Japanese is fluent but not native level, and so when he did not
understand something, a boy named Kubori-kun was detailed to
explain it to him, the idea being that this would help both of
them.
</P>
<P>
   All this school sounds as if it would be all work and no play,
and indeed the average child in Asia has had one to two more years
in a classroom by the time he or she enters junior high than the
average American child. But the saving grace was a boisterous
emphasis on fun in the classroom. Kids were always shouting and
clowning around, with none of the discipline that people assume is
drilled into them, and the student-teacher ratio was so large that
the classroom was mostly on the lip of chaos. That had
disadvantages, of course, but it seemed to mean lots of fun for the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there was recess _ lots of it _ and most of the
children seemed to enjoy the recess with their friends so much that
they were willing to put up with the additional classroom time.
</P>
<P>
   So Gregory had a great time. In the end he prefers his
international school, because he feels more natural studying in
English, but he said that despite the long hours most of the pupils
had more fun in the Japanese school.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``The recess,'' Gregory explained. ``There's lots of recess. And
that's the best thing about school.''

   As the Dow Trembles, Small Investors Stand Firm
</P>
<P>
   It's been a disconcerting summer for investors. Wild swings in
share prices sent the Dow Jones industrial average to 9,337.97 in
mid-July, but since then stocks have been plummeting on fears about
the worsening economic crisis in Asia and evidence that U.S.
corporate profits are on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Dow sank another 173 points, to 8,425 _ its
lowest level since February.
</P>
<P>
   Few investors can make sense of the recent whipsawing stock
prices, but a survey of market watchers suggests that large
institutional investors, like hedge funds, are behind most of the
summer's anxious selling, which has pushed volume up to record
levels in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   Individual investors have been a nervous group, but also a quiet
one. They have not flooded telephone lines at mutual fund
companies, and their silence seems to suggest that they have not
yet called it quits.

   Swiss Banks Reach Accord
</P>
<P>
   After years of bitter dispute, Switzerland's leading banks
settled a lawsuit with victims of the Nazi era who had accused them
of improperly retaining their assets. The banks agreed to pay $1.25
billion to claimants in the class-action suit _ people who survived
the Holocaust and the heirs of those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which began as three separate lawsuits in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn, involved assets that the plaintiffs
said had either been deposited in the banks by victims of Nazi
persecution or had been looted by the Nazis and stored in the
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Many details remain to be worked out, including who is eligible
for the money _ estimates ranged last week from tens of thousands
to hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   The banks are UBS, recently formed by the merger of Union Bank
of Switzerland and Swiss Bank, and Credit Suisse.

   Bell Atlantic Workers Return

   Two days after walking off the job, 73,000 Bell Atlantic
employees returned to work on Tuesday after reaching a tentative
two-year agreement with management that guarantees that union
members will install and maintain the high-technology
communications systems now being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Facing intense competition from nonunionized telecommunications
companies, Bell Atlantic was under pressure to settle the strike,
which was already inconveniencing customers. The company also
agreed to phase out hundreds of customer service jobs now being
performed by nonunion personnel in Hampton, Va., and return them to
union workers.

   Internet Privacy Deal

   When new members fill out an online application form for the

personal information about education, income, occupation and
personal interests.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Geocities promised on the site's registration
page: ``We will not share this information with anyone without your
permission.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Trade Commission found that Geocities had misled
more than two million subscribers by passing the information to
advertisers and others. In the federal government's first
Internet-privacy enforcement action, the FTC approved a settlement
with Geocities under which the site has to disclose how it intends
to use the personal information it collects.

   No Caribbean Secession
</P>
<P>
   The principle of self-determination was tested on a tiny scale
when the 10,000 people who live on the Caribbean island of Nevis
voted on a proposal to secede from federation with their 36,000
neighbors on nearby St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   Although 62 percent voted to split from what is already the
smallest country in the Western Hemisphere, a two-thirds majority
was required to achieve independence. That means Nevisians will not
join the likes of Tuvalu and Nauru in the United Nations _ at least
not for the moment, since the country's constitution permits Nevis
to try again any time it wishes.

   New Help for Clinton

   President Clinton is running the meter on his lawyers' clocks
this weekend by preparing for his grand jury testimony Monday. But
he can take comfort in knowing that his new legal defense fund has
raised more than $2 million in just six months.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Legal Expense Trust has far exceeded expectations,
enriched mostly by an increase in the annual limit from $1,000 to
$10,000 and anger among the president's supporters at Independent

   Clinton and his wife, Hillary, owe an estimated $6 million to
their private lawyers, and could owe as much as $10 million by
2001. ``There is a well-financed group of zealots who want to bring
down the president,'' said entertainment mogul David Geffen. ``And
this guy has no money. He's broke.''

   Young Killers Are Punished
</P>
<P>
   In the photographs, the two boys looked alarmingly normal _
except for the chains and handcuffs. But as an Arkansas judge
ordered Mitchell Johnson, 14, and Andrew Golden, 12, to a juvenile
detention center for killing four students and a teacher in a
school shooting spree in Jonesboro last March, a single question
seemed to scream out from those photos: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were going to shoot over their heads,'' Mitchell
said, while Andrew pleaded temporary insanity. Mitchell's father
said his son ``doesn't have an answer.'' The slain teacher's
husband will wait: he asked the boys to ``tell us why'' someday.

   Reprieve for Globe Columnist
</P>
<P>
   The columnist Mike Barnicle was granted a reprieve by the
management of The Boston Globe. Barnicle's original offense _ an
Aug. 2 column with jokes that paralleled those in a book by
comedian George Carlin _ was compounded when the columnist, who
told his editors that he had never read the book, was shown in a
videotape recommending it to television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The first offense drew a one-month suspension; after the
videotape surfaced, Globe editor Matthew Storin asked for
Barnicle's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   That decision prompted criticism from Barnicle's supporters,
including advertisers and subscribers. After meeting with the
columnist, Storin and publisher Benjamin Taylor decided instead on
a two-month suspension without pay.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was greeted with jubilation by some, but 50
employees in the newsroom of The Globe, which is owned by The New
York Times Co., sent a petition saying, ``Barnicle's reprieve gives
the appearance of a double standard that allows one individual to
ignore journalistic principles other reporters must follow.''

   Jagger &AMP; Co. Play Moscow, Finally
</P>
<P>
   Better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Russian rock-and-roll fans were saying last week as
they watched with awe and nostalgia as a middle-aged Mick Jagger
pranced and pirouetted across the stage of a Moscow sports arena,
playing the songs of their youth.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 30 years since Russians first heard hits by the
``Rollingi,'' as the Rolling Stones are known here.
</P>
<P>
   In those dys, back in the now-collapsed U.S.S.R, hits like
``Satisfaction'' and ``Jumping Jack Flash'' were furtive thrills
for Soviet teen-agers who had to engage in illegal ``speculation''
just to buy a smuggled LP. More likely, they listened to bad copies
made on reel-to-reel tapes, or on used X-ray film ingeniously
transformed into disposable records.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that Jagger's face is creased with wrinkles, or
that Charlie Watts' hair has gone white. After all, their loyal
fans didn't look like spring chickens either.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough just to see the group perform with all the gusto
those old records had conveyed, to watch them put on a world-class
show, full of colored lights, glitter and puffs of smoke. That was
all it took to make Russia's 30- and 40-somethings feel they had at
long last shared an experience that their generation the world over
has taken for granted: a chance to see the Stones, live and in
concert.
</P>
<P>
   So what's 30 years? Nothing if in the end you can get what you
want.

   Popcorn, Peanuts and Valentino
</P>
<P>
   Baseball traditionalists will tell you that fans come to ball
parks for the pastoral experience, the clout of a mighty home run,
an intense face-off between a flame-throwing righthander and a
Bunyanesque hitter or the work ethic of a player who never sits out
a game.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball owners have discovered yet another lure: Beanie
Babies. Teams that give away the cuddly bean-bag animals with names
like Peanut, Glory and Valentino have found that these little toys
possess the awesome power to produce sellouts nearly every time
they're offered.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Inc., the Beanies' manufacturer, never planned for its
animals, which are sold at specialty retailers, to become baseball
giveaways. A Chicago Cubs marketing executive, curious about one of
his daughter's Beanies, Cubbie the bear, persuaded Ty to plunge
into baseball.
</P>
<P>
   When 23,000 Valentinos (he's a bear) were given away at Yankee
Stadium in May, 49,820 people showed up. The Beanies, and their new
owners, watched the Yankees' David Wells pitch a perfect game. And
when Stretch the ostrich was given away last Sunday, the House that
Ruth Built drew 55,911.
</P>
<P>
   The Beanies have become so valuable _ collectors have priced
Peanut the blue elephant, now discontinued, as high as $5,200 _
that teams need extra security to guard them. Not even Mark
McGwire, who may break Roger Maris' single season home run record
of 61, is guarded as such precious cargo.

RISKS ABOUND IN HOWEVER CLINTON TESTIFIES, LEGAL EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-POLITICS, CLINTON-KENDALL.) 
(nk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veteran prosecutors of perjury cases and professors of law see
legal risks for President Clinton whether he continues to say he
did not have sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky or acknowledges
a certain kind of sexual contact and tries to reconcile it with his
earlier testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, these legal experts said, there is a large
element of the surreal in the president's situation. The way the
case stands now, most agree, as a matter of both law and practice,
it is highly unlikely that any ordinary citizen would face charges
of perjury or obstruction of justice on the basis of the deposition
in the Jones case. Nor can the grand jury investigating the matter
actually level such charges against Clinton while he is still in
office, the way most legal scholars read both the Constitution and
the independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet based on the specter of such charges, independent counsel
Kenneth Starr can now question Clinton in a new proceeding, a
federal grand jury, where the legal stakes are much higher, and
where anything he says can be used against him. If Starr has
convincing evidence that a continued denial is false _ including
any DNA evidence that might be obtained from a dress of Ms.
Lewinsky's _ it could make Clinton vulnerable to a much stronger
perjury case.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Amendment _ the right not to be compelled to bear
witness against oneself _ protects citizens against just this kind
of triple bind: Answer falsely, and risk charges of perjury; refuse
to answer, and be jailed for contempt of court; answer truthfully,
and provide prosecutors with ammunition for one's own criminal
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But politically, most observers agree, taking the Fifth _
refusing to answer questions on the grounds the answers would tend
to be self-incriminating _ is not an option for a president,
especially since the official secrecy of grand jury proceedings is
unlikely to hold up against leaks.
</P>
<P>
   H. Richard Uviller, a professor of law at Columbia University,
likened the result to the ``perjury trap'' typically set for
racketeers when he was an assistant district attorney in Manhattan
under Frank Hogan, the best-known prosecutor of his time.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other former prosecutors interviewed, Uviller is
troubled at the idea that the kind of device used to catch mobsters
could force the president of the United States to answer graphic
questions about his private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Others said it was unfair to Starr to say he was only
investigating sex. ``The sex is the subject matter of the lie, but
it's the perjury that's important here,'' countered John Fried,
head of the trial division of the Manhattan District Attorney's
office between 1985 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But Fried, who rejected the term ``perjury trap'' to describe
Starr's tactics, also cringed at the kind of graphic questions
needed to lay the groundwork for a perjury case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was the lack of such questions by the lawyer deposing the
president in the Jones case in January that has left Clinton the
possibility of telling the grand jury that he had sexual encounters
with Ms. Lewinsky, while making a case that he did not testify
falsely. Advisers to the president acknowledged on Thursday that
such a strategy was under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton did not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky,
then, of course, no perjury was committed. But in legal terms,
perjury is not just lying under oath, but knowingly making a false
statement that is material to the inquiry at hand. In this case,
there is considerable doubt that a possible consensual sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was material to the Paula Jones
case, which was dismissed; legally, evidence that goes to character
or credibility is not considered material.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he believed his statements in the Jones deposition to be
false in strict legal terms is also in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   For the purposes of the deposition, the agreed-upon definition
of sexual relations was ``contact with the genitalia, anus, groin,
breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to
arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So the record is completely clear,'' Clinton was asked, ``have
you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is
defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as modified by the court?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton replied: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   But the questions about sex did not go beyond that. A leading
Supreme Court decision on perjury, Bronston vs. United States,
unanimously held in 1973 that although a witness' testimony might
be misleading or evasive, it was the responsibility of the
questioning lawyer to probe, and not to expect a jury to interpret
what the witness meant.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from opening the door to a degrading examination of the
details, Clinton's admitting to sexual encounters now would not be
without its legal perils, several law professors said. It
establishes what the prosecutor might have difficulty proving
beyond a reasonable doubt on his own: that there were sexual acts,
and a motive to hide them.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing that Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had sex is the first
thing a prosecutor has to do to make a case of perjury or
obstruction of justice, noted Douglas Grover, a former federal
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike perjury, the obstruction of justice statute is so broadly
drawn that any endeavor to influence the course of a proceeding, no
matter how immaterial to the inquiry or how unsuccessful, could
constitute obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Though reports are that Ms. Lewinsky has denied that Clinton
instructed her to lie, areas of potential danger might include any
``cover stories'' they are said to have discussed. Here too, if his
intent was to mislead his wife or the public rather than to change
the outcome of the Paula Jones case, Grover said, it is not legally
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Like Professor Uviller at Columbia, Paul Rothstein, a law
professor at Georgetown University, cast about for some middle
ground. ``The best thing is only to answer some of the questions,
or a very fuzzy general mea culpa.''
</P>
<P>
   Others dismissed this middle road out of hand, as well as the
suggestion that Clinton could invoke a constitutional right to
privacy. &QL;

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 16, moved Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-REVIEW _ The world's attention has been focused on Africa
lately because of the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, and because of the extreme suffering of the Sudanese, who
are again on the run from yet another cycle of war between a Muslim
north and a traditionalist and Christian south. But a million other
stories of deprivation and intractable hunger just a notch less
severe never get told because they are so common. By Barbara
Crossette. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HONESTY-REVIEW _ Lying is bad. So Americans say. They tell
pollsters they are no good at it, it is difficult, they rarely lie.
In the tradition of Lake Wobegon (``where the women are strong, the
men are good looking and all of the children are above average''),
they think they are more honest than everyone else. Yet lying is
everywhere: lies to children, lies to voters, lies to the Internal
Revenue Service, lies under oath. People lie to avoid
embarrassment, to spare feelings, to get their way. By Janny
Scott. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS-REVIEW _ If any place can engender a sense of being
permanently dissed, it's Arkansas. Even Mississippi, the nation's
poorest state, at least gets stereotyped in terms of both
Faulknerian complexity and abject redneckery. But dating from a
19th-century best-selling travelogue derisively titled ``On a Slow
Train Through Arkansas'' to H.L. Mencken's ridicule of ``the
miasmic jungles of Arkansas'' to Li'l Abner and Dogpatch, perhaps
no state has had such consistently dismal public relations. By
Peter Applebome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TERRORISM-REVIEW _ As the Clinton administration rushes to
prepare new budget requests to improve the security of American
embassies, officials and experts are increasingly discussing what
may be a more efficient response to terrorism, which is
retaliation. By Steven Erlanger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KIDS-REASON-REVIEW _ At the age of 7, a child is considered by
the Roman Catholic Church to have reached the ``age of reason'' and
is entitled to receive communion. Some evangelical churches hold
that a child of 7 can make an independent spiritual choice. In
Judaism and Islam, a boy of 7 is expected to begin his religious
studies and participate, to some degree, in adult rituals like
fasting and praying. Freud believed the super ego, or the
conscience, developed by age 4 or 5. But is a child of such tender
years a responsible being, capable of telling right from wrong and
accountable, not just legally but morally, for his actions? By
Susan Sachs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLACKS-REVIEW _ According to projections by the Census Bureau,
2005 will be the year that the number of Hispanics residing in the
United States surpasses the black population, the country's largest
minority group. By Steven A. Holmes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHILE-SOCSEC-REVIEW _ Today a lot of conservatives are
proclaiming that a century of increasing government responsibility
for social welfare is over in the West, and aging populations and
dropping birth rates will make pay-as-you-go social security
impossible to sustain even in the United States. So they are
looking at the Chilean solution: privately managed, individually
owned retirement accounts based on the compounded magic of stocks
and bonds, as a replacement. By Clifford Krauss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEAFARING-BOOKS-REVIEW _ What is it about the siren call of the
sea that makes readers want to thumb through a ``cookery book''
like ``Lobscouse &AMP; Spotted Dog'' (Norton, 1998) for recipes for
sweetbreads in malmsey, spotted dog (an eggy custard tinged with
rosewater) and other 18th-century galley fare? Whatever the answer,
there is enough money in seafaring literature these days to prompt
a host of trade publishers to cash in. By Doreen Carvahal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UTILITIES-REVIEW _ States around the country are breaking up
utility monopolies, hoping to create a competitive marketplace for
electricity. But that does not mean the monopolies are
disappearing; some may just be turning sideways, moving away from
vertical operations that controlled coal mines, power stations and
meters and toward a horizontal business that manages huge groups of
generating stations. Leading the turn, some experts predict, will
be nuclear power. By Matthew L. Wald. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DUTY-FREE-REVIEW _ Duty free belongs with free lunch and free
love as another phantom freebie. As a phrase, it sounds as if it
sprang from the fertile mind of some marketing genius. As a
concept, it is in fact a morass where questions of import duties
are tangled with domestic luxury taxes, all of which may be undone
elsewhere by regulations to safeguard crops and livestock.
Duty-free shopping can sometimes leave even veteran travelers
wondering where they went astray. By Betsy Wade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-SCHOOLS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Japan's first-graders: learning
to love school in the summer. There's cleanup. And all that recess.
By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-SEX-REVIEW (Undated) _ Different definitions of `sexual
relations' from various sources. By Frank Bruni.

FOR TWO TEEN-AGE SISTERS, FINAL TRIP TO KENYAN VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KATHERA, Kenya _ A long cortege bore the broken bodies of two
young sisters who died in the American Embassy bombing in Nairobi
up the lush slopes of Mount Kenya to their family's ancestral
village Saturday, far from the charred ruins at the capital's
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The journey began at dawn at a Nairobi mortuary, where their
family gathered to receive the twin coffins of Gloria and Caroline
Mutuiri, aged 16 and 17. They had gone to the embassy eight days
ago hoping for visas to the United States. Their mother, Virginia,
stood at the mortuary's steel doors wrapped in a white shawl of
mourning, saying, ``I have lost my light.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the terrorist bombing, which killed at least
247 Kenyans and 12 Americans, a seismic wave of suffering has
spread over the country. On Saturday, funerals were held all over
Kenya for the dead, some in Nairobi, some in the towns and tribal
villages from where people of all walks of life had come to the
capital to seek their fortunes. The village of Kathera, population
perhaps 500, has been preparing for three days to receive its slain
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   At the mortuary Saturday, Sister Adah Adoyo, who taught the
girls in high school, offered a short homily. Addressing God, she
said, ``We do not know where You are going,'' and concluded, ``We
do not want to pretend that it's an easy journey.''
</P>
<P>
   The caravan pulled out, headed for the girls' home village, 150
miles away. In one car in the long line, two cousins fell to
chatting, consoling themselves with stories of the miseries that
had befallen other people with the bombing _ the boy of 3 who lost
both parents, the friend blinded by flying glass _ and with
memories of Gloria and Caroline.
</P>
<P>
   As the city began falling away, one of the cousins, Wilson
Kinyua Ndambiri, a young chef, remembered the girls, dressed in
lavender gowns, as maids of honor at his wedding one year ago
Saturday. Caroline, he said, was ``perfect in poetry,'' and taped
her favorite verses to her bedroom wall. Gloria, he remembered, was
the queen of her drama class. The girls' father, Barnabas, is a
rich man by Kenyan standards, and Caroline and Gloria had dreams of
studying and working in the United States, which led them to the
American Embassy and their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The road to Kathera rose out of the gray capital and into the
green world. It climbed past eucalyptus and hibiscus and
bougainvillea, past soaring hills and plunging waterfalls. A
wedding party overtook the funeral procession, the newlyweds
weaving in and out of the line of mourners.
</P>
<P>
   The cortege kept heading heavenward, and pines appeared among
the palms. Then the procession turned off the paved road, through
the ripening fruit on display at the lively market day in the town
of Nkubu, and down a rough track. Up the dirt road lay the village
of Kathera, five miles south of the Equator, ringed by plantations
of coffee and tea set in rich ochre earth.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the tiny tin-roofed Ntemwene Methodist Church here was
overflowing. People from the city and the countryside filled the
pews, spilled out a doorway hung with orchids and irises, sat
together on the ground. The service was conducted in English and in
two Kenyan dialects, Kikuyu and Kimeru. It was like any funeral
anywhere, with women hushing babies and weeping in silence.
</P>
<P>
   From memory, in Kimeru, the mourners sang from the Methodist
hymnal ``Hold the Fort,'' ``I am a Pilgrim and a Stranger'' and
``There is a Land of Pure Delight.'' For the first time in a week,
the sun came out.
</P>
<P>
   People rose to speak. One of the girls' many aunts, Nahason
Gitonga, spoke of enduring the unbearable, and said, ``We have no
choice but to keep our legs on the roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadrack Riungu, a lay preacher, pointed to the altar where the
girls' coffins lay shrouded in lace, and said, ``The person who did
this was possessed by the devil, and he must be defeated, in Jesus'
name.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister, the Rev. Thomas Gitobu, spoke at length of death
and resurrection, and said: ``Our minds are troubled. We don't know
what's next. These are days of sorrow, disillusion, despair,
broken-heartedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong women shouldered the coffin from the altar and took it
from the church. A hearse drove a short way down the dirt road to
the Mutuiris' house and farm, planted in tea as far as the eye
could see, and surrounded by palms. Behind the house, at the edge
of the greening tea, was a pile of newly dug earth, from which came
a coolness. The people from the city and the people from the
village gathered round, 300 strong.
</P>
<P>
   And then, singing old English hymns in an older tribal tongue,
they laid the girls in their graves. &QL;

RUMORS AND CONTRADICTIONS FUEL RUSSIA'S MARKET CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As a branch manager of one of Russia's largest banks _
one of the commercial banks rumored to be on the brink of collapse
in the latest wave of Russia's financial crisis _ the young man
with a baby-face was frankly worried.
</P>
<P>
   So were his depositors, who all morning Friday had been coming
in asking to get their money out. Yes, but only in a few days, they
were told. Some pressed further. Had the Central Bank stepped in to
the rescue with a new infusion of credits, as some newspapers had
reported that morning?
</P>
<P>
   The bank manager, who spoke on condition that he and his bank
would not be identified, said that he had not been sure so he put
in a call to the Central Bank of Russia. ``I called the information
service. I called them twice because our clients were asking,'' he
said. ``They told me to read the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   And so goes another Russian crisis, lurching in the dark,
stumbling from rumor to rumor, in a forest of official statements
made and then withdrawn. ``In Russia,'' sighed the young man,
``things are explained to people less, that's why they fear things
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the crisis was still bubbling at a low ebb, with
variations that puzzled the experts, let alone the chronically
uninformed average Russian. Many currency exchange booths in the
capital were posting signs announcing ``No Hard Currency.'' At
others, the price of a dollar had leaped from last week's rate of
6.2 rubles to 7, even 8. Bank after bank stopped releasing dollars,
or limiting the amount their clients could take.
</P>
<P>
   The government, too, was switching gears fast. On Friday,
President Boris Yeltsin said adamantly he would not fuel the
turmoil by breaking up his August vacation, and Prime Minister
Sergei Kiriyenko, keeping to his old pre-crisis schedule, kept
insisting that its roots were purely ``psychological.'' One
newspaper headline said: ``Kiriyenko has a Psychological Crisis.
Everyone Else's is Financial.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, the strategy flipped. After reports of a worried
phone call from President Clinton to Yeltsin on Friday, the Kremlin
announced Saturday that Yeltsin was heading back to his country
house outside Moscow while Sergei Dubinin, chairman of the Central
Bank, and Anatoly Chubais, Russia's crisis troubleshooter, returned
early from their vacations. Kiriyenko met top advisers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the game has clearly been to try to avoid sparking a
panic and causing a run on Russian banks. So far, that has not
happened to any significant degree. But the tide of depositors
seeking withdrawal is quickening, and Saturday in Moscow, several
banks simply shut down their automatic teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Whether because they have become used to crises, or because so
many Russians have little to do with banks, many people seemed more
wary than panicked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not scared,'' said Nikolai Smirnov, 43, a businessman
who was changing money for a vacation abroad. ``Anything can happen
in Russia. The most important thing is there be no blood.''

<P>
   Russians now have an estimated $25 billion worth of ruble
savings deposits. Another $25 billion worth of rubles is thought to
be held at home, in cash, in drawers and under mattresses,
reflecting deep suspicions about the reliability of banks. At least
the same amount, but probably more, is said to be held abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Of the savings held in Russian banks, a whopping 80 percent are
held in Sberbank, the old Soviet savings bank network, which is now
half-owned by the government and fully backed by government
guarantees. By all reports, Sberbank _Russia's largest bank and a
major holder of government securities _ has not been hit by a surge
of withdrawals, although some branches were limiting dollar
withdrawals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But by one estimate, $4 billion of savings are held in those
banks that are now in the biggest trouble _ including most
prominently SBS Agro, a bank with a far-flung network based on the
old Soviet Agroprom bank with outlets across rural Russia, and
Inkombank. They are ranked as Russia's two largest banks after the
colossal Sberbank.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Standard &AMP; Poors lowered its credit rating on six
Russian banks, saying there had been ``a precipitous decline of
market conditions in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the London-based rating agency Fitch IBCA put a Risk
Alert rating on SBS Agro, a sign that the bank is being closely
watched for signs of instability. Like SBS Agro's creditors,
officials at Fitch IBCA had trouble getting hard information from
the bank's Moscow headquarters last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview on Friday night, SBS Agro's chief of
public relations issued vague words of reassurance. ``The Central
Bank of Russia provides assistance to the commercial banks in this
situation,'' he said. ``The form of this assistance is absolutely
obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   After issuing confusing statements on Friday, the Central Bank
also confirmed that it had loaned money to SBS Agro and other
unnamed banks to tide them through. How much credit, and in what
currency, was extended to the troubled banks was unclear, and
according to experts, varied from bank to bank, with unofficial
figures ranging from 100 million rubles to 500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The banks' access to hard currency reserves appears to be still
restricted, which helps explain the fluctuating value of the ruble
on the street, where speculators are already taking advantage of
the increasing demand for dollars. Limits on bank access to such
reserves were announced Wednesday, adding to the plunge in the
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, Russia's banking crisis was a crisis
waiting to happen, as Russian banks _ known for their aggressive
trading _ went farther and farther out on a limb, borrowing money
on the backs of Russia's government securities.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   When the value of those securities plummeted during this
summer's financial crisis, the banks, which had used government
securities as collateral, were asked by creditors to come forward
with the difference _ in dollars _ between the securities' original
value, and their reduced market value. Lacking the funds to do so,
several banks _ SBS Agro among them _ defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   With confidence in the ruble fast evaporating, many banks _ in
some cases, different banks _ found themselves trapped by another
game of their own devising, known as forward contracts. These
contracts were used by big Moscow banks to loan dollars to
creditors, often smaller regional banks, in return for ruble
credits that come due at regular intervals, at previously fixed
rates. One batch of such forward contracts was scheduled to come
due this weekend, at a moment when the banks are short of rubles as
well as dollars and the value of the ruble is slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Moving money around is what banks do, but according to many
analysts, Russian banks were allowed to do it recklessly because of
a lax regulatory system. In recent years, banking authorities have
moved to reduce the number of the banks in Russia, and increase the
minimum capital requirement. From a peak of 2,500 banks in 1994 _
many of which were really small banks for local industries used for
money laundering _ 1,500 remain. Even before the crisis, that
number was expected to be reduced by several hundred by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the concern last week is over Russia's major banks, and
given the interlocking relationship between banks, the fear is of a
chain-reaction of defaults on outstanding loans, which is why by
week's end, interbank trading had virtually stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the financial crisis this summer served as a
warning to the government that it needed drastic action if foreign
investors were to be lured back to Russian markets. Some analysts
expect that the second phase will have the same effect on the
banking sector and the Central Bank, which is now expected to put
tighter controls on commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers were being traders, not bank managers like in the
West,'' said Tom Adshead, director of research at United Financial
Group, a Moscow-based investment firm. ``Now, they are going to
have to change. It is like the government. Until this crisis,
people in Russia kept postponing the difficult decisions. Now
everyone has to wake up and face the music.'' &QL;

FOUNDATION STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR MONUMENT TO MILITARY WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nonprofit foundation that built and maintains
the monument to women who have served in the American military is
struggling to raise enough money to pay off construction costs and
other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   After drawing national praise for the first memorial honoring
military women amid the ever-increasing number of Washington
memorials and monuments, the foundation is unable to pay about $2
million in construction costs to Clark Construction Group Inc., and
$30,000 more for inaugural festivities.
</P>
<P>
   The October 1997 dedication at Arlington National Cemetery,
which drew about 30,000 people, including Vice President Al Gore,
culminated nearly 11 years of fund-raising and planning. President
Ronald Reagan signed legislation in 1986 approving the Women in
Military Service for America Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Construction has thus far been willing to pay its
subcontractors out of pocket because the Women in Military Service
for America Memorial Foundation does not have the money to pay its
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a legal matter right now,'' said Michael Alto, the
project executive with Clark Construction handling the memorial.
``We have a good relationship with the foundation and I understand
that they rely heavily upon donations. Some of their big donors
have just fallen through.''
</P>
<P>
   Alto, who continues to negotiate the bill with the foundation,
noted that monthly payments were made to Clark Construction through
September 1997; further payments, however, did not follow. Alto was
unaware then that the foundation was experiencing difficulties
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   Marilla Cushman, the director of public relations for the
foundation, said that groups seeking money to establish and
maintain monuments and memorials in Washington were forced to
``compete for the same piece of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is competing for private donations with the
foundations that support at least a dozen other monuments in
varying stages of fund-raising or construction, said John Parsons,
associate superintendent of stewardships and partnerships for the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to build memorials are evaluated by the National Park
Service, the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital
Planning Commission. In a study released in November 1997, the
National Capital Planning Commission listed as many as 10 new
museums and 60 new monuments or memorials that will be searching
for sites in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   There are already 154 memorials in the capital area.
</P>
<P>
   The military women's memorial and the U.S. Naval Memorial and
Naval Heritage Center, unlike most of the other monuments in the
Washington area, may be buoyed by their money-making abilities.
Both memorials can generate operating revenue by leasing its
facilities for receptions and conferences and by selling
educational items and memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   The Women in Military Service memorial intends to catalog
servicewomen on a computer register, thus establishing a database
for women who have served in the armed forces. Donations are
requested for each listing. The foundation also prints several
newsletters, which are sent to servicewomen. Appeals for money
appear in the newsletters and in some veteran's publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great constituency that supports the memorial and
its activities,'' Ms. Cushman said. ``We can be an extraordinary
network and outreach resource for servicewomen and women veterans.
We are hopeful.'' &QL;

IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS, LINK EMERGES TO RICH SAUDI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Expands earlier story.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal law-enforcement officials said Saturday
that they had obtained information tentatively linking an associate
of Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi-born businessman who has vowed
to wage a holy war against the United States, to the bombing of the
U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The officials declined to specify the nature of the evidence
connecting Bin Laden to the bombings. But Saturday's issue of
Newsday reported that a witness had identified an associate of Bin
Laden as having been in the truck carrying the bomb that heavily
damaged the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Kenya and killed more
than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper identified the witness as one of the two privately
employed security guards working at the embassy gate at the time of
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Saturday, intelligence and law-enforcement
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was no
certain identification of the suspect, described as a relatively
low-level member of Bin Laden's circle.
</P>
<P>
   But officials indicated that this was the first potential
evidentiary link to Bin Laden, who the FBI and CIA have suspected
from the start was a key figure in the bombing plot.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said since the early hours of the
investigation that the suspect at the top of their list was Bin
Laden, who this year renewed his vow to wage a holy war against the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Senior U.S. officials have said that he has a network in Africa,
and that U.S. intelligence had evidence that he has operatives in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   But officials previously cautioned that there has been no hard
evidence linking Bin Laden or his agents to the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.S. officials point to the nearly simultaneous bombings
at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7 as indicating
that the attack was carried off by sophisticated terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's network is one that has the financial resources and
the organizational skills for such a coordinated attack, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group under suspicion by the United States is the
Islamic Jihad, based in Cairo, Egypt, but that organization is also
financed by Bin Laden, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a wealthy Saudi family that made its money in the
construction business, Bin Laden is thought to have been involved
in the bombings of two U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia.
But the United States has never issued an arrest warrant for Bin
Laden because of lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden lived for a time in Sudan. He is said to live in
Afghanistan now, under the protection of the Taliban, the militant
Islamic group that controls most of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said Bin Laden had become the subject
of an intense internal discussion at the FBI over whether the New
York office should take jurisdiction of the bombing case away from
the Washington field office, which has jurisdiction over crimes
against Americans in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials in New York have argued that they have
investigated Bin Laden in connection with the World Trade Center
bombing, and therefore should take over the Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam bombings in the event that he is found to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, a British newspaper, The Glasgow Herald,
reported that the Pakistani secret service is holding a suspect in
connection with the embassy bombings and is hunting two others. A
U.S. official in Pakistan said that a Pakistani newspaper had also
reported the arrest of a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper report cited unidentified Pakistani intelligence
officials as saying Mohammed Sadiq, 32, was detained at Karachi
international airport when he arrived on a Pakistan International
Airways flight from Kenya on Aug. 7, the day of the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Sadiq was held when he presented a false passport at customs,
the newspaper said. The officials were quoted as saying that
another suspect was in hiding in Pakistan and that a third was in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   All three suspects were said to have been en route to
Afghanistan, having flown out of Kenya before the bombs went off.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three, suspected to be a bomb maker, was believed to
have left Kenya on Aug. 4, three days before the explosions and was
probably now in Afghanistan, The Glasgow Herald reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   President Clinton, in an address videotaped for broadcast
overseas, said that the Kenyans and Tanzanians killed in the
bombings ``were important to America because we cherish our
friendship with your peoples.'' At least 247 Kenyans and 10
Tanzanians died in the explosions. More than 5,000 people were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent extremists try to use bullets and bombs to derail our
united efforts to bring peace to every part of the earth,'' Clinton
said. ``We grieve together, but I am proud that our nations have
also renewed our commitment to stand together.''

U.S. SENDS MARINES TO EMBASSY IN ALBANIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ With the U.S. Embassy in Albania shut down for
fear of a terrorist attack and its dependents and nonessential
personnel sent home, a company of marines flew in Saturday to stand
guard over those remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are told there is a high threat out there,'' said Maj.
Frank Carroll, the commander of the Marine reinforcement, which was
hurriedly diverted from nearby NATO maneuvers to protect the few
U.S. diplomats left in this capital.
</P>
<P>
   The worries apparently stemmed from reports of the arrest in
Albania of another Islamic fundamentalist belonging to the militant
Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization, who if extradited could face
execution by the authorities in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of August, the Jihad group, one of whose
splinter cells assassinated President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, said
that three of its members had been arrested here and turned over to
the Egyptian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Jihad promised retaliation against the United States, which
it blames for the arrests. That threat was made shortly before the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. &QL;

DEADLY CAR BOMBING IN N. IRELAND RAISES FEARS FOR PEACE ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ In one of the deadliest paramilitary attacks
ever in Northern Ireland, a car bomb killed at least 20 people
Saturday and wounded more than 100 in the town of Omagh, 55 miles
west of Belfast, the capital of the British province.
</P>
<P>
   The blast raised fears for the survival of the Northern Ireland
peace agreement between majority Protestants and minority Roman
Catholics, as the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic
watched scenes of spilled blood and destruction on evening
television news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was carnage,'' said Nigel O'Kane, whose pub is a few
hundred yards from the explosion. It happened at about 3 p.m., a
half hour after the bombers made an apparently misleading phone
call to a newspaper warning that a bomb would be detonated.
</P>
<P>
   The caller, giving a code name recognized as one used by the
Irish Republican Army, according to police, said the bomb would go
off near the court house. Police moved crowds of shoppers several
hundred yards away from the court house, but the bomb exploded at
the spot where the shoppers had been moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's ever happened in this town in such a long time,''
O'Kane said, adding, ``There are a lot of people in tears,
panicking, looking for their loved ones. They don't know if they're
dead or injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Local hospitals called for blood donors and volunteer doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Several shops were devastated, and the streets, one-half mile
from the center of town, were covered with rubble as British
soldiers, police, firefighters and paramedics searched for
survivors and more dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is blood everywhere,'' said Ken Maginnis, a member of
the British Parliament and a leader of the mainstream Protestant
Ulster Unionist Party. Although no one initially claimed
responsibility for the blast, he said it was obvious that the
bombers were a Catholic Republican splinter group opposed to the
peace accord that was approved in May in a referendums in the North
and here in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Dublin to crack down on the group, which is
believed to operate out of the Irish Republic, calling itself the
real IRA, and crossing the border into the North for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has been observing a cease-fire for 13 months and the
dissidents feel the peace agreement is a sellout of republican
goals, particularly the establishment of a unified Ireland with the
mostly Protestant north subsumed in the overwhelmingly Catholic
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the blast was ``the most
horrific act in years, a tragic day.'' He said the Irish Republic
would seek ``to crush these people.'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair called the blast ``an appalling attack of savagery and
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Paddy McGann, a local official in Omagh, said the Protestants
and Catholics in the town had lived peaceably together, free of
terrorist attacks for years. He noted that the attacks, attributed
to Catholic dissidents, came on the Assumption of the Blessed
Virgin, an important feast day for Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope whoever did this say their prayers tonight,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of Britain and the Irish Republic, sponsors of
the peace effort, have repeatedly stated that terrorism by
dissident groups would not destroy the peace effort, under which a
new Northern Ireland Assembly convened in June to work out a new
political structure that would give Northern minority Catholics
more power.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's attack could lead to retaliation by Protestant
paramilitaries, which in turn would put pressure on the IRA to end
its cease-fire and return the province to the sectarian warfare
that has killed more than 3,200 people since 1969. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE BABE STOOD TALLEST AMONG HIS YOUNGEST FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (bl) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Even as he faced death, Babe Ruth apparently had
time for a kid. This is part of the legend that seems beyond
dispute, above and beyond the timeless and insoluble debate of
whether he called his shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe Ruth was the eternal kid, and that's why he could never
resist them,'' said a man who has spent the last 16 years
unearthing proof.
</P>
<P>
   It's the stories people come to tell, the mementos they want to
show, or sell, that make Michael Gibbons' job the equivalent of
sticking a hand into a historical grab bag of Ruthian delights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Gibbons knocked on the door of the then-struggling Babe
Ruth Museum to produce a documentary on the most famous American
baseball player. He never left 216 Emory St., the small row house
and birthplace of the Babe, in the shadow of what is now Orioles
Park at Camden Yards. Here, he marks a fine line between man and
myth.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidental fact: exactly 216 major league pitchers surrendered
home runs to the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   Contrived fiction: Little Frankie Haggerty cried over the Babe's
body at the funeral in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper photos sent around the country days after Ruth's
death at age 52 _ 50 years ago Sunday _ did present a 10-year-old
boy standing over Ruth's casket, holding a ball signed by Ruth in
one hand while the other appeared to be wiping away a tear from his
left eye.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, the country was familiar with Frank Haggerty of
Danvers, Mass., who months earlier had taken it upon himself to
write to a cancer-stricken Ruth, in October 1947, offering himself
as a stand-in at the funeral of Brother Gilbert, Ruth's boyhood
mentor at St. Mary's Industrial School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry your friend Brother Gilbert died,'' Haggerty wrote
to Ruth. ``If you wish, and I can get permission from the other
brothers, I will go for you, as I live in Danvers. I will behave.
Love, Frank Haggerty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, who seldom behaved, wrote back from New York in a Western
Union telegram dated Oct. 21, 1947:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Frank: Thank you for your letter and I will be most
grateful to you if you will represent me at Brother Gilbert's
funeral. I am unable to go but I will feel I am there in spirit
through your gracious gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggerty attended the priest's funeral, and a weakened Ruth
continued to answer the boy's letters, inviting him in one
correspondence to send a ball he would sign, and telling him in
another that he was proud of the ``fine pictures in the paper'' of
Haggerty at Brother Gilbert's funeral. ``I think you're a grand
kid,'' Ruth signed off on Oct. 31, from his address at 110
Riverside Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Haggerty saved every photo, every scrap of paper. He
grew up to become a merchant seaman, and moved to Baltimore in
1968. Not long ago, after Haggerty's wife had died and his savings
had shriveled, he went to Gibbons at 216 Emory St. Orioles owner
Peter Angelos was solicited by Gibbons. Angelos agreed to pay
Haggerty $5,000, allowing the museum to secure the material, all
authentic. Except, it turned out, for the photo of the kid crying
for the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photographers knew who I was, and one of them asked me to
brush away a tear, so I did,'' Haggerty told Gibbons. He also
confessed to a reporter for The Baltimore Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The truth of the matter was that the country was crying for
Ruth, and it wasn't as if he had any role in the dramatization of
the photo op. Haggerty's story was, if anything, more proof of what
a grand guy Babe Ruth was, at least when it came to dealing with
kids.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Kevin Williams, a former investment banker who quit
his job to take an anniversary Ruth show on the road for Gibbons
this summer, believes it is generational justice when children pull
their fathers in the direction of a life-size stand-up that is
measured exactly to Ruth's 6 feet 2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in 23 cities, major and minor league ball parks
with the show,'' Williams said. ``I'm amazed when the kids see the
stand-up and they yell out, `It's Babe Ruth.' And the man has been
dead for 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Players who don't approach Ruthian levels of fame today whine
how they can't go out to a restaurant or a movie without attracting
a crowd, as if they aren't let through side doors, into private
rooms. None of this was a problem for Ruth, evidently, in his
prime, or in his decline.
</P>
<P>
   He signed, according to Gibbons, more than 600,000 baseballs
between 1914 and his death, including one on July 13, 1948. As this
story goes, Ruth was making what would be his last trip to
Baltimore, to a sandlot baseball game, where he was scheduled to
present an award to a boy from his former school, St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, when Ruth arrived at the rain-drenched
airport, he was informed the game had been postponed. But by the
steps leading down from the plane, a father waited with his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you sign this for the boy?'' the father asked.
</P>

   The dying Ruth smiled, took the ball in his hand, signed it and
returned to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, the boy _ his name was Sig Seidenman _ brought a
ball to Gibbons, claiming it was the last one Ruth signed in his
hometown. You could still see the smudges made by the raindrops.
</P>
<P>
   When this story made the local paper, it wasn't long before more
proof of the episode was presented to Michael Gibbons by one Paul
Geppi.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was the kid from St. Mary's who had missed out on
meeting the Babe. And he gave Gibbons the plaque that proved it. &QL;

TECHNOLOGY IS SET FOR CLINTON TESTIMONY

   WASHINGTON _ Few details have been officially disclosed about
how President Clinton will testify by closed-circuit television on
Monday or how the broadcast will be protected from the inquiring
eyes and ears of people outside the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of cameras for testimony, common in federal civil
courts for the last five years, is slowly working its way into
criminal cases, and technical experts said the technology was well
established.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman, said that the hookup
between the White House and the courthouse where the grand jury
meets would be set up by the White House Communications Agency,
with a ``one-way live feed.'' That means a camera at one end and a
monitor at the other, with one-way visual and audio communication.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president would be in the Map Room, the same
place Clinton used when he testified in a Whitewater-related case
in 1996. The judge in that case ruled that if the president were to
testify on camera, the screen should not show him in a place that
included familiar trappings of his office.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding will be covered by the normal rules of grand jury
secrecy. &QL;

ASTROS' ACQUISITION OF JOHNSON CHANGES BALANCE OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In only two weeks it has become obvious that the presence of
Randy Johnson will change the dynamics of the National League
playoffs, maybe even the World Series. The significance of
Johnson's role in the Houston Astros' quest to win their first
pennant can be summed up in the reaction of Phil Garner the day
after Johnson shut out his Milwaukee Brewers last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man,'' Garner said, ``this guy's killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   And he might do the same to the Atlanta Braves, the San Diego
Padres and, yes, even the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the major leagues' most dominating pitcher, has again
become a force, this time in a new league and a new division. Too
much cannot be made out of his presence at the head of the Astros'
starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish at negotiating times,'' Garner said, ``that players
realize the No. 1 starter should make most of the money. It's so
obvious when you're the manager that when you have a No. 1 starter,
it slots everyone else and makes it easier for everyone else. When
you don't have a No. 1, the weaknesses show up. The No. 1 guy takes
all the heat. He bears all the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone think that Johnson's performance with the Seattle
Mariners _ a 9-10 record and 4.33 earned run average _ indicated a
pitcher in decline, listen to Garner again in his discussion of the
likelihood that Johnson's uncertain and unhappy status before the
trade affected his pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that's what happened,'' the
Brewers' manager said. ``My reports were he wasn't throwing very
good, was erratic and didn't have good velocity. He wasn't the
Randy Johnson we knew. But last night there was no difference from
what he did in the playoffs a couple years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In those playoffs, in 1995, Johnson personally escorted the
Yankees out of post-season play.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees haven't faced Johnson since that electrifying
division series. They seemed to just miss him in subsequent
regular-season series; he would pitch the day before or the day
after a Yankees series.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently they missed him because he was traded. The Yankees
were in Seattle at the time, and Johnson was scheduled to pitch the
Sunday game. Instead he started that day for the Astros in
Pittsburgh, and it was that game that should have started the
Braves and the Padres thinking of the perils of October.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already made a difference in the Astro club and that will
carry through to the post-season,'' Garner said. ``The Astros are a
better club this year than last. Last year they were a little awed
by the playoff situation and they were outgunned by Atlanta. Don't
count them out now.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner was making no predictions of an Astros' pennant, but he
said, ``They're a different club. They're extremely confident and
play like they expect to win. Moises Alou has made them better.
Johnson is going to make them a lot better. He's going to get a
chance to make them better in two games in the first round of the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Johnson's arrival, the Astros were on their way to
compiling the third best won-lost record among the three division
champions. Actually, conceding them the NL Central championship was
premature; the Chicago Cubs were only three and a half games behind
the Astros and were considered a threat to them.
</P>
<P>
   But since Johnson put his foot on the pitching rubber in
Pittsburgh, the Astros, entering last night's game with the Cubs,
had won 9 of 12 games and raised their lead to 8 games. Johnson won
all three times he started, pitching shutouts in the last two.
</P>
<P>
   The spurt has placed the Astros in position to snatch one of the
home-field advantage spots in the playoffs, a position highly
unlikely only a few weeks ago. Even if they don't get one of those
two spots, they will have Johnson pitching two games in the
division series and maybe three in the league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   His presence means that Shane Reynolds and Mike Hampton don't
have the burden of being the focal point of the playoff pitching
rotation. By the time the Braves, the Padres, the Mets or whoever
sees Nos. 2 and 3, they may be shell-shocked from their encounter
with No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize what kind of factor he brings to the ball
club just in terms of confidence and feeling like you're the bully
on the block,'' Garner said. ``I think there's value in that and I
think he's added value to the club.''
</P>
<P>
   In his three starts, Johnson allowed two runs and 16 hits,
walked four and struck out 33 in 25 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched some kind of awesome against us,'' Garner said.
``He might as well go to the Hall of Fame right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Johnson and the Astros will settle for the World
Series.

NEW YORK SPORTS HISTORY  
 YOSHII BECOMES MOST FRUSTRATED PITCHER  
 DINGERS FOR LOSERS  
 MORE YANKEE FODDER 
</HEADLINE>

   New York Sports History
</P>
<P>
   Although the chances would seem to be remote, it is possible
that Sunday, Oct. 4, could be the most momentous day in recent New
York sports history. Both the Yankees and the Mets could be playing
playoff games in the city that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, of course, have to win the National League wild-card
spot for that doubleheader even to be possible. Then they would
have to take the series to a fourth game because the Sunday game
would be their second home game.
</P>
<P>
   But the team playing the Yankees would have to do even better.
It would have to take the Yankees to a fifth and final game, a feat
that would seem highly unlikely the way the Yankees have breezed
through this season.
</P>
<P>
   Because tickets to the games of both teams would be scarce, few
fans would have the dilemma of deciding which game to attend if
those events did occur. There certainly would be no dilemma for the
city's mayor, Rudy Giuliani. The Mets would be far from his mind as
he sat in his box seat at Yankee Stadium, wearing his Yankees
jacket, of course.
</P>
<P>
   For the mayor's scheduling purposes, the Yankees will play the
first two games at home Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, Sept. 29
and 30, then play in their opponent's park Friday and Saturday. The
Mets' two home games would be Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii Becomes Most Frustrated Pitcher
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday was a good day for Jason Schmidt of Pittsburgh
and Scott Eyre of the Chicago White Sox. Schmidt won for the first
time since June 1, ending a 12-start streak in which he suffered
eight losses that dropped his record to 8-9.
</P>
<P>
   Eyre won for the first time since April 25, ending a run of 10
starts without a victory. The only thing that interrupted the
streak was Eyre's disappearance from the starting rotation for
nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   Their success left Masato Yoshii of the Mets as clearly the most
frustrated starting pitcher in the majors. Yoshii has started 14
times since May 27, the date of his last victory, and has emerged
with five losses and nine no-decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line is Matt Beech of Philadelphia, who hasn't won in
nine starts since June 15. Carlos Perez, whom Montreal traded to
Los Angeles two weeks ago, has won one of his last 13 starts since
June 3. He has lost eight of the starts, and the Dodgers have lost
all three games he has started for them.
</P>
<P>
   Dingers for Losers
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are fun, especially when players hitting them are
chasing the home run record, but what do they mean?
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen players have hit 30 or more this season, and five play
for losing teams. Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez play for the
same losing team.
</P>
<P>
   Last season 28 players hit 30 or more. Only two of the 13
National League players played on teams with losing records, but
eight of the 14 American Leaguers played for losers. Then there was
Mark McGwire, the 28th player, who played in both leagues. Both of
his teams, Oakland and St. Louis, had losing records.
</P>
<P>
   More Yankee Fodder
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' remarkable season has focused attention on just
about every aspect of their organizational lives, but can't a
moratorium be declared on news about the latest feud between Reggie
Jackson and George Steinbrenner?
</P>
<P>
   Reggie knew from the first show that life with George would be
difficult. Furthermore, what else could he expect when he sold his
Hall of Fame identification for a front-office job with the club? &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 35-foot-high Doric column rises proudly _ if oddly
_ among a stand of birch trees on a hilltop in upstate New York. A
delicate maiden known as ``Day'' sits in a concrete recycling plant
in the Bronx. Great chunks of pink granite litter the New Jersey
Meadowlands, hidden by reeds, guarded by snapping turtles.
</P>
<P>
   These are the remains of the old Pennsylvania Station. And 35
years after their dispersal, many of the fragments may be coming
back to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation, a state
agency, hopes to use architectural remnants from the long-lost
building as decorative elements in a new passenger concourse and
ticketing hall it is planning in the General Post Office, directly
across Eighth Avenue from the station.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandros Washburn, the president of the corporation, and his
project associate, Marijke Smit, have tracked fragments as far as
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Their most poignant discovery, however, has not been granite and
marble but flesh and blood: the legion of preservationists _ some
known, many anonymous _ who struggled in the early 1960s, before
the New York City landmarks law was enacted, to save what they
could of McKim, Mead &AMP; White's masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   There was the photographer Peter Moore and his wife, Barbara,
who visited the station repeatedly during demolition to record its
vanishing glory. There was Bayard Rustin, the civil rights leader,
who recovered several balusters for his art collection.
</P>
<P>
   And there was James Ahearn, a newspaper writer, who loaded his
Ford with pieces from the Meadowlands, where the stonework of
Pennsylvania Station had been hauled by the demolition contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People _ not governments or corporations or institutions _
have been keeping the memory of Penn Station alive for 35 years,''
said Washburn, who was only 16 months old when the wreckers went to
work. ``We've found threads from the fabric of Penn Station
stretching across the country. Few buildings can inspire that
continuum. It makes you want to reweave those threads.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Pennsylvania Station concourse is to be built within the
General Post Office, an 84-year-old landmark that was also designed
by McKim, Mead &AMP; White. Formally known as the James A. Farley
Building, it sits directly over the Amtrak train platforms, between
31st and 33rd streets, almost like a western extension of the
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``By incorporating the fragments from the old station into the
new station, we are going to honor the past and hopefully set a
standard for the future,'' said Charles Gargano, the chairman of
Empire State Development Corp., of which the Pennsylvania Station
agency is a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the fragments will fit into the structure is not yet
clear. Architects at Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill and Hardy Holzman
Pfeiffer Associates in Manhattan are working on preliminary designs
for the $315 million project. ``We're not hoping or expecting to
find a complete colonnade,'' Washburn said. ``We're hoping to find
a few choice fragments.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no budget line for archeological treasure. Instead,
state officials are counting on donations. ``We are not set up to
be buying back artifacts,'' Washburn said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, the guardians of Pennsylvania Station's legacy have been
generous.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Moore, the proprietor of the Bound and Unbound bookshop
and gallery in Manhattan, has shared hundreds of haunting
photographs taken by her husband, who died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who was best known for chronicling performance art,
visited the station more than 30 times from 1963 to 1966, often
lugging a large-format camera. Viewed in sequence, his pictures
show a place of lyrical sculptural beauty slowly reduced to stark
structural bones. Meanwhile, commuters are seen in shocking
proximity to the wrecking cranes.
</P>
<P>
   Never before published, Moore's photographs have already
provided Washburn with a useful clue: there is no point searching
for the 60-foot-high Corinthian columns of the main waiting room,
since they were not solid stone but merely decorative casings over
steel.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs were not the only things taken by the Moores. They
also salvaged a half-dozen brass and leather stools from the
Savarin coffee shop. To this day, Ms. Moore is not sure why she and
her husband were carrying enough cash on them to pay the wreckers
$15 each for the stools. But she does know how they were able to
get them home: ``Checker cab.''
</P>
<P>
   Another visitor to the station was Rustin, not long after he
helped lead the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He
dragged home a couple of balusters with the help of friends. His
executor, Walter Naegle, is considering donating them in honor of
Rustin and A. Philip Randolph, who organized the Brotherhood of
Sleeping Car Porters, a powerful voice for black workers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first donations _ two 29-inch granite balusters,
ornamental posts apparently from the attic of the station _ came
from Ahearn, who rescued them from the Meadowlands in 1968 and set
them up in front of his house in Ridgewood, N.J. as flower-pot
pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a field of neo-classical debris, Ahearn posed his
10-year-old son, Michael, atop an Ionic capital for a snapshot.
Then he set to the task of pushing the balusters up wood planks and
into his station wagon until it sagged to the rear axle.
</P>
<P>
   As an editorial writer for The Bergen Record, Ahearn had to
confront his conscience since he was, to be blunt, stealing. But He
consoled himself with the knowledge that the pieces would otherwise
be pounded into the foundation of a parking lot, although his
anxiety sharpened when a patrol car passed by with its roof light
flashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got home with our booty and exulted at rescuing objects of
beauty, fragments of history,'' Ahearn wrote to Washburn. ``They
have been waiting ever since for the undertaking on which you are
now embarked.''
</P>
<P>
   The least portable fragment found to date was a 35-foot Doric
column that was hauled to Woodridge, N.Y., in Sullivan County,
around 1963 and re-erected by cranes.
</P>
<P>
   It was intended as a beacon to spur development of Verrazano
College, a four-year, liberal-arts school that was being promoted
by a lawyer, Gilbert DiLucia, and others. But nothing more came of
the college than the column.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Schwartz, a financial analyst in Manhattan, remembered
being taken as a child to see the column by his father, Martin. He
left a message in March with the Pennsylvania Station agency, not
sure whether anyone in the office would care. Within 30 minutes,
Ms. Smit called him back and scheduled a field trip for the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the obvious logistical challenge of moving the column,
Washburn said its return would be ``problematic,'' since the owner
wants to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Washburn and Ms. Smit have focused their efforts on a
trucking company lot on Secaucus Road in the Meadowlands. One
expedition earlier this summer began at the Hackensack Meadowlands
Development Commission in Lyndhurst, where they asked to see
topographical maps and aerial photographs of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in search of Penn Station,'' Washburn explained to
Dennis Warren, a draftsman at the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you're going to put that dinosaur back together again,''
Warren said, as he pulled out large sheets showing the intersection
of 74 degrees 3 minutes longitude, 40 degrees 46 minutes latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the site, Washburn and Ms. Smit donned hip waders
and weaved their way among 53-foot-long truck trailers and swamp
grasses 8 feet high. Suddenly came an exultant shout from Washburn:
``It looks like a piece of exterior cornice!''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, under a small grove of box elders, partly submerged
in the mud at a crazy angle, there was a seven-foot-long chunk of
Pennsylvania Station's famously pink granite. The piece was shaped
like a fat comma, one side smooth as a table top, the other side
deeply pockmarked.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Washburn has had the lot examined by a
ground-penetrating radar device. His dearest wish is to find what
he calls the ``Holy Grail'' of Pennsylvania Station relics: a
missing pair of allegorical maidens by Adolph Weinman known as
``Day'' (her faced upraised and framed by sunflowers) and ``Night''
(her face hooded, clutching poppies).
</P>
<P>
   There were four ``Day'' and four ``Night'' figures on the
station, which opened in 1910, along with 14 large stone eagles.
Two eagles stayed at the station and can still be seen near the
Seventh Avenue entrance. The rest found homes from Maine to
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   One ``Day'' and ``Night'' pair were taken to Kansas City as the
centerpiece of the Eagle Scout Tribute Fountain. Another pair were
rescued from the Meadowlands and carted to Ringwood State Park in
northern New Jersey. A lone ``Night'' figure was saved by the
Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Five months ago, Con-Agg Recycling Corp. at East 149th Street
and Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx let Washburn know that another
``Day'' had been sitting in its yard for years, damaged but not
lost. That leaves one ``Day'' and one ``Night'' unaccounted for.
Washburn is concentrating on the Meadowlands because that is where
most of the stonework was hauled by the Lipsett demolition company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody seriously considered it art,'' Morris Lipsett, the
head of the company, said in 1964, ``they would have put up some
money to save it.''
</P>
<P>
   But somebody did consider it art. In 1965, Parks Commissioner
Newbold Morris wrote to Irving Felt, the chairman and president of
Madison Square Garden Corp., which had bought the air rights to the
station from the Pennsylvania Railroad and was building a new
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Morris told Felt that the Brooklyn Museum hoped to obtain a
figure of ``Night'' as a ``focal point'' for its sculpture garden,
but that the piece had already been consigned to the New Jersey
dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady in question weighs 10 tons,'' Morris wrote. ``Time is
important because the demolition yard is continually being
bulldozed to make room for more Pennsylvania Station ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   With the assistance of Ivan Karp, founder of the Anonymous Arts
Recovery Society and the O.K. Harris Gallery in SoHo, the figure of
``Night'' and part of a monumental Ionic column were soon shipped
to Brooklyn. In 1966, the museum also obtained decorative granite
plaques from the station.
</P>
<P>
   True to Morris' word, they remain the focal points of the Frieda
Schiff Warburg Memorial Sculpture Garden. They are a reminder of
what New York lost and _ indirectly _ what it gained, since the
destruction spurred the landmarks law that helped preserve Grand
Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a turning point in the way New Yorkers felt responsible
for what was going on in their city,'' said Barbara Head Millstein,
the curator of the sculpture garden. ``The Grand Central revival is
a direct result in every possible way of the demolition of Penn
Station.''

FASSEL GETS UNWELCOME FLASHBACK FROM JAGUARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ For the third time in three meetings, the
Jacksonville Jaguars brought out the worst in the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   As they did in the preseason a year ago and in the 1997 regular
season, the Jaguars made the Giants look confused and unprepared in
a lopsided 24-10 defeat Friday night at Alltel Stadium. In three
games during the last two seasons, Jacksonville has outscored the
Giants by 104-39.
</P>
<P>
   On offense Friday, the Giants stumbled badly, picking up just
six first downs and failing to convert a first down on 12 of 13
third-down attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The starting quarterback, Danny Kanell, failed to complete his
first seven passes during a sloppy, penalty-filled first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' vaunted defense fared no better. The tackling was
careless and shoddy, and the defense was called for six first-half
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Giants were thoroughly dominated and looked flat,
something that has happened recently whenever the opponent is
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was flashback for me from our game with them last year,''
Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ``It's like we've reverted to last
year at this time. I'm not very happy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who eased to a 24-17 victory over the Cincinnati
Bengals last weekend, can now expect a week of harsh practices from
Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   The coach raged at his team when it played with similar
indifference last preseason against Jacksonville. He did not look
favorably Friday night on an offense that was out of sync and a
defense that put forth an inattentive effort.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell played the first half, finishing the game with 2
completions in 9 attempts for 47 yards. The Giants' rushing attack
was nearly as ineffective. Tiki Barber dropped another wide-open
pass _ as he did last week _ and ran 3 times for 11 yards. His
replacement, Tyrone Wheatley, came up with only 21 yards on 8
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Of Kanell's performance, Fassel pointed out that his quarterback
was given little time to throw because of poor protection from the
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the quarterback takes five steps into the pocket and
there's five guys on him, there's not much he can do,'' Fassel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel also criticized Barber. ``I'm worried about Tiki right
now,'' he said. ``He's not showing me he can catch the ball in
games or in practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants kept the game close in the second half when both
teams played their second- and third-string units. A bizarre
touchdown scored by Giants receiver Amani Toomer cut the
Jacksonville lead to 17-10 with six seconds remaining in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Toomer dived to the grass to make a shoestring catch on the
Giants' 37-yard line. As defensive back Kevin Devine passed Toomer,
he appeared to reach out to touch him down.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials ruled that no contact was made, no whistle
blew, and Toomer leaped to his feet and dashed into the end zone
untouched for a 73-yard score.
</P>
<P>
   But a touchdown pass from Jacksonville's third-string
quarterback Jonathan Quinn to Alvis Whitted restored the Jaguars'
two-touchdown lead.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the second half, Jacksonville scored on a 59-yard
touchdown run by Tavian Banks, a reserve running back.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, quarterback Mark Brunell led the Jaguars on
an 8-play, 73-yard drive culminating with a 5-yard touchdown pass
to Jimmy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In the early going Friday, the Giants looked sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   There were penalties on both sides of the ball, two low snaps on
Giants punts and more missed Giants tackles in the first quarter
than one would normally have been seen in two Giants games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the ease Kanell showed at the helm in last week's
game seemed a distant memory against the aggressive Jacksonville
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell missed Chris Calloway with his first pass of the evening,
badly overthrowing his receiver. Kanell would follow that up with
six successive incomplete passes.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did not mount a scoring drive _ and Kanell did not
complete a pass _ until midway through the second quarter when
Jacksonville had removed most of its starting defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants moved into Jacksonville territory following a 31-yard
pass down the right sideline from Kanell to Ike Hilliard. It was
Kanell's first completion. But Kanell hit tight end Andy Haase for
a 16-yard gain on the next play, bringing the Giants to the
Jacksonville 18-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' drive stalled there, with kicker Brad Daluiso
converting on a 35-yard field goal, his first of the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn returned a deflected pass 30
yards for an apparent touchdown in the second quarter, a score that
was nullified when the Giants' Phillippi Sparks was called for
holding Jacksonville wide receiver Reggie Barlow.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a variety of penalties called against the Giants'
defense on pass plays in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Percy Ellsworth and Jessie Armstead also drew penalties, and
Sparks had an unnecessary roughness penalty at the end of a play.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars' first-half lead was just 10-3, in part because
Jacksonville place-kicker Mike Hollis missed two first-half field
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Just before intermission, Hollis was successful on a field-goal
attempt from 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled 8 p.m. start of the game was delayed for an hour
because of thunderstorms and lightning in the Jacksonville area.
But an hour later, it had become another clear, humid Florida
night. The game was played in otherwise dry conditions.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' RYAN PHILLIPS, in his new position as a strongside
linebacker, had a sack of Jacksonville's backup quarterback, STEVE
MATTHEWS. Giants defensive end CEDRIC JONES also sacked Matthews in
the second quarter. It was Jones' first sack _ in the preseason or
regular season _ in his three seasons with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Giants defensive end MICHAEL STRAHAN left the game briefly in
the first quarter with what the team called a neck burner, an
injury that is sometimes also called a pinched nerve. Strahan
returned to the game several plays later.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS HUDSON, the Jaguars safety who delivered the hit that
injured IKE HILLIARD's neck in last year's game on Sept. 7 in
Jacksonville, was not active for Friday night's game because of an
injury to his right thumb. &QL;

YANKEE FANS AGREE: SEASON IS A WASTE WITHOUT A TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like those formless creatures who lurk under our beds
in the night, dreadful thoughts now writhe in the minds of sentient
Yankee fans. What if something goes wrong? What if they don't win
it all? Fans talk about the nagging fears that not only might the
season end badly, like life itself, but also that post-season
defeat would negate this glorious regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The chill fingers of an unfriendly Fall have reached into the
dank dog days in Stuart, Fla., where Jane Heller is ``praying with
clammy hands.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been there before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a Ranger fan,'' Heller said last week. ``I remember the
best season ever, 50 wins, Messier, and then the Penguins waddled
in and it was over. And it was as if it had never happened at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the shank of this best season ever, when he should be feeling
only sweet pleasure, Roger Sims in Everett, Wash., has bad dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to eliminate the wild card,'' he said, ``and things go
wrong and we get eliminated. The whole season becomes a hideous
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Was love in vain? Was hope a fraud? Does there always have to be
a payoff?
</P>
<P>
   Why can't we just enjoy one sunset at a time?
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be enough, just the pleasure of the season,'' said
Sims, a former Air Force combat pilot and television producer.
``But it's not. It seems as though we should be able to file away
this season like a precious bijou, no matter how it turns out. But
I can't. That flawed idea of having to win everything is like a
cancer in my brain.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Heller, who writes comic mysteries, to make a joke, to
tell me Sims was wrong. No matter how it ends, won't this be a
summer of dreams?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she snapped. ``It would be a nightmare. You know how I
feel about happy endings; the couples in my books always go off in
the sunset. This is not just about being No. 1. It's about having
this all matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bouton, the newest of Yankee old-timer, sighs at all this.
In his motivational speeches, he has always promoted process over
payoff, of deriving pleasure from chopping the wood rather than
imagining the fire. Since appearing at Old-Timers' Day at the
Stadium last month after a quarter century of exile for writing
``Ball Four,'' his Yankee interest has risen but his philosophy has
not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owners, sportswriters and fans think about winning as the only
payoff,'' he said from his home in the Berkshire Mountains of
western Massachusetts. ``But athletes have to think about playing
their best, playing boldly and courageously. Once they start
thinking about winning, about the end, they start playing to sit on
a lead, to avoid a mistake, to not lose, and that's when you
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that pressure from owners, fans and sportswriters,
particularly the ``hopeless win junkies'' who ``derived their
satisfaction from the trophy instead of the challenge,'' could
distract the players.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sims nor Heller would accept such potential guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's you scribes who will proclaim it's not enough,'' said
Sims, whose only regret in living near Seattle is watching fewer
Yankee games. ``You people will say that they'll have to sweep 11
in a row in the post-season to fulfill their destiny. But if they
don't win it all, what will I say to these latte-lapping jerks
around here?''
</P>
<P>
   Sims stays up late to dial up the results of Yankee games.
Heller wakes up early. And then calls fellow fans around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in everyone's mind,'' she said. ``It's too perfect. You
lose a middle reliever and someone floats in on a raft.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouton thinks there could be a lesson in defeat. ``If they do
lose,'' he said, ``it might afford an opportunity for people to
talk about the values of doing a good job over a long period, which
is a real achievement, versus being hot for a short period, which
is winning mostly with luck and serendipity.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller agrees with Bouton's value system more than the playoff
system. ``The work ethic should mean something,'' she said. ``The
hardest worker over the longest period should win the prize. This
could all be wiped out. I mean, OK, if the Braves beat us in a
great Series, but what if, say, Boston slipped in? Not this season.
Even old wounds are mended. Even Bouton's finally back.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bouton remembers the best advice he ever got, just before
his first World Series start. He was nervous until his fellow
Yankee pitcher Ralph Terry told him that there were 500,000 Chinese
Communists who didn't care about this game at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no one will accept winning the pennant as enough,'' Bouton
said. ``If they win the World Series, the next day, people will
say, `Can they repeat?' The Yankees will never have a night's
sleep. They will be expected to start lifting weights for next
season during the victory parade.''

 BIDDER No. 7 THICKENS THE PLOT IN BROWNS' OWNERSHIP SAGA  
(bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The process of finding an owner for the new Cleveland Browns
team has at times resembled a mystery novel. The National Football
League will not publicly identify any prospective owners, though
six ownership groups have been identified in news media reports.
And there have always been rumors of a seventh.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rumor no more. As of late last week, seven groups had
officially turned in their applications and paid the fees to reach
the final step in the bidding process: a formal presentation to the
NFL owners next week.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery group? According to several team executives, it is
led by Jeremy Jacobs, owner of the National Hockey League's Boston
Bruins and the Fleet Center. Jacobs is also chief executive of
Delaware North Cos.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Jacobs has pursued a professional
football team. He wanted to buy the New England Patriots in the
early 1990s, but they were eventually bought by Robert Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, the NFL executives said, has a solid shot at getting the
Browns. His net worth is estimated at some $600 million. NFL owners
are familiar with him, and they like that he knows how to run a
professional sports franchise. They describe Jacobs as an intensely
private man with a thirst for sports. Jacobs did not return phone
calls and has done few news media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   NFL team executives say Jacobs seems to be willing to spend what
it takes to get the Browns. Estimates are that rights to the team
could sell for anywhere from $400 million to $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   The other groups in the running for the Browns are led by
Richard Jacobs, who owns the Cleveland Indians and is no relation
to Jeremy Jacobs; Tom Murdough; Bert Wolstein; Larry and Charles
Dolan; New York real estate developer Howard Millstein, and Al
Lerner, who has teamed with Carmen Policy, the former general
manager of the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been thought that the Lerner-Policy team is among the
front-runners, but commissioner Paul Tagliabue said recently that
the race is wide open.
</P>
<P>
   All the candidates trying to buy the Browns are businessmen who
own large companies. Jeremy Jacobs is no different, except that his
company may have the most interesting background.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' company, which, among other things, is the
concessionaire to several professional baseball teams, has more
than 200 operating units in dozens of states and some half-dozen
other countries. The company's yearly revenues top $1 billion. The
company was built by his father, Louis Jacobs, who died of a heart
attack while at his desk in 1968 when Jeremy was 28 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time of Louis Jacobs' death, investigators had been
looking into the company, then named Emprise Corporation, for links
to organized crime. Jeremy Jacobs, who took control of Emprise
after his father died, strongly denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, a jury in a Los Angeles federal court ruled
that Emprise conspired to conceal its ownership interests as well
as the interests of two alleged organized crime figures in a Las
Vegas casino. The jury said that Emprise gave hundreds of thousands
of dollars in loans to front men for alleged mobsters at the
casino. The late Louis Jacobs and another son, Max, were named as
unindicted co-conspirators. Emprise was fined $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Sports Illustrated put Louis Jacobs on its cover as
``The Godfather of Sports.''
</P>
<P>
   One year later, the House Select Committee on Crime found that
``Emprise knew or should have known'' that it was either the
financier or business partner for operations with alleged organized
crime connections in states from New England to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no evidence of wrongdoing by the company since
the conviction in 1972. Since then, Jeremy Jacobs has tried to
clean up the company's image. One of his first moves was to change
the name from Emprise, which means a venture involving prowess or
daring, to Delaware North Companies, which refers to the
intersection of Delaware and North streets in Buffalo, where the
company is situated.
</P>
<P>
   Also, according to The Wall Street Journal, Jacobs hired a
former FBI official who was once the head of the bureau's organized
crime unit in New York to check for connections with questionable
characters. As a result, the newspaper reported, the company
stopped dealing with some companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Delaware North's current squeaky-clean status in the
business world and the passage of almost 30 years, the company
still suffers because of that conviction. Competitors have been
said to send old news clippings to potential customers. The
president of Delaware North, Richard Stephens, told The Wall Street
Journal in 1994 that the mob stigma is ``a ghost that won't go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Will that stigma affect Jacobs' bid for the Browns? Not
according to team executives, one of whom called Jacobs ``a class
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy Jacobs is an honorable person and his company is a
great company,'' said one team executive who has done extensive
research on all of the candidates. ``He would be a great owner. I
know him personally and truly like him. He had nothing to do with
what happened in the 1970s.''

 Ditka Breaks a Promise  
 Buccaneers Practice Humility  
(bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ditka Breaks a Promise
</P>
<P>
   When New Orleans coach Mike Ditka made a vow last season to be a
calmer, gentler coach, few people in the NFL believed him. When he
went into orbit last week, getting into an expletive-filled
argument with linebacker Andre Royal, few people were surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka cannot help himself. When Royal, who reported to camp
late, told Saints officials he had injured his right calf muscle,
Ditka did not buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earn the money we're paying you,'' Ditka screamed at Royal.
``You don't fool anybody, least of all me.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal shouted obscenities back and said he has never faked an
injury. The next day, Royal was fined an undisclosed amount by
Ditka.
</P>
<P>
   Buccaneers Practice Humility
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers might be the hot team in league and
news media circles when it comes to picking Super Bowl favorites,
but coach Tony Dungy is not going to let his players believe the
hype.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy called a team meeting and told his players not to get
cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the only concern the team should have is with quarterback
Trent Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer has looked average at best during the preseason, and if
the Buccaneers are indeed going to get to the Super Bowl, he has to
play well. &QL;

TAWANA BRAWLEY STANDS BY HER STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIRTA OJITO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ending the silence that kept her away from the
courtroom during the recent trial of her former advisers, Tawana
Brawley said at a ceremony in Brooklyn Friday night that her fight
for justice is just beginning and insisted that 10 years ago she
was the victim of a vicious crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crime was committed to me,'' she said. ``A crime was
committed to the people. The press has lied to you. They have lied
on me. You should be upset cause I'm very upset. And I'm tired of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brawley, 25, spoke during a banquet in Fort Greene,
Brooklyn, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the United African
Movement, an organization that was created as a protest group
supporting her cause.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks, which were broadcast by New York 1, the cable news
channel, came less than a month after a jury in Dutchess County
ordered three of Ms. Brawley's advisers _ the Rev. Al Sharpton, C.
Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. _ to pay $345,000 to Steven
Pagones, a former prosecutor whom they had accused of being part of
a group of white men who they said kidnapped and raped Ms. Brawley
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brawley, whose story of being attacked when she was a
teen-ager was discredited by a special grand jury in 1988, said her
quest for justice is not over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long way to go 'cause we're not going to stop
fighting,'' she said. ``We're not going to stop fighting for
justice until we get it.''
</P>
<P>
   She praised two of her advisers, Sharpton and Maddox, for
standing by her. ``I say it means so much when you've gone 10 years
in allowing the mass public and people all in your face saying,
`You lied, you lied,''' she said. ``And I said, `How could you say
I lied when I never said anything to you?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned so much about trust, about love, about
commitment, what a real strong black man is. I see that every day
in my father who stood by us every day, by Alton Maddox, by Rev. Al
Sharpton, by all these strong brothers you see on the side of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time Ms. Brawley had spoken publicly about her
case. Last December, she told a roaring audience of supporters in
Brooklyn that she has always told the truth about the attack. &QL;

JOEL BARR, 82, DEFECTOR LINKED TO THE ROSENBERGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Joel Barr, an electronics engineer linked to Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg who defected to the Soviet bloc in 1950 and
became a leading force in the Kremlin's computer industry, died in
a Moscow hospital on Aug. 1. He was 82 and had lived in St.
Petersburg for many years.
</P>
<P>
   He died of heart failure, said Morton Sobell, who spent 18{
years in prison for conspiracy to commit espionage as part of the
Rosenberg case and who had kept in touch with Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Barr was suspected of passing secret information about
technology advances to the Soviets. Fearing arrest by the FBI, he
defected to Czechoslovakia in 1950 and later settled in the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Barr and another American electronics engineer who defected,
Alfred Sarant, were later instrumental in the development of ``the
whole microelectronics and computer industry in the Soviet Union,''
according to Ronald Radosh, co-author with Joyce Milton of ``The
Rosenberg File'' (Yale University Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Rosenbergs, who were tried with Sobell and executed
in 1953 for providing nuclear secrets to the Soviets, Barr was
never arrested or indicted for any espionage role.
</P>
<P>
   But Radosh said that recently released U.S. intelligence reports
provide ``conclusive proof that Barr was part of the spy ring that
Julius Rosenberg put together'' and that the two of them gave the
Soviets ``17 drawings related to high-resolution airborne radar
systems developed at MIT and built by Bell Labs.''
</P>
<P>
   Radosh said the papers even provided Barr's and Sarant's wartime
secret Soviet code names, Metr and Kh'YuS, although it was unclear
which was which.
</P>
<P>
   John Haynes, the co-author with Harvey Klehr of a Soviet history
to be published by Yale, said that the intelligence reports show
that Barr and Sarant ``were among the KGB's most valuable technical
spies.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr was born in New York to parents who had emigrated from
Russia. During the Depression, he studied engineering at the City
College of New York. There he met Julius Rosenberg and Sobell,
fellow students and fellow members of the Young Communist League.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Barr worked in the laboratories of the Army
Signal Corps and later for technology companies, including Western
Electric and Sperry Gyroscope. Those jobs gave him an opportunity
to copy secret documents about technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Wierzbowski, a television producer and close friend of
Barr, said those secrets were passed on to Julius Rosenberg, who
gave them to his Soviet contact, Col. Alexander Feklisov, head of
the industrial espionage arm of the KGB in New York from 1941 to
1945.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1948, Sperry dismissed Barr after discovering that he was
a communist.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, fearing arrest for his activities, left for an extended
stay in Europe. When the Rosenbergs were arrested in 1950, Barr
slipped away from his apartment in a suburb of Paris. He settled in
Czechoslovakia, where he took the name Josef V. Berg of South
Africa, and married a Czech woman, Vera Bergova.
</P>
<P>
   Barr told The Los Angeles Times in 1992 that he kept his true
identity secret from his wife for 20 years. The couple later
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Barr had been joined in Czechoslovakia by Sarant, his old
roommate in New York's Greenwich Village and a fellow member of the
communist cell with the Rosenbergs. Sarant had also disappeared
after the arrest of the Rosenbergs and questioning by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Wierzbowski said the two engineers eventually persuaded Nikita
Khrushchev, then the Soviet leader, that the Soviet Union was way
behind the United States in computer technology, and were invited
to set up their own institute in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The two defectors worked together, earning a reputation as a
highly effective engineering team. Wierzbowski said they
established the large Zelenograd microelectronics center, 30 miles
outside Moscow, and worked there on high-level projects until
Khrushchev fell from power in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Barr and Sarant later started the Leningrad Design Bureau.
Sarant, who took the name Filipp G. Staros, died in 1979, eulogized
in the Soviet government newspaper as an indefatigable contributor
to Soviet microelectronics. Barr's last job was at Svetlana
Electronic Device Manufacturing Co., a huge electronics enterprise
outside St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, Barr said that he
helped the Soviets build their first radar-guided anti-aircraft
artillery. He said that his actions were never meant to ``put the
United States in peril,'' but rather to help communism thrive so
that it might spread to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Barr remained a staunch communist even when Stalin's crimes were
revealed. But toward the end of his life, especially after Mikhail
Gorbachev disclosed the shortcomings of previous communist rulers,
Barr said he gave up on communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that now history will show that the Russian
Revolution was a tremendous mistake,'' Barr told Elizabeth Shogren
of The Los Angeles Times. ``It was a step backward. The real
revolution for mankind that will go down for many, many years was
the American Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what I do now, it was a tremendous mistake to have
done what I did,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   Barr is survived by his Russian companion, known only as Elvira;
four children from his marriage to Ms. Bergova, Vivian Berg and
Robert Berg, both of whom defected to the United States and now
live in San Diego, and Alena Berg and Anton Berg, who live in
Russia; two daughters, Lera and Julia, from his relationship with
Elvira, who live in Russia; two brothers, Arthur of New York and
Bernard of San Diego; a sister, Iris Gilboard of Brighton, Mass.,
and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Although he continued to live in Russia, Barr began to travel to
the United States in the early 1990s to visit his children and to
try to interest U.S. investors in a microelectronics venture. He
even applied for _ and received _ Social Security benefits, to the
chagrin of U.S. officials. He had American and Russian citizenship
and even held a New York driver's license.

MONTGOMERIE TRIES TO MOVE FROM SECOND FIDDLE TO FIRST CHAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Scotland)  (bl) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Colin Montgomerie has been in this position
before, and it has never worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Major championships have ended cruelly for Montgomerie whenever
he has been in contention. He finished second at the 1994 U.S.
Open, losing in a playoff to Ernie Els. Montgomerie finished second
at the 1995 PGA Championship, losing in a playoff to Steve
Elkington. And last year at the U.S. Open, Montgomerie got a
refresher course in heartbreak, finishing second again to Els.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those bitter defeats, one can only imagine the
thoughts twisting through Montgomerie's mind when he teed off
Saturday afternoon for the third round of the PGA Championship.
Still in quest of his first major championship, Montgomerie began
Saturday at Sahalee Country Club in prime position at three under
par, one stroke behind the leader, Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend will provide the latest chapter in Montgomerie's
pursuit of a major. With players like Singh, Tiger Woods, Davis
Love 3d, and Mark O'Meara among those in contention, the weekend is
certain to be memorable, regardless of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But for Montgomerie, this weekend will be feast or famine.
</P>
<P>
   Either he will win his first major, ending his career-long wait
for a career-long goal, or he will fall short again, and be dealt
another crushing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come very close a number of times, more than most,'' said
Montgomerie, a native of Scotland, who has been the leading
money-winner on the European tour for the past five years.
``There's a reason why I've come over here, and I haven't come over
here to finish second.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts Montgomerie's desire to win, and he has constantly
searched for any edge. Dissatisfied with his putting the last two
years, Montgomerie prepared for the PGA by working with Dave Pelz,
the renowned putting teacher. The payoff has been immediate.
Friday, Montgomerie made birdie putts of 10 feet, 15 feet, 20 feet
and 25 feet. If Montgomerie's putter stays solid, he will remain on
the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out here and worked a day and a half early with David,
who I really admire and respect,'' said Montgomerie, referring to
his sessions with Pelz. ``I hadn't met him before, and I had to do
something about my putting. He has been super, oozes confidence,
and that can only make you more confident. Ninety percent of it is
confidence. If you know you're going to hole it, 90 percent of the
time you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie, who is superbly accurate with his drives and long
irons, decided to address his putting woes after the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 37 and 33 putts the first two days,'' said Montgomerie.
``That was about 10 shots too many, 10 putts too many to compete. I
was 10 shots off the lead. So I felt that was the time to call on
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Montgomerie has looked steady so far, it will be
interesting to see how he reacts as the pressure builds this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie plays with his emotions on his sleeve, and when he
hits a bad shot, you can tell by looking at his face.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie has become a favorite target for course hecklers,
but this week, he has heard few negative comments from the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowds here have been super, and I've enjoyed myself as I
always do in America,'' Montgomerie said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Montgomerie's resume will have a glaring hole until he wins
a major. Ten years ago, Montgomerie probably thought he would win
multiple majors, and he still might. But unless he wins the PGA on
Sunday, Montgomerie will have to wait until next year's Masters
before getting another chance. If Montgomerie does win here, it
will be interesting to see how he reacts. Will he shed tears, the
way he did last year after losing to Els the U.S. Open by one
stroke? Will he say, `I told you so' to his critics?' Or will he
simply savor the moment?
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the last 10 PGA champions have been first-time major
winners, so that could be a positive omen for him. In addition,
this seems to be a year for veteran players to win majors. O'Meara,
who won the Masters and the British Open this year at age 41, is
trying to become the first man since Ben Hogan to win three majors
in the same year. And Lee Janzen, who won his second U.S. Open in
June, is only two years younger than Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   But Sahalee's tight fairways and smooth, manicured greens seem
to suit Montgomerie's game. Could this finally be his breakthrough
year at a major? Montgomerie was eager to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great plus in hitting the fairways in America, and I
tend to do that more than most,'' he said. ``I think I got the most
out of my first two rounds that I could. If I can putt anything
like I have the first two days, I have a chance.'' &QL;

BALLOON ON BOAT HAS SAILOR FEELING MORE SECURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., France)  (bl) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, R.I. _ Isabelle Autissier is thinking like a
balloonist these days. But Autissier, a solo sailor from France,
has no intention of going airborne. The balloon she is talking
about fits in the back of her boat, and she has plans to inflate it
only to stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a calculation, but I'm sure it will work,'' the
41-year-old Autissier said of the balloon, which is 283 cubic feet
when inflated. She hopes it will remain folded up innocuously in
the stern of PRB, her 60-foot monohull race boat.
</P>
<P>
   The balloon may seem like a wacky idea. But for a yachtswoman
like Autissier, who has competed in three round-the-world sailboat
races, any kind of life-saving device has merit. Autissier was
rescued by helicopter after her boat lost its mast, was rolled over
and smashed by waves off Australia in the 1994-95 BOC
round-the-world race.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Autissier is preparing for the Around Alone, nee the BOC
Challenge, the solo sailing competition with a fresh set of
sponsors. Both Autissier and Jean-Pierre Mouligne, a yachtsman from
Newport, R.I., are getting ready here at Little Harbor Marina. The
competition, which will have three stops along the way, is
scheduled to begin Sept. 26 from Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Autissier's stopgap balloon will remain no more than an
intriguing possibility unless she needs to inflate it. ``If you
think about it,'' she said recently, ``it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   That would only be likely if PRB turns over in a storm.
Autissier would then release a canister of compressed air into the
balloon. The inflated ball is designed to lift the back of her boat
up high and force the bow into the water. That should give the
yacht enough torque to allow its ballasted keel bulb to swing the
sailboat right-side-up again.
</P>
<P>
   Mouligne also subscribes to the idea, which was developed by
Groupe Finot of France, the designer of his and Autissier's boats.
</P>
<P>
   Single-handed sailors need all the quirky, resourceful equipment
they can muster. They are often forced to rely on themselves, or a
handful of others, to get out of trouble at sea. When they need to
be rescued, critics often complain about the governmental costs
involved. But long-distance sailors are frequently out of range of
help anyway. Autissier was 1,000 miles off shore when the
Australian navy and helicopters came to her aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Frenchwoman, far from being scared off, has proved to be as
strong and persistent as any solo sailor out there. ``These boats
are wonderful,'' she said. ``And even if it is sometimes
frightening and difficult, it is wonderful to be in nature, and to
be at the end of the world with all its wildlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Her outlook draws on uneven results. She was seventh in her
first BOC race in 1990-91 and counts her 1994-95 as only half a
race. Still, those who followed her thwarted efforts that season
know that she was five days ahead of her 19 male rivals in the
first leg from Charleston to Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   She has also competed in the Vendee Globe Challenge, a nonstop
solo race around the world. In the 1996-97 Vendee, she broke her
boat's rudder near Cape Town and was forced to go ashore for
repairs. The landfall disqualified her from the race. Undaunted,
she finished in an unofficial second place anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It is around Cape Horn, an ominous reach of land and ocean at
the tip of South America, that Autissier has made her mark. It has
become so special that her boyfriend in France makes a habit of
chartering a boat out of Ushuaia, Argentina, the nearest port town
near Cape Horn, and waves to her as she passes.
</P>
<P>
   On April 23, 1994, Autissier sailed into San Francisco after
having rounded Cape Horn in a 62-day passage from New York. The
voyage stripped the old record, set in 1989, by an astounding 14
days. An attempt at setting another New York-San Francisco record
left Autissier in second place last spring. Yves Parlier of France
shaved five more days off the 1989 record.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with Autissier's ocean racing log, a series of
highs and lows as undulating as the sea itself. ``One year on the
water is like 10 years of your life,'' she said. ``It is very, very
demanding and stressful. But I'm not doing it for money or to be
well-known. It is something inside of me, and I really want to do
it. If I ever lose that, I will do something else.'' &QL;

CELL PHONES ARE PART OF THE BACKDROP FOR THE NEW WOODSTOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, N.Y. _ The rolling fields of Max Yasgur's farm are again
swathed in a psychedelic quilt of tie-dye-clad music fans. This
time, though, the fans are carrying cellular telephones, and the
automatic teller machines are just a few steps away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think high-tech is kind of infringing on the hippies,'' said
Kevin Carter, who was working at a one-hour photo development stand
in one of the many vendor tents on the site of the original
Woodstock concert. ``Some of the die-hard Woodies are having
problems with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 29 years ago this weekend that hundreds of thousands of
flower children flocked here for a three-day festival of free love
and music.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, they drove, walked or danced right into the fields,
guided only by the spirit of the moment and the age. On Saturday, a
fluorescent highway sign beckoned concertgoers off the proper exit
of Route 17, onto a road lined with orange cones. Traffic was
carefully controlled by the New York State Police.
</P>
<P>
   The edge of the concert area was marked by a long cordon of
ticket booths, where the Gerry Foundation, which now owns the
Yasgur fields and organized this weekend's event, charged a $35
daily admission per person. (Admission was free for children under
12.)
</P>
<P>
   Event organizers said that 12,000 tickets had been sold for
Friday and that 4,000 to 6,000 children had come in free. As it is
currently set up, the Woodstock site can accommodate 30,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers said they expected the numbers to grow as the
weekend wore on. The performers Saturday included some brand-name
1960s rockers like Richie Havens, Lou Reed, Joni Mitchell and Pete
Townshend. Organizers, however, said they expected the largest
attendance on Sunday when '90s bands, including the Goo Goo Dolls
and Third Eye Blind, are scheduled to play.
</P>
<P>
   To get down the hill to where the musicians were performing on a
state-of-the-art sound stage (the same stage that Garth Brooks
performed on in Central Park), audience members had to pass by a
wide area of vendor tents where booths hawked an array of '60s
memorabilia and all types of food.
</P>
<P>
   For $20, Cornelius Alexy was selling peace sign necklaces
fashioned from pieces of the ``original'' chain-link fence that
surrounded the Yasgur property in 1969 _ complete with a
certificate of authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, pastrami and corned beef sandwiches could be
purchased for $7 each. A combination plate of Chinese food cost $6.
For the more health conscious, there was also a fruit and juice
bar.
</P>
<P>
   As the folk singer Melanie began to play Saturday morning,
opening the second day of this event, which is being called ``A Day
in the Garden,'' there were already lines at a bank of Bell
Atlantic public telephones and at the portable automatic teller
machines that were trucked in by Fleet Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Krier, 21, of Milltown, N.J., who was waiting to withdraw
money, said he and his friends had made been making an annual
camping trip to the Woodstock site here since the summer of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not real big on the vendors and stuff, and the ticket
prices are expensive,'' Krier said. He said rules banning audience
members from bringing in food and refreshments had forced him to
get cash from the ATM.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many people, however, said the event was well-organized and
despite the commercialism, it offered comforts _ like dozens and
dozens of portable toilets _ that were not available at the '69
Woodstock. Organizers said they tried to modernize without
undermining the event's hippie soul.
</P>
<P>
   Changes were made above and below ground. ``We built six miles
of interior roads,'' explained Michael DiTullo, a vice president of
the Gerry Foundation, adding that wells were drilled, an
underground water system was installed and five miles of split-rail
fence were put up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We developed 10,000 parking spaces,'' DiTullo said. ``Not with
blacktop of course, with green, with grass.'' He said the
foundation has big dreams for Bethel including the possible
development of rock-and-roll resort hotels. ``This will be the
venue of the next millennium,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, the fans said they came for the music. ``We
came in on Thursday and set up the tent, and Don Henley was tuning
up,'' said Mike McGrath, of Newburgh, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' he said. ``I went out fishing, just sat on the
boat and listened to tunes for three hours.'' The commercialism, he
said, ``is bound to happen over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles from the concert site, at Max Yasgur's old
farmhouse, some stalwart defenders of Woodstock Nation held a rally
to protest the commercialism and corporate invasion of Woodstock.
Several hundred aging hippies camped in the field and woods
surrounding the house.
</P>
<P>
   But such politicking was not going to keep Gwynne Watkins, an
18-year-old Joni Mitchell fan from Richmond, N.J., from recapturing
the essence of a bygone era. ``There aren't enough concerts like
this,'' she said. ``Everything is always enclosed, where you can't
meet anybody and you can't see anybody.''

WILLIAM CHICK, 60, DIABETES RESEARCHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By FORD BURKHART    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. William L. Chick, a physician and researcher who suffered
from diabetes from the age of 11 and lost his own battle with it
after a career dedicated to developing technology to help other
diabetics, died on Monday at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton,
Mass. He was 60 and lived in Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Chick was a leader in the field of cell therapy, which involves
transplanting animal cells to treat diseases, including diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Joslin Clinic in Boston in the 1970s, he developed early
ideas for a plastic pancreas implant the size of a hockey puck.
Then in the 1980s, at the University of Massachusetts Medical
School, he created the technology to implant tiny,
insulin-producing animal cells, called islets, said Dr. Denise
Faustman, who studied with Chick and is now a professor at Harvard
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found ways to get islet cells to survive long term, using
what he called barrier isolation,'' Dr. Faustman said. ``It was
sort of like plastic Baggies that kept out the cells that would
attack the islet.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months before Chick's death _ even after he went
blind, received a kidney transplant, suffered a heart attack and
stayed alive through nightly dialysis, often with high fevers and
shingles _ he worked in his laboratory to develop technology,
finally testing the implants of tiny cells as factories to produce
insulin, said his wife, Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   The key was a plastic membrane that allowed live animal islet
cells to send insulin into a diabetic's blood while keeping out the
much larger cells that trigger rejection of the animal cells. The
products are still in preclinical trials, said an associate, Jack
Hayes, chief operating officer of Biohybrid Technologies in
Shrewsbury, Mass., a company the two men started in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In diabetes, the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin, which
allows sugar in the blood to enter cells. Uncontrolled diabetes can
cause atherosclerosis, a blood-vessel disease that destroys the
kidneys. Chick suffered all of the debilitating effects of
diabetes, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   By releasing automatic doses of insulin into the blood, the
implanted islet cells have kept laboratory animals with diabetes
healthy for months. Chick thought islet cells gathered from the
pancreas of a pig could be used in such a device because they would
produce insulin similar to that of humans. That approach is already
used in standard insulin therapy for diabetics. The use of such
transplants of cells or organs is an example of a technique called
xenotransplantation, and Chick was an early leader in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Chick became a professor of biochemistry and medicine
at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester,
where he was recruited to organize a federally financed
Diabetes-Endocrinology Research Center. The center opened the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   He was its director until 1991, when he left to work full time
with Biohybrid Technologies, where he was president and scientific
director.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chick was one of the early contributors to cellular medicine, or
cell therapy, which involves the treatment of disease with living
cells, rather than a manufactured drug. He also worked on ways to
apply cell therapy to hemophilia, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy,
Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill was clearly an opinion leader in diabetes research,''
Hayes said. ``He was one of the pioneers in cellular medicine and
tissue engineering.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick was born in New York and received a bachelor's degree from
Columbia University and an M.D. from New York University in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Alyssa
Jennifer, a student at Georgetown University, and Elizabeth
Katherine, a student at Emory University.

SOLITARY EX-SEAMAN, 81, FOUND SLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a half-century at sea, circling the globe on
merchant ships, Harold Williams had finally found a safe harbor in
his ramshackle house on a quiet street on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   There, he lived a life as unhidden and uneventful as that of a
goldfish in a bowl. In fact, it was because his always-open front
door was unaccountably closed that a neighbor went to check on him
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   She found Williams, 81, lying near the door, his face bloodied
from several blows to the head. Police have made no arrests in the
slaying, though they say Williams probably knew his attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Officers do not know the motive for the killing, said Detective
Robert Walsh of the New York City Police Department. Perhaps it was
robbery, but Williams had little to be stolen.
</P>
<P>
   And on South Avenue, in Mariners Harbor, where he lived,
violence and serious crimes ``are highly unusual,'' Walsh said.
``These are working people who own their homes and are very
concerned about keeping up the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   For about 15 years, since his retirement as a merchant seaman,
Williams was a fixture on the little street. Shortly before noon
every morning, he would open the front door and sit just inside to
wait for the mail and the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mail was the highlight of his day,'' said the neighbor who
found him, a 44-year-old woman living in the other side of his
duplex, who spoke on the condition that her name not be used. In
return for free housing, she cleaned his house once a week and
drove him to the grocery store every two weeks for the dozens of
frozen dinners he heated twice a day in the microwave. ``The dog in
the yard and the mail in the box _ that's what he lived for.''
</P>
<P>
   A taciturn man who devoured paperback mysteries and war tales,
he apparently enjoyed discussing a few topics with a neighbor,
Martin Vuvek, 47. ``Warfare and tanks, especially Russian tanks,''
Vuvek, 47, said. ``And dinosaurs. He had a whole thick set of books
on dinosaurs.''
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Williams nearly lost a hand when his ship
was torpedoed near Murmansk, in the Soviet Union. After the war,
his work took him from England to Portugal, from Hong Kong to
Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He visited all the things that were worthwhile seeing _
bullfights, statues in cities, museums,'' said David Bruce, an old
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a printer who grew up in the Hell's Kitchen section
of Manhattan, Williams was a seaman before he was 20, said Bruce,
87, who was his best friend for nearly 70 years. The two met in
Hell's Kitchen, where they played ball in the streets and ``hung
around together,'' said Bruce, a retired electrician in Kingston,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd go out on ships for two, three months,'' Bruce said. ``He
tended the water, fired the boilers, watched the gauges. He liked
coming home and getting off the ship with a pocketful of money.
We'd have a few beers, go to cowboy movies on 42nd Street. Double
date.''
</P>
<P>
   Over beers, they would talk about women. ``He was kind of shy,
but he figured someday she'd come along,'' said Bruce, a widower.
Years later, Williams told his housekeeper that he had once met
someone special during a layover in Portugal. But he never married.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was afraid to get married _ afraid he'd not be treated
right,'' Bruce said. ``He was afraid of getting hurt by a friend or
a woman. He wouldn't take no chances. He wouldn't even take a
promotion on a better job. He stayed with the things he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried about being cheated, he hoarded his money, Bruce said.
Though Williams could be unexpectedly kind, adding $20 to his
housekeeper's $5-an-hour wages on her birthday, he was suspicious
of strangers and worried about crime.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was well into his 70s, he finally gave his heart
away without reserve _ to a stray puppy he found on South Avenue
and named Brownie. ``He loved that dog so much,'' Bruce said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams gave Brownie a bed _ a mattress, box springs and frame
_ and fed him the most expensive dog food. When Brownie became so
frail that he had to be put down, Williams was depressed for
months, said Bruce, who visited to cheer up his old friend.
``Brownie did so many things for him. When the phone rang, he'd
bark and run over to him. That dog would sort of talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year after Brownie's death, Williams finally settled on
a replacement, a smart and sweet-tempered mongrel with long black
hair. He bought the dog, named Manatee, for $50, and he never
closed the door between him and the dog. When Williams' body was
discovered, Manatee was alone in the front yard. &QL;

<P>
   Anna Jane Harrison, an emeritus professor of chemistry at Mount
Holyoke College and the first woman to be president of the
150,000-member American Chemical Society, died on Aug. 8 at Holyoke
Hospital. She was 85 and lived in nearby South Hadley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, the college said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harrison was born on a farm in Benton City, Mo. Her early
education was in a one-room country school, and she returned to
teach there for two years after graduating from the University of
Missouri in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   She then earned an M.A. and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry, also
at Missouri, and started her college teaching career at Sophie
Newcomb College of Tulane University in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the faculty at Mount Holyoke College as an assistant
professor in 1945, rose to professor in 1950 and headed the
department of chemistry from 1960 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
   She became the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Chemistry in
1976 and held that post until she retired in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harrison received 20 honorary degrees and won awards from
the American Chemical Society in 1977 and 1982 for her
contributions as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   She was active in the society for 62 years and became its
president, for a one-year term, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harrison also served on the National Science Board in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she was a longtime board member of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1984 became its
president.
</P>
<P>
   She has no immediate survivors.

 By CHRISTOPHER DREW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When prisoners entered the special disciplinary ward,
they often received ``greeting beatings'' from the guards as a
portent of the brutality to come. At other times, jail supervisors
ordered assaults on antagonistic inmates, and serious head
injuries, bone fractures and broken eardrums were common. One
prisoner died from an avalanche of blows.
</P>
<P>
   This gruesome litany sounds like an Amnesty International report
on a backwater country. But it all happened in the past decade at
New York City's massive jail complex on Rikers Island, as
correction officers and inmates battled for control of the most
violent section, informally dubbed the ``House of Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   And the full picture of the bare-knuckled punishment meted out
by the guards, including some who laughed about it over beer, is
only now emerging from court records, mainly as a result of a legal
settlement last month spelling out a series of reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials at the city's Department of Correction say they
have wiped out the worst problems, and they agreed to settle a
class-action lawsuit by 15 prisoners to avoid greater restrictions
on the jail. Bernard Kerik, the department's commissioner,
acknowledged in an interview last week that abuses had occurred and
that jail officers had covered them up. But he said that over the
last three years, the agency had cleaned up its operations as part
of an effort to reduce tensions and improve security within city
jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' he said, ``there was never the internal
oversight and control that there is today.'' Injuries to prisoners
have been ``substantially reduced,'' he said, adding: ``Are
prisoners being beaten into submission? Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for the rights of prisoners say there are
lingering problems at Rikers' disciplinary ward, the Central
Punitive Segregation Unit, which houses a constantly changing cast
of more than 400 inmates who have committed infractions in the
island's 10 jails. Some national prison analysts said they had
never seen a jail where excessive force was so routine, and one
expert, Vincent Nathan, said in a report that at least through the
mid-1990s Rikers' punitive unit occupied ``the third ring of hell
in the field of corrections in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the combustible atmosphere in many prisons and jails, and
the fact that force is often justified in subduing inmates, it is
not clear how many Rikers inmates were injured as a result of
deliberate beatings. But court records show that since the central
disciplinary unit opened in 1988, guards have used force to control
inmates more than 1,500 times, and at least 300 prisoners have
suffered serious injuries, many from blows to the head or to the
body that damaged internal organs.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records show that more than 50 of them had broken bones,
and up to 35 had perforated eardrums _ a painful injury that often
causes hearing loss. Doctors say it normally takes a hard punch or
kick directly to the ear to cause that type of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the damaged eardrums, Kerik said, ``That kind of
thing doesn't happen here any more.'' Still, the settlement of the
prisoners' suit, approved by a federal court on July 10, requires
the city to expand training in ways to subdue inmates without using
force and to do more to root out improper behavior by correction
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with a culture as deeply imbedded as this
one, it's going to take a strong commitment by the agency to
identify wrongdoing and impose discipline where appropriate,'' said
Jonathan Chasan, a Legal Aid Society lawyer who represented the
prisoners in the suit. But given the department's willingness to
settle the case, he said, ``This is something we expect to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chasan said he was concerned about several incidents in
June and July in which prisoners in the disciplinary unit were
injured in the face and head in altercations with guards. Kerik
said the department is investigating the incidents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Records from the Legal Aid Society suit, including depositions
and city documents that had not previously been released, show that
the allegations of abuse first surfaced within the agency shortly
after Rikers' officials opened the central disciplinary unit. One
prisoner died in 1990, and medical examiners concluded that it was
the result of a severe beating he had received from several guards.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the city also has paid more than $2 million to
settle lawsuits by prisoners who claimed they were improperly
beaten in the unit, and several correction officers have been
convicted of criminal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But other officers were acquitted of similar charges, and the
extent of the abuse has always seemed murky. And while there is no
question that the disciplinary unit was a tough setting, a close
review of the court documents, including more than a dozen
depositions of former guards, wardens and other correction
officials, suggests that for years, poor training and weak
supervision left many guards with the feeling that they could rough
up recalcitrant inmates whenever they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that some inmates received multiple head
wounds in beatings that occurred even though they were wearing
handcuffs. Many were ``beaten down,'' as the guards put it, in
isolated locations, sometimes for mouthing off. A few had their
heads held in toilet bowls while guards flushed the toilets.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, some of the guards' actions to cover up what they
did were so transparent that they were almost comical. Besides
routinely filing false reports, some correction officers punched
and kicked one another _ or rubbed carbon paper on their cheeks to
create ``bruises'' _ to support claims that they had been acting in
self-defense, the documents show. After the city began to clamp
down in the mid-1990s, the guards sometimes disabled video cameras
that monitored the jail by pointing them at the ceiling or floor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while a few were disciplined, most were able to get away
with this rough-hewn approach because their bosses felt it was
necessary to keep control of the often-rebellious crowd of inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Phoenix, who was the warden of the jail that housed the
disciplinary unit, said he periodically heard allegations that some
guards had repeatedly beaten inmates, and ``I had some suspicion
that they were overreacting in some instances.'' But he ``couldn't
get a grip'' on halting the brutality, he said, adding that it was
``ingrained in the culture because it's a natural reaction because
of the element that you're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   One result of that hands-off approach was evident when a
prisoner in the disciplinary unit, Anthony Bryant, died in May 1990
shortly after he was beaten by guards. According to Phoenix's
deposition, one of his subordinates asked a supervisor who had a
reputation for being overzealous to investigate the case. Even
Phoenix said the result was ludicrous: the supervisor turned in a
report three days after the death saying that Bryant should be
arrested for assaulting the staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Legal Aid Society filed its lawsuit on behalf of the 15
prisoners in 1993, and the city agreed in February 1996 to pay $1.6
million in damages to them. The second phase of the suit, settled
last month, focused on reforms. Starting in March 1996, the
Correction Department tried to fix the problems by moving the
disciplinary unit to a newer facility at Rikers, where it mounted
nearly 300 cameras on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   But the court records show _ and department officials
acknowledge _ that the first several months in the new building
marked a difficult period. Prisoners were injured in altercations
with guards outside the range of the cameras. When squads of
officers extracted rebellious inmates from their cells, they were
supposed to record the events with hand-held video cameras, but
often failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Kerik said, the department has taken additional
steps, from changing leadership at the jail to giving guards better
training in using nonviolent holds and pepper spray to disable
hostile inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik, who became the commissioner in January after serving as
first deputy commissioner for three years, said conditions also
have improved as part of an effort by the Giuliani administration
to reduce all kinds of violence in the jails. Department statistics
show that though the number of inmates in the city's system is
rising, the number of stabbings and slashings among prisoners has
declined by more than 80 percent since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Kerik said the city had stepped up searches for weapons and
begun charging violent inmates with new crimes, instead of just
giving them detention. He said this has made the jails safer for
guards and inmates alike.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Kerik tries to resolve the legacy of problems at the
central disciplinary unit, he faces hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Chasan, the Legal Aid lawyer, said he remains concerned about
whether the cameras in the jail are being used properly. He said
that in late July, after the final settlement of the Legal Aid
Society suit, a prisoner's face was lacerated in a fight with
guards right after a hand-held camera was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the unions that represent correction officers and
captains are worried about some aspects of the court settlement.
Peter Meringolo, the president of the Correction Captains
Association, said he was trying to negotiate to have his members
rotated out of duty in the disciplinary unit every 12 to 14 months
to reduce the stress.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, approved by Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. of
U.S. District Court in Manhattan, includes a provision for two
outside consultants to advise the department on changes and monitor
what goes on in the disciplinary unit over the next two years. The
judge could intervene again if the city fails to fix the problems,
but Kerik said he was determined not to let that happen. &QL;

IOC NEEDS TO SHOW WILL TO WIN DRUG FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DORIANE LAMBELET COLEMAN and JAMES E. COLEMAN Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The need for the International Olympic Committee's drug summit
is obvious after a summer of drug busts at the Tour de France and
the suspensions of the Olympians Michelle Smith de Bruin, Randy
Barnes and Dennis Mitchell. But if the primary agenda is to
redefine doping, as IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch has
suggested, the effort will be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch has said in recent weeks that the list of banned drugs
could be drastically reduced by permitting the use of
performance-enhancing substances that are not a threat to an
athlete's health. Such a redefinition not only would be cynical, it
would be morally indefensible and reveal a lack of commitment to
deal honestly and effectively with drugs. Beyond that it would not
fix what is broken.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC will meet Thursday to set the agenda for January's
summit. If the summit is to be useful, it must address the three
principal sources of the current chaos.
</P>
<P>
   First, the summit should address why the IOC and its constituent
organizations lack the will to do what is necessary to stay ahead
of cheaters and what is necessary in the short run to catch up.
These organizations have long complained that athletes are able to
frustrate their efforts by keeping one step ahead of the IOC
laboratories. Time magazine's Aug. 10 cover story, ``Chasing the
Cheats,'' is only the most recent article to accept this as gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes undoubtedly have access to the latest designer drugs,
but the IOC has never devoted sufficient funds for basic
drug-related or performance-related research. Nor has it
systematically equipped all of its laboratories with the latest
diagnostic equipment, or paid for the investigations necessary to
establish doping in an individual case.
</P>
<P>
   This problem is compounded by the default of drug control
authorities who recognize that they lack the resources necessary to
challenge what they see as the rampant use of drugs. Rather than
demanding more money, these officials take slipshod measures to
cope. The IOC and international federations routinely add
substances to the banned list about which they know nothing, based
solely on rumors that athletes are taking them, hoping to enhance
performance. This is the case, for example, with various
over-the-counter supplements believed to convert to testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Such scientific illiteracy is appalling, particularly as the
organizations subsequently base prosecutions on these mystery
drugs. The suspensions of Randy Barnes and possibly that of Dennis
Mitchell may fall into this category. Antidoping efforts must be
based on science, not rumors and hunches.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the summit must address the failure of the IOC to
discharge its responsibility to design a fair and professional
process for adjudicating doping disputes. Authorities should punish
athletes who are guilty of doping violations. At the same time,
however, to assure that innocent athletes do not fall victim to an
arbitrary system, they must conduct doping proceedings in a fair
and timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   This includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Setting up a process that is independent of the governing
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assuming a burden of proof that reflects the extraordinary
severity of any sanction that ultimately might be levied.
</P>
<P>
   _ Basing charges only on credible scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Protecting the confidentiality of innocent athletes who are
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Standardizing the doping rules and appellate procedures so
that athletes are not simultaneously subject to the jurisdiction of
multiple organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Several federations have independently tried to do some of these
things, but unless the IOC mandates them, none of these protections
will be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, as the authorities repeatedly say, that it is more
difficult to suspend athletes accused of doping when civil laws
create conflicting rights, lawyers aggressively defend them, and
judges routinely intervene. On the other hand, we must get beyond
the plantation mentality that casts the world's athletes as slaves
to masters in Lausanne, Switzerland, or Monte Carlo. Until a fair
and efficient mandatory process is established, athletes, lawyers,
judges and the public will continue to question the integrity of
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has a head start in creating such a process. Its
quasi-independent Court of Arbitration for Sport is a model for a
proper appellate review body. Despite its location on IOC grounds
in Lausanne, Court of Arbitration rulings have reflected
extraordinary independence and fairness. Its jurisdiction needs to
be made mandatory. Issues would remain concerning how members of
the Court should be appointed and what the scope of its
jurisdiction should be, but this is an area where some progress has
already been made.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the summit should address the overarching effect of the
Olympic Movement's all-pervasive concern about image. This concern,
although understandable from a corporate perspective, creates
inherent conflicts of interest that ultimately are the Achilles'
heel of its doping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when we asked an Olympic official to intervene
against the International Amateur Athletic Federation, track's
world governing body, when it vindictively sought to proceed
against Mary Slaney, he responded, ``Even if she is innocent, how
can we publicly help you without looking like we are soft on
drugs?''
</P>
<P>
   A similar attitude was reflected when FINA, the governing body
for swimming, suspended de Bruin for allegedly submitting a
contaminated urine sample even though FINA does not know how _ and
therefore whether _ she contaminated the sample. A FINA official
defended the decision on the ground that it would have sent the
wrong message not to suspend her.
</P>
<P>
   These are the inevitable and indefensible reactions of
organizations that seek to raise enormous amounts of money and
simultaneously keep their drug control efforts in-house. The IOC
and its constituent organizations cannot serve both masters.
Athletes should not be punished or assisted depending on the effect
it might have on fund-raising. The summit therefore should consider
as a fundamental matter the obvious merits of spinning off its
doping control efforts to an independent entity of professionals,
one that is not a stepping stone for personal advancement in the
Olympic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if any of this is to be accomplished, the IOC must
invite not only the usual institutional suspects, but also
outsiders who are respected and have expertise in the relevant
areas of concern. This includes specialists in science and law, as
well as athletes who can discuss the state of drug use in Olympic
sports or their experiences with the drug-testing and hearings
processes.
</P>
<P>
   Without such independent voices, the IOC's latest attempt to
address its drug control problems will likely devolve into a public
relations effort. Ultimately, however, integrity is the best
protection for the image of the Olympic Movement. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ In one of the deadliest paramilitary attacks
ever in Northern Ireland, a car bomb killed at least 20 people
Saturday and wounded more than 100 in the town of Omagh, 55 miles
west of Belfast, the capital of the British province.
</P>
<P>
   The blast raised fears for the survival of the Northern Ireland
peace agreement between majority Protestants and minority Roman
Catholics, as the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic
watched scenes of spilled blood and destruction on evening
television news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was carnage,'' said Nigel O'Kane, whose pub is a few
hundred yards from the explosion. It happened at about 3 p.m., a
half hour after the bombers made an apparently misleading phone
call to a newspaper warning that a bomb would be detonated.
</P>
<P>
   The caller, giving a code name recognized as one used by the
Irish Republican Army, according to police, said the bomb would go
off near the court house. Police moved crowds of shoppers several
hundred yards away from the court house, but the bomb exploded at
the spot where the shoppers had been moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's ever happened in this town in such a long time,''
O'Kane said, adding, ``There are a lot of people in tears,
panicking, looking for their loved ones. They don't know if they're
dead or injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Local hospitals called for blood donors and volunteer doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Several shops were devastated, and the streets, one-half mile
from the center of town, were covered with rubble as British
soldiers, police, firefighters and paramedics searched for
survivors and more dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is blood everywhere,'' said Ken Maginnis, a member of
the British Parliament and a leader of the mainstream Protestant
Ulster Unionist Party. Although no one initially claimed
responsibility for the blast, he said it was obvious that the
bombers were a Catholic Republican splinter group opposed to the
peace accord that was approved in May in a referendums in the North
and here in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Dublin to crack down on the group, which is
believed to operate out of the Irish Republic, calling itself the
real IRA, and crossing the border into the North for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has been observing a cease-fire for 13 months and the
dissidents feel the peace agreement is a sellout of republican
goals, particularly the establishment of a unified Ireland with the
mostly Protestant north subsumed in the overwhelmingly Catholic
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said the blast was ``the most
horrific act in years, a tragic day.'' He said the Irish Republic
would seek ``to crush these people.'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair called the blast ``an appalling attack of savagery and
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Paddy McGann, a local official in Omagh, said the Protestants
and Catholics in the town had lived peaceably together, free of
terrorist attacks for years. He noted that the attacks, attributed
to Catholic dissidents, came on the Assumption of the Blessed
Virgin, an important feast day for Catholics.

   ``I hope whoever did this say their prayers tonight,'' he added.

   The governments of Britain and the Irish Republic, sponsors of
the peace effort, have repeatedly stated that terrorism by
dissident groups would not destroy the peace effort, under which a
new Northern Ireland Assembly convened in June to work out a new
political structure that would give Northern minority Catholics
more power.

<P>
   But Saturday's attack could lead to retaliation by Protestant
paramilitaries, which in turn would put pressure on the IRA to end
its cease-fire and return the province to the sectarian warfare
that has killed more than 3,200 people since 1969. &QL;

EDITORIAL: NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Unlike any of his modern predecessors, Bill Clinton seems to
believe that he lives beyond the reach of public disappointment.
Otherwise, how could he talk about picking an architect and having
Hollywood raise $100 million for his presidential library while at
the same time allowing his aides to release the oddest trial
balloon ever to float from the West Wing?
</P>
<P>
   We are now advised that the president of the United States may
argue for continuance in office by telling a grand jury that he
received oral sex, but that, in his view, the act did not
constitute sexual relations since he did not touch any of the
female body parts specified by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is implausible. But the first thing that must be
said goes not to Clinton's survival strategy, but to the nation's
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, this presidency is a shell. For those who
place Democratic Party dominance above all other civic values, the
situation may seem tolerable. For many others, it is wrenching to
know that most Americans believe that this president will not,
cannot tell the full truth even if he is put under oath.
</P>
<P>
   It is also part of the national burden to know that whatever
Clinton may have said in the past, he will usually insist on some
retroactive interpretation that renders our language meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, this president will speak again. To avoid the sin of
prejudgment, let us say that we hope his testimony will be replete
and truthful and that soon afterward he will go on television and
explain everything to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Even at this late date, that catharsis might allow some measure
of renewal in the White House and set a belatedly positive example
for the nation. There is hardly a former Clinton aide now
commentating on the networks who has not told him that both duty
and the viability of his leadership demand such actions.
</P>
<P>
   But experience makes us guess that Clinton and his lawyers will
head in a different direction in order to pop through a window of
survival that has opened in the last week. The Lewinsky chapter of
the president's crisis is moving from its legal to its
congressional phase. On Capitol Hill, the Watergate comparison is
taking hold. Some prominent Republicans believe that Clinton should
not get the same punishment for a consensual sexual encounter that
President Nixon got for violating the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In survivalist mode, Clinton's approach before the grand jury
would be to offer a confession that contains enough truth to
prevent Kenneth Starr from showing that outright perjury was
committed and then to count on congressional restraint and public
opinion to forestall impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That is probably a sound political bet, providing that no
incontrovertible evidence regarding perjury or subornation of
perjury comes out. There is also a perception that a new wave of
public feeling _ whether you call it sympathy, revulsion or simple
weariness _ is working for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That is true, up to a point. But a new CNN/USA Today poll
indicates some limits to his ability to ignore public expectations
for presidential truthfulness. Only 26 percent said they would lose
confidence in Clinton if he confessed to an affair, while over half
said they would lose confidence if he canceled his testimony or
refused to answer questions. The same poll found that 57 percent
want an investigation of campaign finance, a step we have long
regarded as essential however the Starr inquiry ends.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno gave herself until late August to
consider the recommendation of Louis Freeh, the director of the
FBI, and Charles La Bella, her lead prosecutor on campaign finance,
that she appoint an independent counsel to look into fund raising
during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The questions of whether the Chinese government funneled money
to the Democrats and how the White House got hold of millions in
illegal Asian contributions and ushered suspicious characters into
presidential meetings remain unanswered. These matters need to be
resolved by an independent figure who is not beholden to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the president ought to be a truthful citizen is an
old one, but there is still life in it. The millions of Americans
who are not knee-jerk party loyalists have had to learn that the
price of supporting this president as a custodian of his office is
high. Too often, they have been asked to endorse behavior that
ranges from the potentially criminal handling of campaign money to
casually ugly attacks on political critics.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Hillary Rodham Clinton's new charge that people
oppose this administration out of prejudice against Arkansas is
particularly daft. It is also an insult to the state and to a
nation that has in the past 35 years elected three Southerners born
into modest circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles of this administration do not arise from geography,
but from the conduct, attitude and style of this president and his
highly individualistic way of interpreting and describing reality.
He promised a presidency of compassion. He has, through the steady
avoidance of candor, been reduced to a presidency of tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The American people, one senses, are tired, but not bereft of
optimism. Already one feels the attention of the lustrous Republic
turning, as subtly as the seasons, toward 2000 and the prospect of
a presidency founded on openness and steady principle.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's commercial banks have finally agreed to pay fair
compensation to Jewish Holocaust survivors and their relatives. The
$1.25 billion settlement agreed to last week covers money the banks
retained from accounts of Nazi-era Jewish depositors and profits
made from handling Nazi gold and lending money to German companies
employing Jewish slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the Swiss government, whose central bank also made
large profits from trafficking in gold the Nazis looted from their
victims, neither contributed to nor endorsed the settlement. Even
so, the agreement provides that the Holocaust survivors and their
families who brought this case will pursue no further lawsuits
against the Swiss government or Swiss industrial companies on these
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened by the rise of Hitler, European Jews in the 1930s and
early '40s entrusted their savings and other assets to the banks of
neutral Switzerland. But Swiss banks betrayed that trust after the
war. With most of the original depositors dead or dispossessed, the
banks treated these Jewish accounts as dormant, retaining the money
in them rather than repaying it to survivors and family members.
</P>
<P>
   A commission headed by Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve
Board chairman, has been reconstructing the records of these
accounts. Swiss banks had already committed themselves to pay back
all reconstructed accounts in full, at present value, after the
Volcker report was complete. Recognizing that only a fraction of
the accounts would ever be tracked down, the banks also offered to
contribute a further $600 million to a ``rough justice'' account.
</P>
<P>
   But no settlement was reached until last week, when the banks,
under pressure from threatened financial sanctions by local
governments, including New York City and New York state, agreed to
combine their previous offers into a single fund, increase the size
of the package and begin payments right away.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement shows that people who have been grievously
wronged by history can achieve a measure of belated justice,
provided they fight for it persistently, and live long enough to
collect what they are owed.

NYC-AREA HEALTH CLUBS CONSOLIDATE AS MEMBERSHIP GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spurred by the rising popularity of health clubs
among people more interested in improving cardiovascular fitness
than parading toned pecs, two companies are aggressively expanding
in the New York City area. With investment dollars pouring into the
industry, scores of independent gyms and smaller chains are likely
to be absorbed by major chains over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   One fast-growing company, Town Sports International, the owner
of New York Sports Clubs, acquired 18 gyms in the area in recent
weeks _ 6 of them this month _ and is building or planning to build
7 more. The company, which is based in Manhattan and is the largest
owner of gyms in the city, now has 59 clubs in the area and 17
others throughout the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Bally Total Fitness, the nation's largest chain, runs 37 clubs
in the area and will soon open 7 more.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to build a dozen clubs in the area within two
years, part of a national strategy that calls for adding 22 new
clubs and buying 25 more each year, said company president Lee
Hillman.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid expansion of these companies comes at a time when
growing numbers of mom and pop operations and less-successful
smaller chains across the country are eagerly seizing their first
opportunity to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is so fragmented that only about a third of the
nation's 13,799 commercial health clubs are owned by companies with
2 or more clubs, according to analysts. (Even Bally has only 325.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller operators have been waiting for years for the
opportunity to sell out,'' said Naomi Talish, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch. Until now, she said, ``there was no one out there with the
capital to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other industries undergoing consolidation, the $9 billion
health club business is not considered ``mature,'' meaning that
there appears to be plenty of room for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Club membership nationwide has increased sharply in recent years
_ to 22.4 million in 1997 from 13.8 million in 1987, according to
American Sports Data of Hartsdale, N.Y., a company that specializes
in sports and fitness research. But those figures represent only a
fraction of the potential market, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Health clubs are more popular in urban areas _ where the major
chains are concentrating their expansion drives _ but in the New
York area, only 1.6 million people are members, about 11.2 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
   With the mountain of research emphasizing the health benefits of
exercise, including a 1996 report by the surgeon general, club
operators say they believe that membership will continue to grow as
more people are recruited from what they euphemistically refer to
as the ``deconditioned'' market.
</P>
<P>
   Health clubs used to draw primarily from the 20-something age
group, but today, the members' average age is 35, said Cathy
Masterson McNeil, a spokeswoman for the International Health,
Racquet &AMP; Sportsclub Association, based in Boston. Last year, 8.5
million people ages 35 to 54 belonged to health clubs, an increase
of 103.3 percent over the 1987 figure. And the clubs had 2.7
million members age 55 or older, an increase of 123.5 percent over
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Some older club members began working out years ago and have
continued to stay fit, said Harvey Lauer, the president of American
Sports Data. But others have been lured by the development of
effective low-impact activities that are easy on the joints, he
said. ``I think there has been a general elevation of fitness
consciousness,'' Lauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting that heightened consciousness, Adele Bacon, 78, goes
to the David Barton Gym on Manhattan's Upper East Side four times a
week. Joining a gym with so many younger members made her feel
awkward at first, she said, but she quickly adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of people who walk around like prima
donnas,'' Mrs. Bacon said. But most people, she said, go to work
out. ``They're not here for a fashion show.'' Indeed, at many gyms,
form-fitting leotards and tights are far less prevalent than loose
track pants and baggy T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The health club industry has also caught the eye of investors,
because it has dropped some of its questionable business practices.
The days when operators made their money by signing up members who
could be counted on as no-shows are largely over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realized it was a very shortsighted strategy,'' said
Vincent Zinno, the editor of Club Industry magazine, a trade
publication. ``They were not growing their business doing that. It
was like selling a newspaper subscription to people who can't
read.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two companies, Bally and Sports Club Company, which owns
the luxurious Reebok Sports Club New York (with an initiation fee
of $1,100 and monthly dues of $150), are publicly traded. But
several other companies, including Town Sports International, are
expected to go public soon.
</P>
<P>
   With Reebok Sports Club New York at the wealthier end of the
clientele spectrum and muscle gyms at the other, Town Sports has
positioned itself in the middle, drawing college-educated people
between 25 and 40 who earn more than $50,000 a year, said Mark
Smith, the company's chairman and chief executive. Members who wish
to travel freely among various clubs pay $76 a month, he said, and
can cancel with 30 days' notice.
</P>
<P>
   To finance its expansion, Town Sports raised $100 million from
the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of its clubs are equipped with pools and
racquetball courts, the company is focusing on machines like
treadmills and stair climbers and popular activities like weight
training and spinning, a high-intensity workout using a stationary
bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's company is buying clubs from people like Christian
Pacifico, who entered the business in 1991, eventually becoming the
co-owner of Gold's Gym franchises on Staten Island and in Brooklyn
and Fort Lee, N.J., employing a total of 150 people.
</P>
<P>
   This year Pacifico decided it was time to sell because it was
getting harder to compete for employees and to keep updating
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so much a small business can do,'' said Pacifico,
who now works for Bally as an area manager. ``We were losing
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bally, part of the strategy is to diversify its membership.
Known for operating at the lower end of the market, the company
recently opened a slightly more high-end health club in Manhattan's
financial district and is upgrading several others in midtown. Fees
range from $25 to $45 a month at the typical Bally clubs, and from
$49 to $69 a month at the fancier ones, called Bally Sports Clubs.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry grows, club operators will inevitably be more
conscious of the bottom line, said Paul Roukis, an analyst at
Schroder &AMP; Company. But he said that the corporations would benefit
from economies of scale in marketing and acquiring equipment and
that consumers were not likely to feel that pennies were being
pinched because of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the contrary,'' Roukis said, ``it's going to give people a
lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Gary Prince, a chiropractor who owns Prescriptive
Fitness, an independent club on West 54th Street that charges its
members $60 a month, said that consolidation would deprive
consumers of the personal touch and hands-on management he is able
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the local bar on the corner, where everyone knows your
name,'' he said.

JETS LOOK TO PLEASANT FOR QUIET GUIDANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Anthony Pleasant does not sound like the
name of a defensive end, the mean guy who rushes the quarterback
from the blind side. He does not have the growling demeanor of one,
either. He is a quiet, albeit 6-foot-5-inch, 278-pound man in a
theatrical position.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant attended Tennessee State, a school that has produced
such outstanding defensive linemen as Ed (Too Tall) Jones and
Richard Dent. He may be in a boisterous position in football, but
he is far from flamboyant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say much,'' Pleasant said.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night, as the New York Jets face the Baltimore
Ravens in preseason play, Pleasant is to be matched against one of
the more intimidating players in the National Football League:
Jonathan Ogden, a 6-8, 318-pound left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   It is just another obstacle on the road back for Pleasant, who
has gone from being a potential Pro Bowl player with the Browns _
he had eight sacks in 1995 _ to diminishing seasons because of
injury. But of all the Jets' off-season pickups, Pleasant is the
only defender who has cracked the starting lineup. He is the right
end in the Jets' new 4-3 alignment.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive line is a potentially solid if unspectacular group
_ or one that could prove problematic. Pleasant and left end Rick
Lyle were both jettisoned by the Ravens, while the 1998 Jets
tackles' production is yet to be proved: Jason Ferguson is in his
second season with the team and Ernie Logan, who is entering his
eighth season in the league, was not a starter until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant, Lyle and Logan all played under Bill Belichick at
Cleveland. Behind them, the Jets' depth is thin.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells wishes he knew more about Pleasant and what
to expect from him.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' hopes were raised when the Jets defeated the
Philadelphia Eagles in their preseason opener.
</P>
<P>
   But then Pleasant sustained an ankle injury in practice.
Parcells growled at the strength coach, John Lott, who was working
with Pleasant, invoking the name of the Ravens' mountainous
offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the Ogden flu,'' a disgruntled Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant was back on the line two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he seemed angered that Pleasant was hurt, Parcells
said: ``I'm just counting on him to do well. His play against the
Eagles raised my expectation level, which is a bad thing to do
around me.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets altered their defense, they needed someone who
could play right end _ and quickly. The coaching hierarchy knew
about Pleasant even if Bill Parcells did not. Belichick, now
Parcells' assistant, was Cleveland's head coach when Pleasant
starred there, and Scott Pioli, now in charge of the Jets' pro
personnel, was in a similar position with the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick hoped, however, that Pleasant, who is 30 years old,
was more like his Browns self than he had been his last two seasons
at Baltimore and Atlanta. Pleasant had an ankle injury in Baltimore
and was a part-time player in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a solid guy and a good guy,'' Belichick said.
</P>
<P>
   Romeo Crennel, the defensive line coach, said of Pleasant: ``We
felt he would be a very consistent and good addition. What you
didn't know about was the last two years. It's always the question
mark. Can he get back to what he was?''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, then the Jets have made a significant move. They
would have a player who not only can rush the passer but is a solid
run stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our first team is stronger because all of them have
experience in the system,'' Crennel said. ``They play well
together, which is important, as opposed to having the one guy who
can star for you.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, stardom is not very likely. Pleasant has had his
moments, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Parcells didn't tell me much,'' Pleasant said. ``He just
told me he has a lot of expectations from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant also has a lot of expectations for himself. He
describes it as part of an overall ``way of life, not just being a
football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant is thinking of becoming a minister when his football
career ends, and he has also worked on special-education projects.
His wife, Renita, has a master's degree in urban planning and
psychology from the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you carry yourself in a certain way,'' Pleasant said,
``guys respect you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jets did not seem like the perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was skeptical about coming here,'' Pleasant said. ``I
thought Long Island was like New York City, traffic and all. And I
didn't really know what kind of coach he was. I have a different
perception now.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Pleasant thought Parcells was worse than he is?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, shaking off the Ogden flu.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens-Jets connection is wide-ranging. For starters, the
Jets' assistant head coach, BILL BELICHICK, coached the Browns for
five seasons. In addition to three members of the Jets' defensive
line who played for Cleveland or the Ravens, there was also
linebacker PEPPER JOHNSON, punter BRIAN HANSEN and the Jets' player
development director, CARL BANKS, who was a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   On the Ravens, meanwhile, the pro personnel director JAMES
HARRIS was a Jets assistant general manager. And the Ravens'
receivers coach, RICHARD MANN, had that position with the Jets. &QL;

WITH NICE VIEW AMID RUINS, RAIL YARD TO GET UPGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A rubble-strewn, overgrown Staten Island rail yard
with a postcard view of the Statue of Liberty and New York's
financial district could become an attraction itself under plans
announced Saturday by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the city had agreed to pay $13 million for 52
acres next to the St. George Ferry Terminal, and was considering
development that could include a minor-league baseball park, an
entertainment complex and restaurants and stores.
</P>
<P>
   Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari said the purchase
would create an attractive new face for the area, which many
residents consider the gateway to Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this stuff had been going to rack and ruin,''
Molinari said. ``This represents a new day for Staten Island. This
will have an enormous positive impact for Staten Island in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that 18 million people passed through the ferry
terminal each year, providing a base of potential customers
``bigger than most cities.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they had not decided how they would use the
land, but Giuliani mentioned a retail complex and said a ballpark
would be one of the most attractive options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone can see if they can hit home runs between the World
Trade Center towers,'' he joked. ``I can't think of anything better
than hitting home runs to Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible use would be additional space for two museums
now planned for the site: a national museum planned by lighthouse
preservation groups and a cultural center planned when the terminal
is expanded. The city also may continue to use part of the land for
parking, Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we do will be a tremendous improvement over what's
there,'' said Charles Millard, president of the Economic
Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the land, which runs 3,000 feet along the
waterfront, was first used as a rail yard near the turn of the
century, a use that continued into the 1960s. Now, part of it is a
1,000-space commuter parking lot and the rest is covered with scrap
and scrub, along with a few rusty flat-bed cars.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Economic Development Corp. is buying the land from
CSX Realty Development, a subsidiary of CSX Corp., the
international transportation giant. The city has 90 days to
complete the offer, which must be approved by the CSX board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we do will be a tremendous improvement over what's
there,'' said Charles Millard, president of the development agency.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the $13 million price was a good deal for the
city, since CSX had a contract to sell the land 10 years ago for
$18.5 million, although the deal did not go through. He said CSX
was now collecting $750,000 a year in parking fees from the
property, and had planned to double that to $1.5 million with the
opening of two museums nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I photographed this view myself, so I know how inspiring it
can be,'' said the mayor, who was dressed in a polo shirt as he
made the announcement on a sidewalk overlooking the property near
Borough Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said he was delighted and relieved by the purchase. In
the past, he said, developers and the city had considered using the
land for housing or a jail. ``Now the city is preserving it for
community use,'' Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
   About half the property, which sits just north of the ferry
terminal, is under water. The city is considering plans to renovate
the docks and shorefront.

MAYOR STEPS UP HIS CRITICISM OF METHADONE PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One day after detailing his plan to wean 2,000 heroin
addicts off methadone at city hospitals, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
stepped up his attack on methadone treatment programs Saturday,
accusing them of enslaving former drug users instead of pushing
them toward abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani sharply criticized drug treatment experts _ like
scientists at the National Institutes of Health; Gen. Barry R.
McCaffrey, the White House drug policy chief; and state officials _
who say decades of research show that methadone offers the best
hope for the vast majority of recovering heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani disputed their views Saturday, saying methadone
maintenance programs simply substitute one dependency for another,
leaving thousands of addicts tethered indefinitely to the synthetic
drug widely prescribed to blunt the craving for heroin.
</P>
<P>
   And the mayor seemed to relish the opportunity to steer the city
off the traditional course and to portray himself as an innovative
thinker who cares more about the poor than the drug treatment
specialists he assailed Saturday as a ``politically correct
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics and the advocates are just going to have to deal
with the fact that we have a different view on methadone than they
do,'' Giuliani said. ``I think methadone is an enslaver. It's a
chemical that's used to enslave people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's necessary for transition, then of course it should be
used for transition,'' he said. ``If you're going to keep somebody
permanently enslaved to methadone for the rest of their lives, then
I have real questions about your common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Under his new plan, which will begin in about 60 days, all
addicts enrolled in five city hospitals will be weaned from
methadone within several months, instead of taking it indefinitely
as they do now. City officials said most addicts would need only
about three months to make the transition to abstinence, although
each patient would be evaluated individually.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials, drug treatment specialists and even some
providers who run methadone-to-abstinence programs continued to
raise concerns about the mayor's plan, saying it goes too far by
completely eliminating methadone maintenance, which is desperately
needed by thousands of addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm alarmed that the city is taking this approach,'' said Ray
Diaz, a senior vice president at Samaritan Village, a drug
treatment program that offers a methadone-to-abstinence program for
58 heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This model doesn't work for everyone,'' Diaz said. ``We need a
number of different treatment models at city hospitals. Methadone
maintenance programs are vital.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials and drug rehabilitation specialists emphasized
that they were not dismissing the value of methadone-to-abstinence
programs. Of the 36,000 treatment slots for heroin addicts in New
York City's public and private clinics, about 1,000 are already
devoted toward abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   And Eileen Pencer, who runs such a methadone-to-abstinence
residential program for 90 addicts at the Lower East Side Service
Center, said she thought more heroin addicts would embrace the
approach if additional beds were available.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Mary Jeanne Kreek, who heads the Laboratory of Biology
of Addictive Diseases at Rockefeller University in Manhattan, said
drug research showed that such methadone-to-abstinence programs can
help only about 20 percent of all heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs have served an important role for a very
limited number of people,'' said Dr. Kreek, who has studied drug
addiction for 30 years. ``Unfortunately, most of those people,
between 70 and 90 percent, relapse to illicit opiate use in one
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani acknowledged Saturday that the new approach might not
work for everyone. But he said it was important to expand the
availability of methadone-to-abstinence programs so that addicts
could choose for themselves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Currently, he said, federal and state officials mistakenly spend
most of their dollars on methadone maintenance, making it difficult
for drug users to try anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's try it,'' Giuliani said of the new approach. ``It is
better to try to have abstinence work for increasing numbers of
people than having the situation that these doctors have brought
about. And the editorial board of The (New York) Times I would
include in the group that doesn't seem to really understand what
this is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of our society should be self-reliant people _ not
normalizing dependency,'' he said. ``What's happened is, the
treatment of choice now among all of these doctors is methadone _
35,000 people in that kind of treatment; only 15,000 people in
other kinds of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   As word of the mayor's plan trickled into the city's methadone
clinics, recovering addicts reacted with fear and approval. Steve,
a 32-year-old addict, who refused to give his last name, said,
``People are in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to be physically putting people into a position
where they're going to be sick, hurting, going on the street
without methadone looking for heroin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But another heroin addict, who declined to be identified, said
he supported the expansion of methadone-to-abstinence programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are determined to clean up your life and not abuse
drugs anymore, it would be good for you,'' he said.

AUSCHWITZ SURVIVOR FATALLY STRUCK BY CAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 76-year-old Brooklyn woman who survived the
Auschwitz concentration camp died late Friday after being hit by a
car near her home, police said. The driver fled in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Rifka Franzos, was trying to cross Wythe Avenue at
Rodney Street in Williamsburg shortly after 9:30 p.m. on Friday,
when a red car traveling north on Wythe hit her, said Officer
Dennis Laffin, a Police Department spokesman. An investigator who
spoke on condition of anonymity said that witnesses described the
car as a Ford Thunderbird, though they could not see the driver as
the car passed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Franzos later died at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health
Center, Laffin said.
</P>
<P>
   With her husband, Joel, the victim had been a longtime resident
of the heavily Jewish Orthodox neighborhood on the edge of the
Brooklyn Navy Yard and once owned a bakery on Broadway, neighbors
said. Police said the family lived on Ross Street, one block from
where Mrs. Franzos was killed as she took a walk on the Jewish
Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Franzos, who was born in Hungary, emigrated to Brooklyn in
1947, family members said, adding that she had been interred in the
Auschwitz death camp in Poland during World War II. She met her
husband, who was in a labor camp during the war, shortly before
they both moved to the United States, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Franzos opened a bakery on Grand Street in Williamsburg, while
his wife worked as a seamstress in a sweater factory, they said.
She worked in the factory, Dan Wall Finishing Co., until her death.
</P>
<P>
   She was on her way to pick up her husband from a relative's
house when the car struck her, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a horrible way for her to go after surviving the
Holocaust,'' Phil Franzos, her 45-year-old son, said. ``I'm still
in shock. My mother was a very strong, happy person who never
complained. She suffered a lot in the war, but you would never know
it by speaking with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will be dearly missed,'' he said. Mrs. Franzos is survived
by six children, 41 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren,
Franzos said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said the intersection where Mrs. Franzos died was
especially dangerous because no traffic lights had been installed.
``A few months ago, a car came flying around that corner and
knocked into my car where it was parked and totaled it,'' said one
man near the scene, who refused to give his name because of the
holy day. ``They need to put a light over there because people just
speed all the time.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THERE MUST BE 50 WAYS TO STRIP A BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty Second Job Aptitude Quiz: Take this test to
determine whether you have what it takes to be a Democratic party
boss in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: A Republican state senator who was unopposed last
election has taken positions that are unpopular with the many
immigrants in his district. A local school board official, who is
also an immigrant and an active Democratic party worker, volunteers
to run against him. Should you:
</P>
<P>
   A) Break out the champagne and offer up a novena of
thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   B) Prepare for a primary, since you have been actively
recruiting candidates yourself.
</P>
<P>
   C) Tell him you do not want to see the Republican senator
troubled with an opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations if you picked C! You have a promising future
within the New York Democratic Party. Everybody else will have to
consider careers in more vital industries, like blacksmithing.
</P>
<P>
   Morshed Alam, school board member and president of the New
American Democratic Club in Queens, was the candidate who
volunteered to run for the state Senate seat long held by the
Republican Frank Padavan. ``Frank Padavan, I feel, is
anti-immigrant, and for the last six years he didn't have any
opposition,'' said Alam, who came here 14 years ago from
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens Democratic chairman, Thomas Manton, was not pleased.
Alam said Manton told him that he wanted to give Padavan a free
ride so the senator's supporters would stay home in November,
making life easier for other Democrats in the area. ``They said my
candidacy could make Frank Padavan do more campaigning,'' reported
Alam, who nevertheless persisted in getting onto the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Let Sleeping Senators Lie theory is one of the many excuses
New York politicians find to skirt the dreaded prospect of actual
elections _ terrible, uncontrollable events in which voters are
unleashed to do any wild and crazy thing they want. There is only
one way to win an election in this state. But, to paraphrase Paul
Simon, there must be 50 ways to avoid having one.
</P>
<P>
   Quit late at night, Dwight. Don't make a fuss, Gus. Manton, who
is also a member of Congress, recently took advantage of a small
legal window of opportunity to retire and handpick his successor
without the fuss of a party primary. ``I've always wanted to be in
Congress,'' declared the lucky heir, Assemblyman Joseph Crowley,
who is best known for loyalty to Manton and a successful drive to
require the teaching of the history of the Irish potato famine in
public schools. Asked to describe the qualities that distinguished
Crowley from other Democrats who wanted the seat, Manton demurred.
``I can't give you chapter and verse,'' he said. By the next day,
he had settled on ``youth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Queens Republican organization, observing a Let Sleeping
Congressmen Lie rule, had not put up a candidate, and Crowley's
opposition in November will be a minor party candidate and a
political gadfly without organization or campaign funds. Privately,
the Republican leaders expressed no hard feelings. ``It was very
clever,'' said one. ``And of course Tom couldn't have allowed a
Democratic primary. It would have been a blood bath.'' (Snap Quiz:
A blood bath is another word for A) massacre, B) slaughter, C)
election.)
</P>
<P>
   Look for the slip, Chip. Take him to court, Mort. Meanwhile in
Brooklyn, Rep. Edolphus Towns was energetically attempting to
eliminate a primary challenger named Barry Ford through the classic
method of claiming that a woman who collected voter signatures on
Ford's behalf was not a registered Democrat residing in the
congressional district. This requirement goes back to the 1940s,
when state legislators wanted to make sure that communists from the
Soviet Union did not slip into East Harlem to collect signatures
for a left-wing congressman named Vito Marcantonio.
</P>
<P>
   These technical challenges are harder to make stick nowadays,
but they are still pursued through expensive court battles, all
over the state. A Democratic novice congressional candidate named
Dick Collins temporarily managed to knock the incumbent Republican,
Sue Kelly, off the ballot for failing to put numbers on her pages
of signatures. The most interesting part of that story was the
Democrat's refusal to acknowledge that any of Ms. Kelly's
constituents might have been upset in November when they went to
the polls and found nobody but Dick Collins on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Towns has not had a serious race in his 16-year career _
Republicans are as plentiful as musk oxen in the 10th Congressional
District. Yet the people fighting to get Ford tossed off the ballot
seemed absolutely dumbfounded by the suggestion that the district
voters would prefer having a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you feel that way about everybody in America?'' asked his
aide.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: 20 YEARS LATER, STILL NO TRACE OF 5 MISSING BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The five boys played basketball, then went home
for dinner. It was mid-August, the beginning of the end of summer,
and they had played pickup ball for hours, unfazed by the
knock-down heat of the court at West Side Park. Later, people would
remark that the youths played as if they knew the day would be
their last.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said that nothing about that day _ a Sunday _ was
much different from the one before it, or the one before that. It
was Aug. 20, 1978: hot and airless on the streets of Newark. Five
high school kids played hoops, went home, went back out. It was a
typical day for typical city teen-agers. Nothing detectives have
found shows that the five made plans to disappear that night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one can be sure. Twenty years later, almost as little
is known about Newark's biggest unsolved case, the sudden
disappearance of five healthy teen-agers, as on the day it
happened. They played basketball. They ate. They vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, it is still a missing persons case. No bodies or
body parts have turned up. Alvin Turner, Randy Johnson and Michael
McDowell, who were 16, and Melvin Pittman and Ernest Taylor, who
were 17, may still be alive somewhere, pushing 40. But police doubt
it. None of them have ever been spotted. None have ever been heard
from. Their Social Security numbers have not been used since they
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Police have followed scant leads. No doubt, a lack of publicity
has not helped. This extraordinary case received no
headline-grabbing stories, no televised interviews with family and
friends, no mention on milk cartons. There was no national campaign
calling for information or sightings. The five black youths never
entered the public consciousness the way some white, middle-class
missing children do.
</P>
<P>
   If the disappearance happened now, perhaps the world would know.
Then, there were no 24-hour news channels with bottomless appetites
for headlines, no 90-minute local reports, no World Wide Web. The
public was not media-savvy, ready to alert journalists at the first
whiff of trouble, the way it is now.
</P>
<P>
   All three New York City daily newspapers were on strike. And if
they had been publishing, it probably would have made no
difference. The local newspaper, The Star-Ledger of Newark, did not
have a story on the case at the time, either. No one knew but the
families and friends of the missing boys and the police.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, at the time, police believed that the only
explanation for the disappearance of five youths was that they had
just run away. But the families said all along that the boys were
not the sort to do that. Michael McDowell, who lived in East
Orange, got into trouble once for a fistfight. The other four,
sophomores and juniors at Weequahic High School, had been in no
trouble at all.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening they vanished, they got a ride home from the park
in a pickup truck from a contractor they knew as ``Big Man'' who
sometimes hired them to do odd jobs. After dinner, Michael was seen
in the back of the truck with another youth. The contractor, Lee
Anthony Evans, was questioned by police, given lie detector tests
and cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Every few years, often near the anniversary of the
disappearance, the Newark Police Department reviews the case. Two
years ago, two detectives followed a tip that a psychic, Dorothy
Allison, had given police 17 years earlier about where to find the
five bodies. She took them to a lot near Newark International
Airport, where she said the burned bodies of the youths had been
buried. But after a few days of digging, the police suspended the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two months later, another psychic came up empty at another
spot. Police have also tried, at various times, contacting Ouija
board readers, political and religious fringe groups and prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department's cold-case squad has the file now. But a
police spokesman, Sgt. Derek Glenn, could not say whether the
20-year-old mystery was a COLD cold case, or an active one. After
eight or nine phone calls over three days requesting interviews
with detectives or any information on the case, the requests were
denied. Glenn said he did not know that there was anything new to
say.

ANALYSIS: STRIP CLUB CRACKDOWN SUCCEEDS, AND RANKLES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Judges in Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx grant
requests from the Giuliani administration to padlock strip clubs
and adult video stores immediately. But judges in Manhattan and
Queens, confronted with nearly identical requests, refuse and
instead hold long hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictory responses are, in part, the result of novel
and aggressive legal tactics the Giuliani administration is using
to close sex shops under a new zoning law.
</P>
<P>
   To administration supporters, the tactics are producing the
first concrete results in efforts to restrict the shops to
manufacturing areas. To critics, however, the crackdown is the
latest example of the Giuliani administration's use of
heavy-handed, publicity-driven tactics to bully opponents into
submission.
</P>
<P>
   With seven judges in five boroughs wrestling with 18 requests
from the Giuliani administration to close sex shops, a series of
seemingly contradictory rulings regarding the new law could emerge
over the next several weeks. And rulings from state and federal
appeals courts on whether the enforcement tactics are legal _ as
well as on sex shops' efforts to stay in business by limiting adult
entertainment to less than 40 percent of their floor space _ are
not expected for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term, the Giuliani administration, by peppering
the courts with requests to close sex shops, is producing the
picture of an administration succeeding where other mayors have
failed since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration's zoning law to restrict adult
entertainment mirrors sex-shop regulations in other cities. But
what is unusual, critics say, is the combative way the mayor is
going about closing the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   City officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the
mayor is bypassing the usual method for closing a business
illegally operating in a residential area. Typically, in a process
that can take months, city officials first issue a notice of
violation to the business owner. Hearings are then held, and a
business can be ordered to move or find a way to comply with the
law.
</P>
<P>
   But in shutting the sex shops, the Giuliani administration is
using a legal procedure usually reserved for closing crack houses
and brothels. Requesting the padlockings under the city's nuisance
abatement law, city lawyers argue that the sex shops should be
immediately closed because they represent a threat to the public
``health, safety and welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strategy is working. The city has won 11 immediate
padlockings since the law took effect July 22. But other judges,
mainly in Manhattan and Queens, are taking longer to decide whether
to padlock, saying a zoning violation does not necessarily warrant
immediately closing a business.
</P>
<P>
   Administration critics say the long-running businesses are no
threat to public welfare. The city is distorting the issue, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do it this way is really Gestapo-like tactics,'' said
Herald Price Fahringer, the lawyer representing 107 of the 144 sex
shops affected by the new law. ``There isn't any question that it's
more volatile from a publicity standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator,
said the shops do pose a threat to public welfare by inhibiting
economic growth and reducing the quality of life in their
neighborhoods. The businesses are free to move to manufacturing
areas where they are allowed to operate under the new law, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a strategy, and it is an aggressive strategy,'' he
said. ``But everything we're doing is being done in full compliance
with the law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers for the sex shops also complained that the city was
filing its requests for immediate padlockings with no warning. They
said judges in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island were granting
the requests without lawyers for the sex shops being present to
argue their case.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, contended that the city was focusing on strip
clubs in counties where judges were most likely to issue immediate
padlock orders. He pointed out that since the judges handling the
sex shop cases in Manhattan and Queens turned down requests for
immediate closings, six of the last seven requests have been in the
Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's orchestrated,'' he said. ``The whole push is
gauged toward getting headlines to give the impression that he's
closing them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer said that since he sent a letter out asking judges not
to issue immediate padlock orders against his clients without his
presence, the city has not tried to padlock any of his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Fishner denied that the city was tailoring its padlocking
requests. ``It will become apparent over time that we are not
selecting any counties or avoiding any counties,'' Fishner said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the strip clubs also complained that the city was
using underhanded tactics. After Judge Steven Fisher turned down
the city's request for an immediate padlocking of Wiggles strip
club in Queens, the city produced a two-month-old affidavit from a
police officer who said that a dancer in the club solicited him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge cited the assertion of criminal activity as grounds
for padlocking the club.
</P>
<P>
   New York University law professor Michael Schill said the city
has the right to aggressively enforce a zoning law that has
withstood numerous challenges on its constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that the city feels that having an enforcement
action against one business is not going to lead to everyone
pulling down the shutters and giving up,'' he said. ``And they're
probably right.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's opponents concede that even if his tactics are later
overturned by higher courts, he is in a win-win situation. Owners
of padlocked businesses may eventually give up and move to
manufacturing zones, as permitted under the new law. The short-term
closings, they said, will also play well with the Republican
audiences the mayor will be addressing around the country in the
next few weeks.

<P>
   Richards Ruben, an abstract painter and teacher, died on July 21
in Venice, Italy, where he was teaching in the summer art program
of the Pratt Institute. He was 72 and lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Gail Divan, said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben's heavily worked surfaces tended to be dominated by one
color and one shape, a burly, wedgelike form that seemed to emerge
from a field of brushwork. Neither geometric nor gestural, his
style aligned him with the second generation of Abstract
Expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Los Angeles in 1925 and after serving in the U.S.
Army from 1942 to 1944, returned there to study art at the
Chouinard Art Institute. In the 1950s and early '60s, he was part
of the growing Los Angeles art world, exhibiting his work at two of
its most prominent galleries, Paul Kantor and Ferus. He moved to
New York in the early 1960s, exhibiting at the Poindexter Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben's teaching career began in the late 1940s and included
stints at Chouinard, the Pasadena Art Museum, Pomona College,
Claremont Graduate School, Cooper Union, New York University,
Columbia University and Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Ruben is survived by their daughter,
Caitlin Feron of Sag Harbor, N.Y.; a son from his first marriage,
John Ruben of Austin, Texas; and one grandchild.

   HYDE PARK, N.Y. _ At the Culinary Institute of America, where
chefs in training happily wake before dawn to chop onions and stay
up all night discussing the vagaries of risotto, the students were
rapt. The celebrity who left them stammering with awe was not Julia
Child nor any of her kind, but Stanley Tucci, co-writer,
co-director and star of the 1996 food-orgy film ``Big Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucci, with bleached-white hair and a studiously casual pose,
was at the United States' premier cooking school showing scenes
from his movie at the request of the student-run Saucier Club and
Giovanni Scappin, a chef and a professor at the institute who acted
as consultant to the film.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci, 38, and the students spoke for an hour and a half about
art, commerce, the immigrant experience and American culture _
anything but the eye-popping food scenes in ``Big Night'' that drew
so many gourmands into theaters. The film, which focuses on the
struggle of a businessman trying to keep his Italian restaurant
afloat and his brother, the chef, who refuses to compromise, was
never directed at food-lovers in particular, Tucci said. He said it
used food simply ``as a metaphor for the struggle of the artist in
contemporary society.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he hung his head and said with a sigh, ``That sounds so
much like Woody Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor said he learned how to chop vegetables and flip
frittatas when his friend and co-star, Isabella Rossellini,
introduced him to Scappin. Still, he was blunt about his own
culinary tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll eat anything,'' he said. ``A fish filet at McDonald's is
good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The students were far more interested in Tucci, the filmmaker.
After his presentation, they asked him to pose for pictures and
autograph their ``Big Night'' videocassettes. Their only
food-related question focused on how many eggs Tucci had eaten
while shooting the final sequence, in which his character, Secondo,
the struggling restaurateur, reconciles with his brother Primo over
an omelet (about 15 in five takes).
</P>
<P>
   It was a seafood risotto, among other things, that had nearly
driven the two apart, and this the students understood implicitly.
As Tucci spoke, some of them served plates of the tricky, demanding
rice dish to colleagues in the audience, who analyzed it afterward
the way literature majors might deconstruct a thesis on
``Ulysses.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``A little too al dente, but it had good flavor,'' said Marla
Kiel, 22, of Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely a labor of love,'' nodded 26-year-old Tasha Garcia,
from Miami. ``When I was in `Basic Skills,' my risotto wasn't
nearly as good.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sat talking outside the auditorium late into the
evening. At 5:30 a.m., they would be rising for ``Meat
Identification,'' the morning's first class, but said the chance to
listen to someone speak about something other than food had been
well worth staying up for.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of ``Big Night'' may find it hard to believe just how
little good eating took place during the film. The culminating
15-course dinner was little more than a nightmare for Tucci. His
actors were tired, the food (which appeared sumptuous) was actually
horrible and the studio was unbearably hot, he said. Shooting the
creation of a timpano _ an elaborate construction of meats,
vegetables and sauce, which is something of a culinary decathlon _
nearly drove him crazy.
</P>
<P>
   With so much aggravation, viewers might imagine that Tucci and
Tony Shalhoub, who played his brother, would have had little
trouble portraying the tension inside a restaurant kitchen. But
that, too, was a carefully crafted illusion with gestures
choreographed by Scappin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed them about the movement of the cooks in the kitchen,
the chopping, the wiping your hands constantly, all those things
that make you feel like you've been in the kitchen a long time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chef, who became friendly with Tucci's family during the
production, is now working on a cookbook with Tucci's mother. But
it will not be a compilation of recipes from the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could never be such a thing,'' Tucci said. ``That would
be anathema to the moral center of the film. `Big Night' was never
intended to be a food movie, though I'm glad people thought of it
that way because, well, people like food and they all went to see
it.''

BRISK SALES FOR HIGH-END HOMES IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARY McALEER VIZARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 93-unit Hardscrabble Lake luxury detached-house
development in the town of Mount Pleasant, N.Y., Jeffery Doynow has
sold almost as many homes in the first seven months of this year as
he did in all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, we've sold 15,'' said Doynow, managing partner of
Fortune Home Builders. ``Last year we sold 18, which was still
good, since these are mostly million-dollar homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since starting Hardscrabble Lake four years ago, Doynow has sold
a total of 60 homes. ``The pace has picked up each year, and prices
have increased by 30 percent,'' he said, noting that the project's
four-bedroom colonial and French Provencial-style houses now range
from $850,000 to more than $1 million, depending on size and
special features.
</P>
<P>
   Doynow said that projects like Hardscrabble Lake had benefited
not only by the bull market on Wall Street, combined with low
interest rates, but also from ``a scarcity of such developments
compared to the number of people who can now afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   All over Westchester County, N.Y., real estate agencies and
developers report brisk sales overall, with a higher proportion of
houses selling at the high end, or over $700,000, than in previous
years. The latest county Board of Realtors report, which does not
categorize sales in particular price ranges, nevertheless reported
a record-breaking second quarter for detached-house sales.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 1,708 homes were sold, the most ever recorded for a
second quarter, compared with 1,465 the same quarter last year, an
increase of 17 percent. The average price of $410,344 was 5 percent
higher than for last year's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the County
Board of Realtors, said that the second quarter was a ``very
powerful punctuation'' to a three-year trend of brisk sales across
the board, but with more attention being paid to high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Cohen, president of Cohen Properties in White Plains, N.Y.,
has enough faith in the continuing health of the market to build an
8,000-square-foot speculative house in Bedford, N.Y., that he hopes
to sell for $2.3 million. In addition, he recently acquired three
lots at Purchase Estates, N.Y., a 73-unit development, around a
golf course, where the homes sell for $2.5 million and up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upper end of the market is so strong right now, I wanted
to make sure I had some property to build on,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   When Christa Hyde, a division president with Liz Claiborne, and
her husband, David, whose company rents and sets up lighting
equipment for television commercials, wanted to move from Rockland
to Westchester County, they wanted a large home in a good school
district.
</P>
<P>
   The couple started out looking at houses in the $600,000 to
$700,000 price range, Ms. Hyde said, ``but we realized we'd have to
go up to the $750,000 to $900,000 range in order to get what we
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   They wound up buying the four-year-old model house at
Hardscrabble Lake. ``It was exactly what we wanted if we were to
build a house ourselves,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Paulsen, a sales agent with Holmes &AMP; Kennedy's Chappaqua
office, which handled the sale for the Hydes, said she had
encountered many buyers who start out at one price range, then go
beyond it to get what they want. ``People today want bigger homes
than their parents had, with a lot of bedrooms,'' she said.
``Sometimes I think a house is overpriced, and then it goes for
more than the asking price.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even the summer doldrums haven't placed a pall over sales,
according to Barbie Haynes, a sales associate for Merritt
Associates in Rye. ``I've been incredibly busy this summer,'' Ms.
Haynes said. ``Usually after Christmas you feel the propeller
starting and it catches that first crest. Then it dies down again
after spring. But it's been nonstop since the beginning of June.''
</P>
<P>
   According to real estate brokers, the only thing that slows the
market down is the lack of inventory. At the end of the second
quarter, the inventory of detached houses dropped 28 percent to
3,912 units, a level not seen since the mid-80s, according to the
Board of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been expecting to get a lot more inventory, but it
hasn't happened,'' Ms. Paulsen said. ``If I had the houses, I know
I could sell them.''

SAFEGUARDING AGAINST YEAR 2000 PROBLEM IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now most people are probably aware of the term ``millennium
bug'' _ meaning that because of the way dates were represented in
early computer programs, some computers may collapse at the start
of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There have been predictions of potential technological problems
ranging from worldwide banking and securities disasters to
elevators that go up but refuse to come down. And while no one can
accurately predict what will happen, some computer-knowledgeable
real estate experts say that those responsible for multiunit
buildings _ apartment houses, co-ops and condominiums _ should take
basic action now to avoid the need for more drastic remedies later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, every building has to have a plan,'' said Peter
Goodman, a New York real estate lawyer specializing in keeping
co-op and condominium clients ahead of the year 2000 problem, also
known as Y2K. ``Every building needs to conduct a comprehensive
audit of all date-sensitive functions.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Goodman said, the problem needs to be addressed
by co-op and condominium boards both internally and externally _
they need to scrutinize internal building systems and systems used
by outside companies and vendors that provide essential services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elevator problem is only one of many issues,'' he said,
referring to one of the more frequently cited problems that could
occur at midnight at the beginning of 2000: Some computer-guided
elevators could simply stop in their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also have problems with security systems, fire alarms,
smoke alarms, thermostats and even heating, ventilation and
air-conditioning equipment,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter de Jager, a Canadian computer consultant who was one of
the first experts to call attention to the year 2000 problem,
described its cause in 1993 in an article in Computer World
magazine. He wrote that when computer programmers were parsimonious
about how much storage space their programs used, they allocated
only two digits rather than four to represent the year. The year
``1993'' became ``93,'' and any calculations involving the date
would use that number.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, de Jager wrote, if a computer was asked to
calculate the age of someone born in 1955, the computer would
simply subtract the 55 in the birth date from the last two digits
of the current year. That works until the year 2000. In 2000, using
the same formula would make the person minus 55 years old.
</P>
<P>
   As whimsical as that may seem, de Jager said, it is a real
problem for a computer, which, if confused enough, promptly
crashes. ``The crisis is very real and potentially very costly,''
de Jager wrote in his article. And while there are others whose
assessments of the problem range from dubious to dire, de Jager,
who testified before Congress in 1996, remains one of the more
respected consultants on the year 2000 problem. His Web site, the
Year 2000 Information Center (www.year2000.com), recorded 558,894
hits last month alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the year 2000 problem, perhaps the largest part, is
that we don't know in advance what will fail,'' de Jager said
recently. ``So we have to fix everything that might break.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goodman said that in many buildings, security, fire-alarm and
power systems, and even backup electrical generators, are
controlled by computers. To assure the safety and security of
residents, he said, boards should contact the vendor who sold or
services the system to determine whether the system is year-2000
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   If it is not, he said, it should be made compliant if possible
and, if not, provisions should be made to do without the system in
the event it fails. The same, he said, would apply to any other
critical systems, such as heating or air-conditioning plants, that
rely on computer programs to function properly.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Goodman said, it is also possible that systems not
directly controlled by a computer running a software program could
be vulnerable to year 2000 problems. That is because some building
systems are made of mechanisms controlled by computer chips
directly embedded in their designs. A building-wide intercom or
telephone system, for example, may be susceptible to failure if
individual devices have built-in computer chips that rely, for one
reason or another, on an accurate time or date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke alarms, lighting systems and even thermostats in
individual apartments may have chips in them that could stop
working on Jan. 1, 2000,'' he said. ``Every board should appoint a
committee to go through every piece of equipment in the building
and take inventory of every system that could possibly be
affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Any potential problems identified, he said, should be rectified
as soon as possible. (A list of year 2000 problem consultants and
experts can be found at de Jager's Year 2000 Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said that buildings should make sure that their
suppliers, vendors and managing agents are correcting the problem
as well. Many heating-oil vendors, for example, use computer
programs to schedule deliveries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way to start checking would be to sit down with the
managing agent, look at each and every bill the co-op gets
throughout the year, and tick off each one after you have
ascertained that that vendor is or is not Y2K compliant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many managing agents themselves use computers to keep track of
the most sensitive and essential financial information, including
maintenance rolls, invoices received and payment records. ``You
might want to get a representation from them _ in writing, if
possible _ that their systems have all been checked,'' he said.
``Because there will no doubt be a lot of disputes that will arise
about systems that people thought were compliant but weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Errol Brett, another New York co-op lawyer, agreed. ``Nobody's
suggesting that this year 2000 thing is going to be all doom and
gloom,'' he said. ``But it can't hurt to have a computer expert
come in and talk to you.''

   WOLF CREEK, Mont. _ For the angler, the act of fly-fishing is
usually a celebration in and of itself. So it's doubly agreeable
when a cast of friends commemorates an event of greater
significance than your basic sick day by going fishing. A group of
us recently did this when our friends Greg Hubert and Julie Sanker
got married.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the wedding, which took place outside of
Cleveland, 18 of us convened on the banks of the Missouri River
near Helena, Mont. The Lewis and Clark expedition had also
assembled on these high and windy plains about a century ago. Of
course, Lewis and Clark did not arrive in cherry red rental cars,
as we did; they came on their own raft.
</P>
<P>
   Greg and Julie had rented the Wolf Creek lodge, a contemporary
log home that served as our base station for the trip. The lodge
sits high on a bluff high above the Missouri, overlooking a famous
stretch of water called the Bull Pit. Julie is an amenable soul _
you'd have to be to share your husband with a group of his lifetime
fishing buddies on a honeymoon in the Bull Pit.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri below the massive impoundment of Holter Lake is a
fabulous cold-water fishery, loaded with rainbow and brown trout
that rise freely to feed on the surface of this wide and
even-tempered river. But because of unusually heavy rains, the
river was running high and fast. The Missouri fishes best when the
flow rate is between 5,000 and 8,000 cubic feet a second. On the
day we arrived, the river was virtually impossible to wade.
</P>
<P>
   We had to content ourselves with sitting on the deck of the
lodge, reconnecting with friends and toasting Greg and Julie. It
was fine, but it wasn't fishing. The anglers among us cast covert,
longing glances at the drowned willows and flooded islands of the
Bull Pit. Fortunately, the flow rate diminished daily. By the third
evening of the trip, Chris von Strasser, Glyn Vincent and I decided
to venture into the watery braids of the Bull Pit. We found a
shallow bar to cross and slogged against the current, crossing a
small, flooded island. The next channel over was a permanent
feature of the Missouri, on the inside of a large island.
</P>
<P>
   To fish in it, we had to stand waist deep among the willows. One
of the sturdier branches held a bird's nest. If the water did not
drop quickly, the peeping chicks in the nest would not enjoy the
customary luxury of testing their wings. One crash landing on the
water and their downy wings would be too wet to get them back off
the surface. I wondered if their mother knew this.
</P>
<P>
   Glyn, who never saw a bend that he did not eventually go around,
disappeared downstream. Chris remained nearby and tied on a dry fly
of his own design, a caddis. It was meant to imitate the insects
that drifted on the dark water like tan husks of wheat. A few large
fish were rising in the channel, but none of them was working
steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Although I far prefer to fish the dry fly, the truth is that I
really wanted to catch a trout. And the high water conditions
dictated fishing below the surface with some type of wet fly. I
tied on a bead-head nymph, a size 12 Prince. I added a foot of
tippet material, securing it to the Prince at the bend of the hook.
I attached a smaller, olive bead-head caddis larvae imitation as
the point fly.
</P>
<P>
   The bead-head fly is a staple on western waters. It is
distinguished by a small gold or silver metal bead that resembles a
tiny gleaming cannonball, right up at the head of the fly. The
additional weight and sparkle added by the bead help to insure that
it gets down to where the trout live, and then catches their eye.
</P>
<P>
   The final element in my rig was a florescent, yellow-foam strike
indicator, about the size of a dime and folded onto the leader
about four feet above the Prince.
</P>
<P>
   When you fish this kind of rig, you just cast the whole works
upstream and allow the flies to drift naturally in the current,
watching the strike indicator for any twitch, blip or hesitation.
When it occurs, you strike. Occasionally, you find yourself fast to
a trout, rather than a drowned stick or clump of weed. I made only
a dozen or so casts before the strike indicator jerked and I hooked
a 16-inch rainbow trout. The reel screamed and I guess I did, too.
</P>
<P>
   The water continued to drop over the next few days and we
eventually had terrific fishing, mostly with dry flies. The Bull
Pit ultimately gave Greg a fine wedding present, a 22-inch rainbow
trout shaped like a football, only fatter. All that, and a bride
willing to spend her honeymoon in the Bull Pit. Lewis and Clark
were not the only ones to show undaunted courage on the banks of
the Missouri.

   The following are Atlanta Journal-Constitution stories for a
series on life in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-DOMINCAN _ SAN PEDRO DE MARCORIS, Dominican Republic _ In
the Dominican there is only one way to avoid a life of hard work
and poverty _ baseball. Young boys grow up playing with milk
cartons for gloves and dreaming about being the next Sammy Sosa or
Pedro Martinez. The most promising youngsters are signed at 16 or
17 and start working their way up beginning in the Dominican Summer
League. All 30 major league clubs have teams in the league. While
in camp, they are fed and housed in barracks. Bonuses and salaries
are very small, but much more than their fathers will ever earn.
Competition is fierce. Only two or three Braves players a year win
a spot for the next season in the U.S. Those that fail in the
minors are sent home in disgrace, a life of poverty almost assured.
(Wilkinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BBO-TALENT _ The search for baseball talent has gone

signed make the majors. (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   DDN-COX-CHIRO _ DAYTON _ From a nondescript clinic in tiny
Medway, Dr. David E. Polen has attracted a loyal following of
patients who say he's helped them when conventional medicine has
failed. But a Dayton Daily News examination of lawsuits, bankruptcy
records and a transcript of a deposition a cancer victim gave
before a regulatory board just before her death show Polen's
unconventional practices have also attracted the scrutiny of
regulators and brought complaints from patients and family members
alleging the Medway chiropractor exploited their trust. Polen
treated two other patients who delayed getting medical treatment
that may have extended or saved their lives, including a woman who
died of breast cancer in 1980. Her daughter, in a lawsuit filed a
year later, alleged that Polen told her mother the lump on her
breast was caused by infection and hookworm, and treated her for
seven months with poultices of buckwheat, flour, grated potatoes,
castor oil and vitamins. (Hundley/Hills, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   PBP-GAMBLE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ More than 200 years ago,
the framers of the Constitution cut a deal with the nation's
Indians that today may clear the way for 24-hour casinos featuring
booze, blackjack, lotteries, parimutuels and other games of chance
year round. It's a deal that has brought negotiations for tribal
casinos to the table and thrust the issue into courtrooms around
the state. Now, seven years after the Seminole Tribe of Florida
first asked to open full-blown casinos, maneuvering over the issue
is intensifying. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL _ If she were President Bill Clinton's lawyer, Susan
Brenner says she would advise him to tell the truth. Brenner, a
professor of law at the University of Dayton, doesn't say that in
an old-fashioned, all-American, cannot-tell-a-lie tone. She says it
because she feels the president is in grave danger of being hung
out to dry by Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, which could happen
if he lies and perjures himself. (Kline, Dayton Daily News). 15.

   BOWERSKKK _ Mississippi is preparing yet again to open old
wounds and air out dirty laundry - KKK leader Sam Bowers is going
on trial August 17 - for the fifth time - for the murder of Vernon
Dahmer Sr. A Hattiesburg civil rights activist who died in 1966
when he tried to protect his family from a band of about 16
klansmen torching his home. The Dahmer family has waited a long
time for this day; meanwhile, Bowers and his co-defendants are
cocky. Bowers has said he wants to get in court as soon as
possible. And Devours Nix, who was arrested and will stand trial
later this year, got out of jail by claiming he was too ill for it,
and then was caught teeing off at a golf course. Will the state
finally put these men in jail? (Rochell, Atlanta

<P>
   CLINTON-STAKES _ WASHINGTON _ His advisors are among the wisest
that money and prestige can secure. He commands the mightiest army
the world has ever known, and he's the undisputed and twice-elected
leader of the last remaining superpower. And yet, on the eve of
what history may well record as the defining moment of his complex
career, William Jefferson Clinton is a man largely on his own,
soberly pondering an excruciating political, legal and moral
calculus upon which may rest his presidency and his legacy. (Deans,
Cox News Service) WITH ILLUSTRATION. This story is part of an AJC

   ISLAM-WEDDING_ NABLUS, West Bank _ Standing before a soccer
stadium packed with about 15,000 people, 35 men stand in black
suits holding red Korans and the green Islamic flag. They are young
Palestinian grooms, expressing what for many is a new attachment to
Islam in a public wedding celebration that glorifies the religion
and, indirectly, Hamas. One Hamas spokesman calls the young
believers the ``raw material'' for his movement. For the second
year, Islamic groups in this large West Bank city are reviving
their faith with a strong dose of politics and by helping young
couples navigate the complexities of Islamic courtship. These
weddings keep men and women guests separated, offer no alcohol or
hedonistic music and they're catching on. (Kaplow, Cox News

   CLINTON-PRESIDENCY _ WASHINGTON _ The prolonged investigations
into President Clinton's personal life and his past financial
dealings have forever changed the presidency. Experts believe that
court decisions requiring the testimony of Secret Service agents
assigned to the president, as well as rulings stripping away
executive privilege from top presidential aides, will cause future
presidents to alter their conduct, making them unreasonably
cautious about everything they say or do while in the White House.
And forcing the commander-in-chief to testify in civil trials and
grand juries, as Clinton must do on Monday, could signal a future
in which presidents spend much of their time with lawyers prepping
to take part in court proceedings. (Shepard, Cox News Service).

have a very small but influential audience: a grand jury sitting in
a federal building not far away and seeing the president via video
feed (presumably encrypted to prevent intercept by some clever
video hacker). What, exactly, is this select group that will hear
Clinton's testimony, how will their questions be conveyed to the

   CLINTON-RECORD _ WASHINGTON _ Even if President Clinton did
something X-rated in private, goes the line spun out of the White
House, what counts is his public performance for the nation's
schools, families, economy and for its standing abroad. What
exactly has the Clinton administration accomplished, when measured
by its own goals? Certainly no president in memory, and probably
ever, has offered a higher stack of promises. With each campaign
and State of the Union address, Clinton has spread out scores of
new initiatives and proposals, from the minuscule to the expansive,
like so many hoagies and puff pastries on a vast smorgasbord. And
six years into his presidency, a few have been delivered, some have
been sent back to the kitchen by the Republican Congress, and many
others some seem a bit, well, moldy. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-REPORTERS _ WASHINGTON _ They slogged through Whitewater
despite a public that often preferred to hear less rather than more
about presidential scandal. They weathered the backlash of the
Clinton White House and sometimes faced resistance from fellow
reporters and their own publications. Now the handful of
journalists who have followed a trail of Clinton controversies for
six years are seeing their work lead to the first-ever appearance
by a president before a criminal grand jury. The persistence of
fewer than a dozen reporters has been largely responsible for
keeping the issue of Clinton's conduct before the country. ``The
heroes are the ones that have kept it alive,'' says Britt Hume, who
anchors an evening report on Washington for Fox Cable News. ``These
people have done tremendously well on this story, and it hasn't
been easy.'' Among them: Susan Schmidt of The Washington Post,
Newsweek's Mike Isikoff, Steve Labaton of The New York Times, Pete
Yost of the AP, as well as Jackie Judd and Chris Vlasto of ABC.

   US-ADULTERY _ WASHINGTON - Despite President Clinton's high

a huge majority of Americans still believe adultery is wrong,
according to polling data. And adultery among the average American
couple is far less common than the flurry of recent allegations
against Clinton and other public figures would suggest, say
sociologists, marriage counselors and clergy. But in cases of
divorce, adultery plays a much larger role. (Shepard, Cox News

TODD AND RANGERS WALLOP MEL AND YANKS, 16-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He didn't do it artistically or impressively, but he
did it in difficult circumstances, and his effort said enough about
him and his upbringing. Todd Stottlemyre, pitching for the first
time with his father in the other dugout, momentarily delayed the
Yankees' runaway spaceship Saturday and added to the record that he
and Mel Stottlemyre hold.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming a four-run first-inning deficit, the Texas Rangers
outslugged the Yankees, 16-5, stopped their latest winning streak
at nine games and prevented them from reaching the 90-victory mark
faster than any team in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers rescued Stottlemyre with a six-run flurry against
Hideki Irabu in the second inning, the last four scoring on a grand
slam by Rusty Greer. Mike Simms hit a three-run home run in the
eighth inning against Ramiro Mendoza that sealed the victory for
Stottlemyre, who allowed five runs while giving up nine hits and
walking six in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 283rd victory for the Stottlemyres, the most ever by
a father and son, who also are the only father (164) and son (119)
with 100 or more victories each.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, which left the Yankees with an 89-30 record, kept
them from eclipsing the 1944 St. Louis Cardinals (90-30) as the
team to reach 90 victories in the fewest games. The best the
Yankees can do is match the Cardinals with a victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This was one day in the Yankees' fantasy season when their
incredible record and methodical, relentless success could take a
back seat to a more personal day for the Stottlemyres. ``Two days
ago, I was nervous; now I'm anxious to see how he does,'' Mel
Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, said before the game. He
viewed his rooting interest with ambivalence. ``Blood is thick,''
the father acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   So thick that no sooner had the game started than the elder
Stottlemyre was sitting in the dugout ripped apart by mixed
feelings. Batting against Stottlemyre the son in the first inning,
the Yankees erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher might have escaped with one run had his middle
infielders performed more adroitly. Second baseman Luis Alicea
mishandled two grounders that were ruled singles, and another
grounder scooted under the glove of a diving Royce Clayton between
shortstop and second for a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch created trouble for Stottlemyre instantly,
lining a leadoff double to left field. He moved to third as Derek
Jeter grounded out, then scored on Paul O'Neill's grounder between
first and second. Alicea, moving toward first, momentarily got his
glove in the way of the ball, but it deflected into right field for
a hit.
</P>
<P>
   After Bernie Williams walked, Tino Martinez hit a grounder up
the middle. Alicea fielded it behind second and tried to toss the
ball to Clayton for a forceout. But Alicea made a poor throw, and
the Yankees had the bases loaded on another tainted single.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines then looped a soft single to left that produced the
second run and left the bases loaded. Jorge Posada was the next
batter, and he reverted to the ground attack, rapping a grounder
between short and second. Clayton dived for the ball, but it dipped
under his glove and into center field for two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, was discussing
his pitching coach's plight and said, ``Mel's temptation will be to
go out and talk to Todd if he gets into trouble.'' If ever there
was a time a pitcher could use a word or two of advice and comfort
from a pitching coach, this was it.
</P>
<P>
   But the father remained in the dugout, and the son, working
solo, induced Chad Curtis to ground into an inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates, happy to be only four runs down, proceeded to
give the 33-year-old right-hander more comfort than even his father
could have provided. They exploded against Irabu in the second
inning, with the final four runs of the six-run burst coming on
Greer's grand slam into the first row of the left field stands
behind the 318-foot mark next to the foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the inning, Irabu walked Todd Zeile and gave up
a single to Mike Simms. Clayton, the ninth hitter in one of the
league's most explosive lineups, then lined a double to right
field, driving in the Rangers' first run. Tom Goodwin followed with
a single to center, and the Rangers had two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stottlemyre in the previous inning, Irabu contributed to
his problems with a walk, this one to Alicea that loaded the bases.
Irabu then threw a first-pitch strike to Greer and a second pitch
that Greer lofted just barely behind the fence. Just like that,
Stottlemyre had a 6-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, working for his employer, not his son, did go
to the mound at that juncture, and his advice and comfort appeared
to work because Irabu retired the next two batters, ending the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, was only the signal for Todd Stottlemyre to
encounter more problems. With one out in the second, Knoblauch got
an infield single, went to second as Jeter singled and walked to
third as O'Neill walked.
</P>
<P>
   Williams then hit a fly ball to center field, but the Rangers'
defense helped Stottlemyre this time.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch scored on the sacrifice fly, but when Goodwin's throw
to the infield got away from Clayton, Jeter tried to score, too,
and Clayton threw him out as Ivan Rodriguez blocked the plate. The
double play ended the inning and prevented more trouble for
Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers rebuilt their lead to two runs with another run in
the third inning. Rodriguez singled, stole second one out later and
scored as Simms singled to left. The hit marked the end of Irabu's
performance, his briefest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez led off the Yankees' half of the third with a double to
left-center field, but Stottlemyre toughened, retired the next
three batters and allowed the Yankees no more runs in his
six-inning effort.

REAL ESTATE: FOR $40,000, AN APARTMENT GETS CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The walls, the kitchen cabinets and even the bedroom
floor were all the same color: a dull, grayish white. The doors to
the closets were hollow. A cheap bookcase rested against the wall
of the study. Moldings were used erratically in boxy,
architecturally undistinguished rooms. A too-large air-conditioner
dominated the top of one window, its ungainly cord stretched high
across a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Habitable, yes. Inspiring, no. But to Brian Tobin, who flew to
New York from Tokyo in March for a few days of apartment hunting,
it was ideal. He had lived in New York before, and he knew what he
liked. The duplex apartment on the Upper West Side was near Central
Park, and it had a potentially lovely garden where his two golden
retrievers, Rusty and Max, could spend their days while he was at
work.
</P>
<P>
   A trader of Japanese stocks for Salomon Smith Barney, he wasn't
afraid to make quick decisions. After a brief bidding war conducted
from Tokyo, he bought the apartment for $470,000 and immediately
called a contractor recommended by a friend.
</P>
<P>
   One month after he bought it, exactly on schedule, he moved into
the brownstone duplex at 24 W. 83rd St., now painted in a rich
palette of cantaloupe and green. It is a cozy and elegant place,
and not simply because of his cherry furniture and green leather
couches.
</P>
<P>
   Crown moldings circle the ceilings. Baseboards hide all wires
and give a neat finish where the wall meets the floor. Substantial
custom-made doors open into the guest room and the closet in the
living room. The walls are smooth and seem to glow, the result of
new plaster and an expert paint job.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation of the apartment cost him $40,000, no small sum
for a collection of seemingly minor details. But taken together,
they give a formerly undistinguished apartment character and clean
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else might have spent the same amount of money putting
in a new kitchen, or new bathrooms. He has kept them intact,
focusing instead on the myriad of small flaws that burdened the
apartment with its tacky, anonymous feel, like a place too often
rented, with no one putting a hand to it, making a mark, giving it
substance.
</P>
<P>
   For Tobin, 39, who has made eight international moves in the
last 16 years, the $40,000 was a magic and inviolable number. He
decided at the start that he could spend no more than that, because
he wanted to spend only 10 percent of the purchase price on both
renovating and decorating. He believes that is the amount he can
recapture if he has to sell soon. Any more he considers risky,
given his conviction that the real estate market has peaked.
</P>
<P>
   And from previous experience with renovations, he understood
that if he put a lot of money into, say, a gorgeous bathroom, it
would have looked out of place in an apartment with rickety doors
and ugly light fixtures, and he might never have recouped his
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin praises his contractor, Richard Baronio &AMP; Associates, for
doing the work on schedule and within budget. They, in turn, say
that Tobin was an unusual client, because he was decisive, acted
quickly and never changed his mind, saving both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Work began on the apartment one day after the May 7 closing. In
the living room, excess ceiling lights and sconces were removed.
Mirrored doors to the closet were replaced because, Tobin says,
they ``looked flimsy and cheap, like a hotel room you wouldn't stay
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The living room had a simple brick fireplace that seemed to
recede, almost to disappear. By adding a simple wood mantel
designed by Georgina Sanger, a design consultant for Baronio, he
gave it much more of a presence. The sloping ceiling was
replastered, to make it flat. A thin coat of plaster on the walls
helped provide a base so the paint would have a smooth, even
finish. Without that skim coat, Ms. Sanger says, walls ``look
mottled, with that eggy texture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The small guest room off the living room was given a new doorway
and doors, and it will be home to the television set, which Tobin
dislikes but considers a necessary evil. All the exposed wires were
buried in the walls, because he didn't want any of them visible.
The cord from the air-conditioner now plugs into a nearly invisible
socket, and new molding around a new, much smaller unit greatly
diminishes its presence.
</P>
<P>
   All the kitchen cabinets, and the front of the refrigerator,
were painted the same cantaloupe color that covers the walls of the
living room and dining area. It's a small kitchen, but efficiently
designed, and for a confident cook, like Tobin, who can carry on a
conversation and still manage to turn out three kinds of pasta for
a dinner party _ gnocchi with pesto, tortellini with cream and
mushrooms and penne arrabiata _ it is clearly adequate.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest draw may have been the garden, where Tobin cut the
ivy way back but otherwise did little. ``After the sun goes down
and the fireflies are out,'' he says, ``people say this isn't New
York. It's the Hamptons.''
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, the bedroom is painted in salmon, with white trim.
The white marble floor in the bedroom was covered with wool
wall-to-wall carpeting. ``I couldn't see myself waking up and
stepping on marble,'' Tobin says. A second and unnecessary entrance
into the apartment was closed off and turned into an extra closet,
for things like ironing boards.
</P>
<P>
   A small study off the bedroom has a built-in bookcase, created
at Ms. Sanger's suggestion from a freestanding unit that had been
left there, seemingly destined for the Dumpster. With a baseboard
on the bottom, molding on top and the sides filled in, it now looks
substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin wanted to do more _ wainscoting, for instance _ but the
budget wouldn't allow it. A previous experience in London, where he
bought a small two-bedroom apartment and gutted it, taught him some
lessons, he says. ``A four-week job turned into four months, and I
spent 30 percent more than I wanted to,'' he says. He installed
expensive wall-to-wall carpeting throughout, for instance, which he
now considers a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``In London, I thought I was going to stay for a long time,'' he
says. ``Now I'm more realistic. I could get transferred, or not
have a job.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he has learned that it is important to live in a place
for a while before making drastic changes, and to make do with what
you have. He would like, for instance, to remodel the bathroom,
putting in new tile and fixtures, but has decided that would be
unwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' he says, ``I spent $26 on a new shower curtain. And
it's not bad.''

REAL ESTATE: PROVIDING PLACES TO WORK, PLACES TO LIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Back in Trinidad, a half-century ago, Ortner Murray
``never dreamed'' that some day he might actually own property.
</P>
<P>
   The only real estate Murray knew anything about then were the
acres that he and his 11 brothers and sisters worked alongside
their father, a sharecropper, urging bananas, coconuts and corn
from earth belonging to an English landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of an innovative program called Storeworks that
tries to bolster the fortunes of less-than-affluent New York City
neighborhoods, Murray is about to double the size of his sportswear
business in Queens, and, to boot, become the landlord of several
rental apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say we were poor,'' Murray, now 60, said in
rose-tinted recollection of his boyhood days, working the fields
with a machete and living in a spare house by a rutted, rural road.
``We were happy with what we had, wearing worn shirts,'' he said.
``My mother kept us clean.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Murray and his son, Gerard, 31, ship 20,000 crisp
new T-shirts a year, as well as jeans, jackets, shorts and socks _
most emblazoned with their self-designed logo, ``School of Hard
Knocks'' _ to distributors as far-flung as Japan, Germany, England
and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, thanks to potent doses of support from New York City
and a not-for-profit group, the Murrays will expand their business
in a mixed-use commercial and residential building along an
increasingly bustling stretch of Northern Boulevard in Corona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is gold for me, owning properties back to back on this
boulevard here,'' Murray said. ``This is for my son, and he knows
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Murrays, owners of Von's Sportswear at 106-11 Northern
Blvd., will soon take over 106-13, the building next door, with
commercial space below and apartments above, that has been vacant
for 34 years. They, along with 30 other prospective property
buyers, are the first beneficiaries of Storeworks, a program
created by Neighborhood Housing Services, the not-for-profit group,
in partnership with the city's Department of Housing Preservation
and Development.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows small-business people and first-time home
buyers to take title to deserted, ramshackle buildings in
struggling neighborhoods by offering low purchase prices, favorable
mortgage rates and, in particular, a city subsidy covering the
difference between the purchase price and the cost of a complete
rehabilitation _ a ``gut rehab,'' in real-estate parlance.
</P>
<P>
   Storeworks, based on another, more extensive program called
Homeworks that is operated by the city and eight not-for-profit
groups, seeks to take advantage of the current real-estate boom in
many areas in hopes of seeing the opportunities filter out, even
into the poorest sections of the city.
</P>
<P>
   It is, to be sure, a small start _ with only 40 buildings in the
initial phase, 31 of which have been purchased by individuals, so
far _ while hundreds of abandoned, so-called ``in rem,'' buildings
are still held by the city after foreclosure because previous
owners failed to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But it comes at a time when signs of vitality are apparent in
once-desolate neighborhoods. Crime is down. Rents are up, evidence
of opportunity for some and _ with $700 to $900 for a two-bedroom
apartment no longer uncommon _ a harsh squeeze for others.
</P>
<P>
   Main thoroughfares are cleaner, though many side streets and
vacant lots remain littered and rubble-strewn. The bricked-up
buildings of the South Bronx, including those that not too long ago
bore cartoonish decals pretending to be real windows, are slowly
coming back on line.
</P>
<P>
   In East New York and Brownsville, Brooklyn _ still shadowed, of
course, by phalanxes of public-housing towers _ affordable-housing
groups are building new homes and private investors are renovating
old ones, so that whole blocks resonate with the clang and clatter
of construction.
</P>
<P>
   According to Department of Housing Preservation and Development
statistics, there are currently 2,232 buildings containing 19,084
apartments held in rem by the city. The department had no
breakdown, however, for how many of those buildings are of the
mixed-use type targeted by the Storeworks program.
</P>
<P>
   Storeworks, as it grows, said Richard Roberts, the commissioner
of Housing Preservation and Development, could be ``one of the
linchpins'' in the city's efforts to ``revitalize communities by
renovating properties and returning them to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``That creates,'' he said, ``a platform not only for the
properties themselves, but also for adjacent buildings. These
properties become a catalyst. When a city-owned building is
rehabbed, the adjacent owner feels an initiative to upgrade as
well, attracting other investment, and helping to create a real
environment for stability.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The underlying concept, said Francine Justa, executive director
of Neighborhood Housing Services, ``is to target an area with as
many resources, human and capital, as possible. And if it works
well, we'll do more of them across the city _ house by house, block
by block.''
</P>
<P>
   A key component of the strategy, Dr. Justa said, is a study
course for the fledgling landlords. ``It builds people's capacity
to help themselves,'' she said, ``kind of an insurance. If you go
to our home-maintenance training programs and learn how to install
dry wall, understand BX cable, learn carpentry and plumbing, it's
insurance for your investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Woodford has already had hands-on experience as a
landlord, and at 73, is about to give it another try. In fact,
Woodford has a variety of experience: merchant mariner, postal
worker, freight handler for the New York Central Railroad, taxi
owner and, currently, bus driver for special-education children.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the '70s that Woodford first became a landlord. ``I
had a couple of apartment houses, 16-family,'' he said, sitting in
his minibus outside the three-story building at 524 Sutter Ave. in
East New York that he is buying through Storeworks.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, workers carried debris from the now-cavernous
commercial space of the gutted building _ across from a weeded lot
and down the block from the storefront Roca de Salvacio Church _
leaving only bare beams and rafters eerily lit by a string of
bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did that for 15 years,'' Woodford said of being a landlord.
``Had enough trouble with tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   Then why try again? ``I'm 22 years older than my wife, Clara,''
he said. ``So I'm trying to create some income for when I'm gone.''
The Woodfords plan to open a laundromat in the commercial space on
Sutter Avenue. ``We love cleanliness,'' Woodford said. ``She
believes laundry should be done correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing that the neighborhood ``has come back a great deal,''
Woodford said, ``As people come in, they're going to have to get
their clothes cleaned.'' The Woodfords do not intend to live in the
building right away, ``but I intend to be around,'' he said. ``And
having experience, I know you've got to get good tenants.'' He
expects to charge $750 or $800 in rent for the two apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got into real estate they were practically giving these
buildings away _ $65,000 for a 16-family building,'' he said. The
purchase price for the Sutter Avenue building is $135,000, with a 5
percent down payment of $6,750 on a 7.875 percent, 30-year
fixed-rate mortgage. The gut rehab on the building, paid for by the
city, is costing $261,148.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city realizes that in the failure of these neighborhoods
is the failure to collect taxes,'' Woodford said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Robbins, project manager for Storeworks, said the city
sells the properties to Neighborhood Housing Services for $1 each.
It has, so far, allocated $4 million to rehabilitate the first 40
buildings _ 31 in Brooklyn, nine in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old procedure was to auction off abandoned properties, and
what you had was a bunch of starry-eyed entrepreneurs who thought
they could make a killing buying cheap and doing an inexpensive
rehab,'' Robbins said. ``What they encountered was buildings in far
worse shape than they imagined. So they couldn't rehab because they
didn't have the cash, and the banks wouldn't lend because the rehab
cost exceeded the property's market value. These guys would stop
paying taxes, and the city had to take the building back again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Storeworks program is designed to find buyers who have a
stake in the community, and it includes a mechanism to deter those
trying to turn a quick profit _ requiring those who do to pay off
substantial portions of the rehabilitation costs. And the program
favors buyers who will either live or set up businesses in their
building.
</P>
<P>
   Denise George and Phillip Ashby, soon to be neighbors, fit that
double bill. They will both live and work next door to each other _
she at 710, he at 712 Washington Avenue _ in two of three adjacent
buildings that Storeworks has acquired at the corner of a hopefully
appropriately named street, Prospect Place, in Prospect Heights,
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   As Robbins pointed out: ``The commercial strip is dense and
dynamic south of Prospect Place, and we hope to bring that vitality
to the other half of Washington Avenue. We're lucky we got three
buildings together, because people will see that a lot of money is
being invested here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. George, 30, an office manager with an architecture firm, is
paying $180,000 for a building with 800 square feet of commercial
space on the first floor, will live upstairs in one two-bedroom
apartment and rent the other for $700 or $800. She plans to open a
financial counseling business downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my first time in business for myself, and as a first-time
homeowner,'' she said, ``it's a huge step, a little scary, but also
a new-found opportunity.'' The rehab is costing $234,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, 29, a Fire Department paramedic, is also paying $180,000.
He, along with a cousin, plans to relocate their currently
home-based Internet business, New York City Web Corp. _ ``we
publish Web pages'' _ to the renovated ground floor, and move in
upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stepping stone that affords me the opportunity to have
a commercial storefront and to market the way companies my size
would, but without the overhead,'' Ashby said. ``I won't have to
deal with the exorbitant rent of a commercial space these days,
being that I own the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby estimated the market rate for the building at $380,000,
``and a commercial mortgage would be incredibly difficult because
you'd be putting down 25 percent up front.'' Under Storeworks, the
down payment is 3 percent, or $5,400, with the rate on the 30-year
mortgage at 7.875 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was in January 1997 that Robbins and other staff members at
Storeworks began ``windshield tours'' of neighborhoods, stopping to
knock on doors and talking to merchants, in search of the first 40
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   After advertising for potential buyers in daily and weekly
newspapers, the organization received about 500 applications.
``They had to be city residents to qualify, and they had to qualify
for a mortgage,'' Robbins said. ``We asked everyone to send in
documents, reams of paper, tax returns, bank statements, pay
stubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 initial applicants, about 125 completed the process
and were deemed qualified. And on Aug. 6, 1997, a lottery was held
to pick 40 finalists. Those 40 were then ranked according to
criteria established by the city, giving priority to residents of
the communities where the buildings were situated and,
particularly, to those who live or operate businesses in the
building. ``Of those, 31 have signed on the dotted line,'' Robbins
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two types of mortgages are available to would-be buyers.
</P>
<P>
   One is a Federal Housing Administration-insured loan offered
through the Bank of New York that is usually limited to residential
transactions. ``If you are a first-time home buyer and you intend
to occupy either the residential or the commercial space,'' Robbins
said, ``you can qualify for a 3 percent down payment. If you are
not a first-time home buyer but still intend to occupy the
property, the down payment is 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate for that 30-year loan is 7.875 percent, ``which is
phenomenal as far as commercial buildings are concerned,'' Robbins
said. Typically, commercial loans for the type of properties in the
program have 15-year terms at 9.5 percent, with 30 percent to 40
percent down, depending on the financial condition of the borrower.
</P>
<P>
   For an investor who will not occupy space in the building, the
same loan program requires 15 percent down and the same rate and
term.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Bank of New York loan is government-insured, it
carries rigorous underwriting standards and is document-intensive.
``Often we have people conducting small cash businesses who don't
show enough income to qualify,'' Robbins said. ``We didn't want to
exclude those people we felt would have the best use for the
property.''
</P>
<P>
   And so a second type of loan, not federally insured, was
arranged through Greenpoint Bank Community Development Corp. ``It's
a no-doc loan,'' Robbins said _ no documents. ``All they verify is
the availability of the down payment; they don't check income.''
For that loan, the term is 15 years, the rate is 9.375 percent and
the down payment 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage ``flipping'' _ buying and selling for a quick
profit _ the city places a non-interest-bearing second mortgage on
the property in the amount of the rehab cost. If the buyer sells
within three years, 100 percent of the profit goes to pay down that
second mortgage. If the property is sold between years four and 25,
the lesser of 50 percent of the profit or the balance of the second
mortgage is due to the city from the owner.
</P>
<P>
   As a compensating benefit, the city provides a real-estate tax
abatement. For the first 10 years, the building is taxed at its
pre-rehabbed assessed value. For years 11 through 20, the assessed
value increases by one-tenth of the difference between its
pre-rehab and post-rehab value. So at the end of 20 years, it will
be taxed at full value.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal read of these two subsidy mechanisms is that they
make the building more affordable to people with lower incomes,
because their annual expenses are reduced by the tax abatement,''
Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which sounded like a good deal to Michael Tate and his
family in Brownsville, Brooklyn _ his wife, Wanda; his father, Bill
Carr, and his three daughters, Asia, 17, Miasia, 9, and Nigeria, 4
_ all of whom pitch in to keep the family businesses going,
particularly when Tate is shoveling coal into the furnace at nearby
Public School 150.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shovels 400 tons of coal a season, and has the hands to
prove it,'' Carr said of his son. ``Just look at those hands.''
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, the family has operated Touch of Beauty, renting a
storefront at 107 Belmont St., where the sign says: ``Curls, Dry
Press, Neighborhood Florist, Funeral Designs, Balloons, Fruit
Baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   It started as a beauty salon, but over the years diversified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do everything,'' Mrs. Tate said, ``hair stylist, barber,
nail technician, body waxing, gift baskets, corsages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to Sarah J. Hale High School in downtown Brooklyn,'' said
Asia. ``In college, I'm going to learn chemistry so I can make my
own product _ stuff to strengthen the nails. Since I was 11, I was
passing rollers to mom, washing towels, being the gofer.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr, the grandfather, works with flowers. ``I do bleeding
hearts for funerals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The family had been renting the store for $700. ``The landlord
stopped paying taxes,'' Tate said. ``And when HPD took over, the
rent decreased to $500. But it was month-to-month; they wouldn't
give us a long-term lease.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, Mrs. Tate said, ``Peter Robbins paid a visit and
told us about the program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the lottery,'' Carr piped in.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification was about to become expansion.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the lottery, the Tates paid $125,000 for 107
Belmont, with a 3 percent down payment of $3,750. And last
November, in anticipation of the $216,643 rehabilitation, they
moved their business to a nearby store _ ``next to the
check-cashing place, which is booming,'' said Tate, ``near a
laundry, a cleaner, a bank, a bus stop.''
</P>
<P>
   So, come October, there will be two Touches of Beauty in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a double opportunity,'' Tate said. ``We come
from this neighborhood. We've seen it coming up. Now we see
ourselves going from nothing, a hole in the wall, to like the
establishment of a mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel victorious.''

BAERGA PERFORMING SOLIDLY, EVEN WHILE HE'S ON THIN ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Even though the Mets are in the midst of a wild-card
race, if Carlos Baerga feels a little unwanted right now, it is
more than understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Mets declined last winter to pick up the $4.5
million option for 1999 in the second baseman's contract, Baerga's
future after this season has been cloudy, to say the least. He has
heard the whispers for the last two years that he is no longer the
player he was in Cleveland in the mid-1990s. And Baerga, who turns
30 on Nov. 4, is well aware that the Mets discussed trading him to
Baltimore for Roberto Alomar earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But if it were up to Baerga, who is currently hitting .286 in
the final year of a deal that will pay him $4.67 million this
season, he would be back next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to stay,'' Baerga said here late Friday night,
after helping _ with his glove _ the Mets to a 3-2 decision over
the Arizona Diamondbacks. With the victory, the Mets kept pace,
one-half game behind the Chicago Cubs in the National League
wild-card race. ``That's my first priority,'' Baerga said. ``My
family likes it here. I really love this team. And I know we're
going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Mets feel the same way about Baerga is another
question. But while manager Bobby Valentine stressed that it is
general manager Steve Phillips' job to conduct any negotiations,
Valentine sounded as if he would not mind having Baerga back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Carlos is very valuable,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Valentine brought up three defensive plays that occurred
late in Friday's game, while the Mets were clinging to the one-run
lead. With two out and a man on first in the eighth, Baerga went
far to his left to field a tricky ground ball and throw out Karim
Garcia to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, after Turk Wendell walked the first two batters of
the inning to put the tying and winning runs on base, Valentine put
on a play called the fake wheel in a situation obviously calling
for the Diamondbacks to bunt. The play is designed to lure the base
runners and the hitter _ in this case, pinch-hitter Andy
Stankiewicz _ into the false belief that the defense is
aggressively defending against the bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Valentine said he will only put the play on when Rey
Ordonez and Baerga are in the field. ``I can make it work with
Carlos and Rey, because they sell it,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   They sold it not once, but twice. Even though Arizona manager
Buck Showalter cautioned Stankiewicz that the fake wheel might be
on, hitters are supposed to instinctively react to the wheel play
by pulling back their bats and swinging away. Which is exactly what
Stankiewicz did on two successive pitches. Stankiewicz fouled off
the first pitch, then grounded hard to Ordonez at short, who tagged
out the lead runner for the first out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Ordonez, who initially appeared to have a shot at an
inning-ending triple play, fumbled the exchange after tagging Jay
Bell out between second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Another pinch-hitter, Hanley Frias, responded to the fake wheel
by grounding right back to Ordonez. The shortstop flipped to
Baerga. With the game on the line, Baerga stood his ground at
second and turned the double play, making it look easy. The Mets
thus won for the fifth time in seven games on this road trip and
for the 17th time in their last 25 games over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos gets no credit for that, except from me,'' Valentine
said, referring to Baerga's defense. ``And I can't give him credit.
I can only give him appreciation. I know there are a lot of
opinions out there. But that double play in the ninth is what he
has done for us for two years. And he made that play going to his
left in the eighth even though people always question his range.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Baerga is doing about what he did last season, when
he hit .281 with 9 homers and 52 runs batted in. Actually, Baerga,
who has 5 homers and 46 runs batted in this season, is on a pace to
drive in more runs. And though it is easy to say Baerga is hitting
a soft .286, he is quick to point out that he has 24 doubles this
season, not far off his career high of 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means I'm hitting the ball hard,'' Baerga said. Still,
because he averaged 19 homers and 97 r.b.i. from 1992 to '95 (not
to mention a .315 batting average), Baerga's critics argue he is
not nearly the player he once was.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine isn't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos is hitting .290, and he's going to have 70 r.b.i. or
more,'' Valentine said. ``Whatever you expect from a second
baseman, he's going to have to give something to top what Carlos
can give us. Now, it's not my decision. And it's not the time for
Carlos to worry about it. But for me, he's as good a second baseman
as any I've ever had play for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mets watchers know Alomar is a free agent after this
season. Many believe he would like to join his brother, Sandy, in
Cleveland. However, in this scenario, Edgardo Alfonzo would be able
to shift from third to second, and the Mets could then make a run
at a power-hitting third baseman during the off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he can,'' Valentine said, when asked if he thought
Alfonzo could play second. ``I like Fonzie as a third baseman. I'd
probably like him as a second baseman, too. But I'm not going to
get into that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also psychological implications to a Baerga departure.
Alfonzo looks up to Baerga as something of a big brother _ another
intangible that Valentine points to when explaining why Baerga is
so valuable.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, Baerga is not exactly sure where he stands with
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Phillips, he doesn't really communicate a lot,'' Baerga
said. ``So we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   What Baerga does know is that he is not finished, even if others
don't believe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't feel that I could play anymore, I'm going to say
it,'' he said. ``I'm not going to embarrass myself. But I think,
for me, it's been a good year. We're having fun. We're winning. And
that's the key.'' &QL;

RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE: BOSTON'S SOUTH END 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Kimberlee Eveland and her husband, Andrew Lewis,
moved here from Washington five years ago, they looked for housing
in an environment that offered urban excitement yet seemed friendly
to families.
</P>
<P>
   They found what they were looking for in the South End, a
neighborhood filled with gracious Victorian houses, gardens, hidden
parks, bistros and a human melange of races, classes and
occupations.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they have ridden the wave of rising real estate
values. They were renters in the beginning, first in one apartment,
then in another. Then they bought a condominium apartment and,
finally, three months ago, they bought a 4,000-square-foot town
house, which they plan to renovate, decorate, and remain in as they
start a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it House 2000,'' said Ms. Eveland, because they
calculate that it will take about two years, and an investment of
an additional $200,000 over the $675,000 purchase price, to
complete the work.
</P>
<P>
   The progression of Ms. Eveland and Lewis from renters to the
longterm commitment of home ownership is characteristic of the
transition currently under way in the South End, a neighborhood
that has been accustomed to transition since the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow isthmus that linked the hinterlands to the City of
Boston was originally developed into a 500-acre haven for affluent
mercantile families. But by the turn of the 20th century it had
entered a long period of decline. Not until the late 1950s were
there the first stirrings of a turnaround. It burst ahead for a
while in the mid-'80s, subsided, and re-emerged with greater vigor
in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Now new homes _ from artists' lofts to luxury condominium
apartments _ are going up and a stream of renovations are under
way. In the wake of all this development, longtime residents and
workers, as well as newcomers, are buying in the neighborhood,
which is a few blocks from Back Bay's Copley Square and about a
mile west of the downtown financial and theater districts.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Russell, a 35-year-old fabric maker, is an example of the
transition. She rents an apartment in Jamaica Plain, a mixed-income
neighborhood about two miles to the west. For 12 years she has also
rented South End studio space in a Washington Street building
surrounded by a few dozen lofts that artists occupied when others
shunned such spaces. Next spring, Ms. Russell will purchase a
live/work loft in a building being built to provide low-cost space
for artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot of sweat equity into the South End and watched it
change from a red-light district with power shortages and bad
landlord behavior to a thriving artist-design community,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the oldtime residents and the newcomers worked to improve the
neighborhood, they also have seen values rise. The average sale
price for condominium apartments this year has been $334 a square
foot, an increase of 56 percent since 1993, said Deborah Taylor,
president of Link, a condominium listing and information service.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, according to Paul Rinkulis, a broker
with Keliher Real Estate, residential prices have hit historic
highs, with single-family row houses selling for $1 million or more
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, the South End is sought after for its
convenient location and as one of the city's few truly diverse
communities. There is a mix of races, and about a third of the
owners and renters have incomes in the low to moderate range, said
Rinkulis.
</P>
<P>
   Bustling South End streets reflect the mix. On one block is a
park for the local baseball league. Nearby, trendy new restaurants
and boutiques emerge monthly. While prices have risen, they are
still below those in Back Bay or Beacon Hill. As far as Ms. Eveland
is concerned, the South End, which with 3,000 period buildings is
among the nation's largest Victorian districts, ``holds together as
a neighborhood and it's an affordable opportunity to have a real
house in the city with a truly delightful garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ms. Eveland, 36, and Lewis, 42, are in the advertising
business, she as a freelance account manager and he as the
associate creative director of the firm of Mullen Advertising and
Public Relations. Their housing saga had the good fortune to be
well timed. In 1993 they sold a town house in DuPont Circle in
Washington, basically breaking even despite the relatively poor
housing market of the time.
</P>
<P>
   They had already moved into a furnished one-bedroom apartment in
the South End, planning to rent for at least as long as it took to
sell their Washington house. After the sale, they rented a
two-bedroom triplex for $1,800 a month _ ``an outrageous price,''
Ms. Eveland said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, as the Boston market was stabilizing from the punishing
decline of the early 1990s, the couple purchased a three-bedroom
condominium on the top floor of a town house, with a roof garden,
for $270,000.
</P>
<P>
   They invested about $55,000 in renovations, which they completed
last fall. But then they found their 4,000-square-foot
single-family town house. They sold their apartment for $455,000
and bought the house on West Newton Street for $675,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the right place at the right time,'' Ms. Eveland
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the number of condominium sales have
risen to 568 a year from 240 in 1993, while the average number of
days in which a property is on the market before it sells has
declined to 72 days from 117. The inventory of available
condominiums, which was 350 in 1993 and about 600 in 1990, is down
to 143, according to Ms. Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The South End has experienced wrenching changes since World War
II. In the early postwar period, about 1,000 Victorian houses were
demolished in urban renewal redevelopment that brought in new
housing, stores, a park and a rapid transit line.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in 1972 those blocks with the remaining 3,000 Victorian
houses became one of the first American neighborhoods to be placed
on the National Register of Historic Places. And in 1983 the
historic district became a Boston landmark district. Owners need
city permission to do exterior alterations that are visible from
the street.
</P>
<P>
   During those years artists and others helped restore existing
lower-priced housing, while the new stock of housing affordable to
low-to-moderate-income people expanded. Hundreds of apartments and
homes were built in two widely acclaimed developments, Tent City
and Villa Victoria. Last July, the Anna Bissonette House for the
homeless elderly opened on Washington Street. The $5.2 million
renovation and expansion of an 1869 warehouse created 61 apartments
with financing from federal, state and private sources.
</P>
<P>
   With housing demand now outstripping supply, developers are
expanding the borders of the South End. On the western edge, near
Roxbury, 65 condominiums, a mix of apartments and town houses, are
being developed in three projects. On the northern edge, abutting
Back Bay, a large new project is planned _ a $61 million complex of
105 condominium apartments, 66,000 square feet of retail space and
a $9 million improvement of the Boston Center for the Arts.
Construction should start next spring, according to the developer,
Druker Co. of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   New artists' residences are part of the mix also. Laconia
Associates, of Boston, has begun construction of a 99-unit loft
building for artists on land purchased from the city. About 45
units have sold for $90 a square foot, said John McLaughlin, the
developer, and 54 others have sold in the range of $140 to $200 a
square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Russell, the fabric maker, has agreed to buy a
1,500-square-foot live/work loft there for $155,000. ``I'm
enthusiastic about being part of the revival,'' she said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross and Peter Vallone, the
city council speaker, have each stockpiled more than $2 million as
they enter the final month before the Democratic gubernatorial
primary on Sept. 15, according to disclosure reports their
campaigns filed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The two have far more than their rivals, Charles Hynes, the
Brooklyn district attorney, and James Larocca, a former state
transportation commissioner. Hynes has $84,000, while Larocca has
$5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they can find a way to raise a lot of money very quickly,
Hynes and Larocca will almost certainly be unable to buy campaign
commercials in the days before the primary, ceding that front to
Ms. McCaughey Ross and Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   The coffers of all four Democrats are dwarfed by that of the
Republican incumbent, George Pataki, whose campaign reported last
month that it had more than $12 million. The Pataki campaign was
not required to file a disclosure statement Saturday because the
governor is not facing a primary challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross has $2.6 million in the bank, most of it
donated by her husband, Wilbur Ross Jr., a financier. She reported
raising $500,000 in the last month, largely from her and Ross'
personal funds. She spent $375,000 in that period.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who has $2.1 million in campaign funds, reported
raising $83,000 and spending $350,000 in the last month.

Monica Lewinsky. And like his client, Kendall, 54, has his
reputation on the line. Some Clinton loyalists are questioning
whether the tight-lipped, take-no-prisoners attitude favored by
Kendall's firm, Williams &AMP; Connolly, was the smartest approach in a
case that so obviously required a public relations offensive as
much as a legal solution. (Paul Hosefros/New York Times Photo)

AS RUMORS SWIRL ON OUTSIDE, CHAN KEEPS AIR CLEAR ON INSIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hello, plus a sincere thanks to a multitude of people who made
this move possible.
</P>
<P>
   With that, it's time to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   As training camp in Wichita Falls closed this weekend, the
Cowboys were a mere slashed neck and a thousand ``no comments''
away from saying a wonderful time was had by all.
</P>
<P>
   This is an organization where winning is no longer a sure
fix-all for credibility and image gaffes. Actually, winning is no
longer even a probability, which means credibility and image are
now in danger of being fed to the wolves or Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   So with due respect to Everett McIver _ it was, after all, his
neck _ there is a more significant wound the Cowboys, as an
organization, bring back from Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey was not bloodied in the McIver dorm-room incident,
but where being believable is concerned, he has at least been
bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey as the right choice to coach the Cowboys has yet to be
decided. Give it a season or two. But Gailey as the right kind of
human being to lead the Cowboys, that has been unanimously hailed
as Jerry Jones' shrewd or lucky move. Without ever having coached a
game in the NFL, Gailey made everyone _ players, fans and media _
feel good about an organization that has not been easy to like or
respect over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, unfortunately, there was Chan being sucked
right into another mess apparently created by the master of the
non-football-related mess, Michael himself.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the minicams, Gailey spent several days verbally
fumbling his way through repeated ``no comments.'' Watching Gailey,
there was certainly the thought of a cover-up, or worse, the
thought of a Jones puppet. Which could have meant there had been no
change from the previous overmatched Howdy Doody who answered to
``head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones can try, try, try to get on even terms with the truth _
and to his credit, he is trying. But as long as there is the
continuing perception that Jerry is running a protection racket for
Irvin and other team members in trouble, it's a hopeless cause.
</P>
<P>
   What Gailey's hire meant to Jones, however, was an alternative
to that perception. This was good for Jerry, good for the Cowboys,
good for everyone. But when the first major crisis arrived, well,
doubt about Chan surfaced, at least to a certain degree among some
media and some fans.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, however, there has been a third party much
more directly involved in how Gailey ``handled'' the McIver
slashing. If the players, who were also watching and waiting on
Gailey to react, are convinced a strong head coach emerged, then
what anyone else thinks doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   And, frankly, this is the good news attached to this stinko
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did \RGailey\S handle it right in the beginning, he's
still handling it right,'' said safety Darren Woodson. ``This is a
good man. I can't stress enough how he kept it from being a
distraction. There is not a dark cloud in this at all for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   One player, who asked that his name not be used, said Gailey
gathered a roomful of team leaders immediately after the slashing,
explained the entire matter, and then told them how he would
approach it with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it may have looked bad for him at times,'' said the
player, ``but he showed us not only that he was right on top of it,
but that he would be strong. This is not a cover-up, and he didn't
lie to anyone. It was simply handled within the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this,'' he said, ``there is no question in anyone's mind
who is running this team and who is in control. This was not easy,
and I know some people are doubting him a bit, particularly the
media. But within the team, Chan put it to rest quickly and
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Would a complete public disclosure of the truth have been
better? Yes, but that also depends on what happened in that dorm
room, and no media member knows, except that a neck was slashed.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, for his part, apologizes for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I came out of this viewed in a negative light, then being
human, I regret that,'' he said. ``Then again, it comes with the
territory. What I did was best for the team. The way I will always
handle things is what's best for the overall group. What I believe
in, and my values, those haven't changed. In making the decisions I
made about this, those values didn't have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Gailey who initially described the incident as
``horseplay,'' and even nationally, that has brought ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't regret that either,'' he said. ``My next sentence
was it could have resulted in a very serious accident. What I was
wanted to do was stress this was not a vendetta or simmering feud
between players. It was spur of the moment. If horseplay applies
again, I will use horseplay again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take very seriously this kind of wound for one of our
players. It's dangerous and it shouldn't have happened. But at the
same time there were a lot of other factors that went into it other
than that end result.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the locker room, doubts linger about Gailey's role.
Inside, however, he apparently never allowed a doubt to surface.

 &HT;    Kenyans wondering what position the U.S. has toward their
country
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nairobi, Kenya All David Ndira wanted was to help.
</P>
<P>
   Ndira, 32, an accountant who works in a building 200 yards from
the American Embassy in Nairobi, heard the explosion Aug. 7. He
came running at once, with rescue on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. marines, more worried about maintaining security than
about saving lives, would not allow him into the heavily damaged
embassy, Ndira said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were concerned with their stuff first,'' he said. ''They
were more concerned about the embassy than about the locals.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first of several actions taken by Americans since
the bombing nine days ago that have left some Kenyans wondering
whether Americans value the lives of Africans quite as much as they
value the lives of other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As people lay trapped in the rubble, some would-be rescuers were
driven off for fear they were looters. The dozen Americans who died
seem to some Kenyans to have been mourned more than were the more
than 200 Africans who died in the same explosion. And, said Ndira,
the terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy in Nairobi was ascribed
greater importance than the simultaneous bombing in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, because no Americans were killed in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ''That makes you feel like a second-class human being,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, in the view of some Kenyans, then added
insult to injury by advising Americans not to travel to Kenya, a
move the Kenya Tourist Board called ''a major threat to Kenya
tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials have shown that they are aware of the
resentments, and sensitive to them. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has said she will visit Kenya shortly. U.S. Ambassador to
Kenya Prudence Bushnell said Friday that the U.S. was giving Kenya
tools used in the rescue - helmets, saws, computers, generators and
a firefighting vehicle - as a gesture of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   And the State Department quickly withdrew its advisory against
traveling to Kenya, to the applause and relief of the Kenya Tourist
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, Kenyans seem stunned by the bombing, which blew a
whole in the city center and shattered windows for blocks around.
On Saturday, as they have for the nine days since the attack, they
gathered by the hundreds and even the thousands on the sidewalks
near the site of the explosion to gaze on the scene in silent awe
and bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Around the city, people continued to clean up. Merchants blocks
from the embassy swept shards of glass into giant piles and covered
their storefronts with plywood. Workmen atop a building 50 yards
from the embassy replaced roofing tiles ripped loose by the force
of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   A bulldozer rumbled through the debris behind the American
embassy. U.S. Marines inside stood guard at the bombed-out windows
with automatic weapons. Above the gutted building, the American
flag few at half mast.
</P>
<P>
   And outside, people piled wreaths, roses and carnations into a
memorial mound. A sign amid the flowers read, ''KENYANS WANT PEACE
NOT BOMBS.'' Another begged, ''GOD HEAL THE HEAVY HEARTS.''
</P>
<P>
   But even into quiet and moving tributes, other feelings intrude,
feelings of annoyance and perplexity at the actions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a resentment,'' said Sam Nyamweya, secretary general
of the Kenyan Football Association, after team members had laid
their flowers. ''They are thinking that the Americans are out for
the interests of the embassy and Americans rather than the
interests of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be overstating the case to say that Kenyans are angry
at the United States. ''Resentment'' is the word most frequently
used. People said the embassy should be rebuilt out of town, where
it would endanger fewer people. They said Bushnell should apologize
for Americans who thought rescuers were looters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they didn't sound angry. They sounded hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the resentment felt by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans are just victims,'' Kaboro said as he herded his
children from the scene of the attack. ''The ambassador herself was
also injured. American people got killed. Nothing against the
Americans.''

 &HT;    The Forest Keeper
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deep in the highlands of western North Carolina along a tumbling
creek is a forest primeval, a stand of giant trees that somehow
escaped the rape of the ancient groves that once mantled the
Southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   In a rugged corner of North Georgia and Tennessee, the Conasauga
River flows pristine and wild, home to more endangered fish and
mussel species than just about any other stream in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And up in the rumpled ridges of Tennessee not far from the
Virginia line is Slide Hollow, a 4,200-acre fragment of wild that
was cut almost a century ago but has slowly healed into a mature
hardwood ecosystem of rich biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   These three unique places within national forests of the
Southern Appalachians all were threatened with logging this year.
But in a signal that the U.S. Forest Service is changing its prime
mission from producing timber to protecting ecosystems, senior
officials pulled the plug on the logging proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping winds of change are buffeting the Forest Service, an
agency long accused of being cozy with the timber industry. The
director of the change is Chief Mike Dombeck, 49, a soft-spoken
Wisconsin native who was a science teacher and fishing guide in his
home state before joining the service. Unlike most of his
predecessors, he is not a forester, but a fisheries biologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to move out of the era where the primary focus was
timber harvesting and other things were secondary'' because society
no longer favors that course, Dombeck said in a recent interview in
Atlanta. ``We need to realize the land will produce water, it will
provide recreation and it will produce fiber, but timber should no
longer dominate.''
</P>
<P>
   With 187 million acres in 155 national forests, the Forest
Service manages more wild places than any public agency.
Increasingly an urban America hungry for outdoor recreation covets
these forests. From backpacking to mountain biking, fishing to
autumn leaf-looking, the national forests entertain three times
more visitors each year _ 341 million people in 1996 _ than the
National Parks system.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, national forests comprise 12.7 million acres in 13
states, embracing half the region's public lands and some of its
most endangered habitats. And nowhere could Dombeck's vision have
more impact than in the Southern Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   From the knobby ridges of northeastern Alabama to the majestic
Blue Ridge of central Virginia, eight forests totaling 4.5 million
acres are the largest block of public lands east of the Rocky
Mountains. Included in this mosaic of misty peaks and crystal
streams is North Georgia's 750,000-acre Chattahoochee National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are changing their management from an economic model to
an aesthetic and ecological model,'' says Warren Flick, a forest
economist at the University of Georgia. ``It's a profound change.
And to a large extent, it's a reflection of the growing wealth of
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have charged that letting private companies
cut timber on public lands has cost taxpayers millions of dollars
and amounts to a subsidy for the timber industry. A General
Accounting Office examination found the agency's timber sales
program cost taxpayers $245 million between 1992 and 1994 _ to mark
the trees, build the roads, replant trees afterward and otherwise
cover expenses not paid by the private companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service also has been chastised repeatedly in recent
years by federal courts for allowing the felling of trees critical
to fish and wildlife. To meet court mandates and growing public
environmental concerns, the Forest Service now allows only about
three to four billion board feet of timber to be taken by private
logging companies from national forests annually _ down from the
peak of 10 billion to 11 billion throughout the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate hauling out that timber over the decades the
Forest Service has built more than 380,000 miles of roads. Those
roads, say Dombeck and many scientists, have caused great harm to
aquatic species by producing smothering silt that oozes into
streams.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing such concerns has become the main mission for
Dombeck, who was appointed Forest Service chief by President
Clinton in January 1997. Dombeck has his sights on fundamentally
changing how the Forest Service operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the first chief we've ever seen that is really trying to
reform the Forest Service,'' says Andy Stahl, executive director of
Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics. ``Where he falls
short is, I don't think he understands how pernicious the timber
dollars are. All of the Forest Service financial incentives are to
log.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, when the Forest Service began to manage the
forests more like tree farms, a complex web of incentives to cut
timber has been spun by Congress and the Forest Service. It has
been a tangled web for the Forest Service, which was charged by
Congress with the often conflicting duties of providing a steady
stream of timber, while also protecting watersheds and wildlife and
providing recreation opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service managers still are rated by whether their
districts meet their timber quotas. Much of the timber money goes
back to the agency to pay overhead not only for timber but also for
wildlife and recreation programs. Twenty-five percent of timber
receipts are funneled directly to local counties with federal
forest land to subsidize roads and schools. In the process, the
service has grown into the largest agency in the Department of
Agriculture with a $3.3 billion budget and 30,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the board-foot is the driver or management, we're
going to have controversy,'' admits Dombeck. ``If you are a
district ranger or a forest supervisor, you ought to be rewarded
for trends and conditions on that landscape, which will include
water quality, land stability, forest health _ not just the board
feet you harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, members loyal to the timber industry have sought to
discredit Dombeck and have threatened to drastically cut his budget
if the agency does not get back to the business of producing more
timber.
</P>
<P>
   Dombeck also has detractors within the Forest Service, where
many foresters for decades have been conditioned to push
clearcutting. Although harvest reductions have triggered the loss
of thousands of jobs in the West, the industry by and large has
been able to adjust by turning to privately-owned timberlands.
According to the government, only 3 to 4 percent of America's wood
comes from federal lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 50 percent of all the softwood reserves, mostly material
for building, is on federal forests,'' says Henson Moore, president
of the American Forest and Paper Association, a leading industry
group. ``If you're never going to touch it, it means two things
will happen: We'll have to cut more off the private lands, and
import more. And neither one is good for our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, environmentalists are offering faint praise for
Dombeck. ``His rhetoric is impressive, but the real question is how
and when Dombeck will actively implant on-the-ground changes,''
observes Lark Hayes of the Southern Environmental Law Center, a
legal advocacy group that has fought a number of logging projects
in the Appalachians. ``The head and the feet are not together.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans to log sensitive areas like the Conasauga River, Slide
Hollow and the old-growth along North Carolina's Big Choga Creek
were pushed by Forest Service district rangers in spite of stiff
opposition from environmentalists, before being vetoed from above,
Hayes points out. But Dombeck did shift policy in January when he
tackled the forest road issue, proposing an 18-month moratorium on
all new road construction in ``roadless'' areas of national forests
in the lower 48 states. The moratorium was to give agency officials
time to draw up drastically new rules for road building ``based on
the best science.'' Dombeck says he will issue final rules in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposal does not rule out logging, the prohibition
on road building will significantly hamper tree cutting. Roadless
places are pristine enough to qualify for the federal wilderness
system but are not permanently protected from logging or road
construction. Environmental groups have argued for years that the
Forest Service should preserve these areas. On the ground in the
ranger districts where timber was not long ago king, some Forest
Service rangers who have long made decisions on when and where to
cut are frustrated with the abrupt change in direction. As recently
as January, Southern Regional Forester Elizabeth Estill wrote a
stinging memo to forest supervisors and rangers, threatening them
with poor performance reviews for failures to meet the timber
production goals the agency annually sets
</P>
<P>
   Estill says the memo was ``taken out of context'' and that she
merely wanted to impress upon them that ``we do what we say we are
going to do.'' Despite the memo, it appears that Dombeck's vision
is taking hold in the region. Estill has ordered no road building
or logging in more than 100 roadless areas totaling more than
500,000 acres in the Southern Appalachians, some of the largest
unprotected wildlands in the South.

 &HT;    To loggers, the forest is home
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barnardsville, N.C. _ When Ed Jones looks up at the mountains,
he doesn't see wild untouched land, as do so many backpackers who
climb North Carolina's emerald peaks. He sees the places where his
ancestors cut timber, farmed and lived in remote communities in
high valleys.
</P>
<P>
   A third-generation logger who at age 66 still puts in his day's
work in the woods, Jones is angered by what he now sees happening
to the national forests that include about 4.5 million acres in the
Southern Appalachians from the knobby ridges of northeastern
Alabama to the saddle-backed Blue Ridge of central Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Citing efforts to better protect and restore natural ecosystems,
in recent years the U.S. Forest Service has drastically reduced the
amount of trees it allows to be cut on its lands.
</P>
<P>
   But to Jones, these mountains are not a virgin preserve, but a
forest that for more than 100 years has produced timber to cut,
wildlife to hunt and herbs for medicine and food. And it could
produce more timber, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we're destroying the mountains when we cut timber,''
says Jones, a slight, nimble man who can still climb a steep trail
or saw logs with a massive 24-inch chain saw. ``Well, my
grandfather cut timber off these mountains and then sold the land
to the Forest Service for 50 cents an acre. And there is fine
timber there now. Cutting timber didn't destroy the mountains then
and it doesn't destroy them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and the company he operates with his son David,
Southwestern Logging of Sylva, typifies the small, family
operations that cut most of the mountain timber. The five-man crew
includes son-in-law Alfred Watson, cousin Keith Brooks and good
friend Gerald ``Possum'' Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small family operations are the backbone of the logging
industry in the mountains,'' says Jack Swanner, general manager of
T&AMP;S Hardwoods in Sylva, N.C. ``These are proud people. They want to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough, dangerous work. Jones' brother was killed more than
10 years ago when a log fell from a truck and smashed his head.
</P>
<P>
   Jones himself wears many scars. A stitch line across his left
hand shows where a surgeon reattached three fingers and a thumb
left dangling by a chainsaw; his left ankle is a prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be retired, but I can't stay out of the woods,'' he
says. ``I love it too much. If I quit, I would die.''
</P>
<P>
   And he and other loggers do it because the money is good. A
logger in these parts earns $100 a day, decent wages in an area
where workers commonly earn less than $300 a week.
</P>
<P>
   To native mountaineer loggers such as Jones, the debate over the
fate of public lands such as the 1.1-million acre Nantahala and
Pisgah national forests across western Carolina is a sign that they
are losing their mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want us to cut timber. They don't want us to hunt
bears. They don't want us to do nothing,'' argues Jones. ``Well,
when they cut out the logging and the hunting, what's going to be
left for us old mountain hoodlums?''
</P>
<P>
   As more and more people from the congested cities and suburbs
seek escape in the cool highlands _ either moving here or rafting
on the rivers, hiking the trails and camping in the forest _ the
Forest Service is responding to louder calls for preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changing demographics,'' observes Gary Pierson, the chief
planner for the Forest Service's Southern region. ``We're seeing
different values being put on the resources. What people want is
changing.'' The national forests of the East were created after
1911 when Congress authorized the Forest Service to purchase
cutover lands and old farms. Then in the 1960s, prompted by
Congress to increase timber production throughout all of America's
national forests, the Forest Service aggressively adopted
industrial forestry methods to increase production to fuel the
housing boom.
</P>
<P>
   Massive clear-cuts, some 200 acres or more, scarred the
mountainsides, where loggers like Jones had traditionally used
selection-cutting where the bigger trees were thinned, leaving the
rest to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to tell the Forest Service that clear-cutting was
bad,'' Jones recalls. ``But they did it anyway. It has turned the
public against us.''
</P>
<P>
   While national forest land in the South produces less than 2
percent of all the timber cut in the region, the Forest Service has
a much stronger presence in the Appalachians. In the highlands 17
percent of the timberlands are in national forests. Despite a
reduction of about 50 percent of harvesting from Appalachian
national forest over the past decade, timber industry employment
has grown slightly, according to the Southern Appalachian
Assessment, a landmark 1997 government inventory of the region's
public and private forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time the timber industry has claimed the sky
would fall on the loggers if harvest levels dropped on national
forests,'' says Peter Kirby, southeast regional director for the
Wilderness Society. ``But what has happened is they have shifted to
private lands, and that has more than made up the difference.''
Considered among the most valuable hardwoods in the nation, a lot
of Appalachian oak, maple, cherry and ash is exported to Europe and
made into fine furniture, musical instruments and even billiards
tables, says Ray Harbin, a veteran lumber exporter based in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, we're going to run out of private lands to log
because those lands are being converted to subdivisions,'' says
Swanner, whose mill in Sylva contracts with the Jones family to cut
the timber. ``Also, we're getting a new generation of landowners
who are not like the old farmers were. They are not interested in
managing their lands for timber. They just want to leave it
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   To just leave alone a mature hardwood forest seems like a sin at
worst, a waste at best, to the Jones family loggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like people who grow corn,'' explains son David
Jones, 37, who quit a job as a high school home-building instructor
several years ago to return to the woods with his dad. ``You can't
just let the weeds grow up with the corn. It ruins it. With a
forest it's the same way. We cut out some older trees to let in
light that allows the younger trees to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't cut them,'' he adds, ``they are just going to die
and rot and not be any good to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Jones never learned to read or write. He went to work in the
woods at age 15, using a team of oxen to drag the logs. He later
bought a used GMC truck to haul the logs to the mill.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when almost all the men, and some of the women,
who lived in the mountains around Franklin, N.C., where he grew up,
cut timber or sawmilled at one time or another. He shakes his head
when he talks about how bitter the argument over logging of the
mountains has become.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year at a Forest Service job along
recreation-popular Kimsey Creek, near the Appalachian Trail, the
Joneses were hit by vandals who poured dirt into the fuel tank of a
diesel-powered skidder. The result was a $4,000 engine rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen scattered vandalism of logging equipment in recent
years,'' says Terry Seyden, a spokesman for the Nantahala and
Pisgah national forest. ``And in the past year or two we've seen
more local protesters at logging sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the hazards, the controversy and the hard labor are worth it
to Jones. As he pauses to admire a full load of cherry logs stacked
high on his truck, he says, ``That sure is a pretty sight. A load
of good saw logs.''

 &HT;    Guardian angel of the wildlands
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toccoa , Ga._ Nowhere else in the Chattahoochee National Forest
is there a larger wealth of rare plants than in the foothills
between Toccoa and Cornelia. Perhaps no one knows the Gainesville
Ridges better than James Sullivan, 46, a self-taught botanist,
expert orienteerer, canoe builder and environmental activist.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the Stephens County resident has walked almost every
foot of this unique area where the Piedmont swells into waves of
low ridges at the base of the far grander Blue Ridge in northeast
Georgia. What he has found is a treasure trove of plants, from
massive beech trees in damp, cool woods to endangered purple cone
flowers along hot, dusty roads.
</P>
<P>
   It is a land also rich with timber. At times, Sullivan observes,
it seemed the U.S. Forest Service was bent on destroying the rare
natural ecosystems of the Gainesville Ridges by building more
roads, cutting hardwoods and replanting with pine tree plantations.
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan and people like him have helped nudge the federal
agency away from serving timber and toward protecting the
ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for us to protect large blocks of
wildlands, not just because they are reserves for species not
commonly found, but it's important to our mental health just
knowing they are there,'' argues Sullivan. ``I've had people tell
me, `I can't go through those places like you do. But I'm sure glad
they are there.'''
</P>
<P>
   To Sullivan and a growing chorus that means further reducing
logging of national forests. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s,
as environmentalists pushed for more protection of the high
mountains of Georgia, Sullivan documented that the government was
looking more and more to the Gainesville Ridges to make up timber
losses in the national forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be argued that this is the most endangered ecosystem
in Georgia, and yet the Forest Service has failed to recognize it
as a special place,'' Sullivan argues.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's activism has won the respect of one of the people he
was often most critical of, District Ranger Tom Hawks, who retired
early this year after 23 years as the head ranger of the Chattooga
Ranger District.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't just preach a party line like some paid person,''
Hawks says. ``He gets out there and studies the situation to learn
what is going on. He's very knowledgeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is one of the most senior members of Georgia
ForestWatch, which assigns members to monitor each district of the
Chattahoochee forest.
</P>
<P>
   ForestWatch was formed in 1986 as part of an agreement between
the Forest Service and a coalition of Georgia environmental groups
that had filed an administrative appeal of the Chattahoochee forest
plan as being too timber oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``ForestWatch and groups like them in other states have changed
the way the public interacts with the Forest Service,'' says Taylor
Barnhill, director of the Southern Appalachian Forest Coalition.

 &HT;    Lethal entertainment doesn't confuse nonviolent kids
 &HT;    By Damien Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bang! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not usually a violent person. But when
I saw this particularly violent TV show, I just had to kill
somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Does that make any sense to you? Me neither.
</P>
<P>
   Just because I saw a violent act on TV doesn't dictate that I go
and do it.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the fact that kids around the country have been going
to school and pulling rifles instead of rulers out of their book
bags is disturbing. I speak from experience, though, when I say,
``He didn't do it 'cause TV said it was OK.''
</P>
<P>
   I watch violent shows and movies, and I listen to music with
violent content, but I have never run out and committed violent
acts based on the lyrics or from watching ``Lethal Weapon 4,''
``Dark City,'' ``Fallen'' or ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, if some kid sees his favorite TV hero punching
some guy in the head, he's more likely to punch some kid on the
playground than if he had watched Mr. Rogers. That's one of the few
things on which studies agree. On the other hand, what kind of
environment is that kid living in that he doesn't know that the
things that may be seen on TV don't always translate into real
life?
</P>
<P>
   Some people might say, ``Well, you're just a kid, what do you
know?'' Fine. There are professors who can back me up.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University sociology professor Robert Agnew says studies
show that entertainment media violence is more likely to be
emulated when the violence is committed by the hero. That makes
sense; who wants to take after the loser?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the studies tend to suggest that exposure to violence,
especially on TV, has a small to moderate effect on kids,'' says
Agnew, who is director of violence studies at Emory. Perhaps, he
says, these studies showing that kids who watch violent programming
become violent might mean that kids who are violent like violent
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Media violence may contribute to a minimal increase of violence
in our society, but it's not the most important factor, says Agnew.
Some people, though, talk about TV violence as if it were, by and
large, the cause of the downfall of the civilized world.
</P>
<P>
   I'm 16. I have been in the Atlanta public schools and I have
seen violence. Nothing I've seen has ever gone as far off the
handle as TV shows. And there is the point. TV is used to inform
and entertain. The entertainment part should not be confused with
the information part. They are different animals.
</P>
<P>
   I have this shirt, my favorite shirt actually. It says, ``I do
what the voices in my head tell me.'' I love the reactions I get
when I wear this shirt. I've seen people cross the street after
looking at my shirt and seeing me lost in a Stephen King book. I
had a vendor at Six Flags Over Georgia ask me, ``You hear voices,
too?'' I don't know whether she was joking.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, the shirt is a joke. There are people out there
with schizophrenia who never harm a fly, but Hollywood always has
them burning down buildings. I'm poking fun at the sheer
preposterousness of that idea.
</P>
<P>
   Psychological predisposition is also a factor in kids who commit
violent acts. A person could just be messed up in the head. Every
day he could think about what he could do to the people who have
done him petty injustices.
</P>
<P>
   I think social status is a major factor in the level of violence
in a kid. If he is ``Mr. Popular,'' then he is a lot less likely to
get into fights than if he's the pariah, the outcast. He might be
watching violent entertainment to get ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He could try watching the news; it gives instruction _ detailed
descriptions about how murders were committed. This is by no means
saying that TV news should be censored, only that even the concept
of ``the public has a right to know'' has its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Don't just pick one thing to attack. Take your pick of the
hierarchy in the teen social system, the news, bad home training.
They're all to blame.
</P>
<P>
   I don't take Hollywood seriously; why should anyone else? Who
remembers the ``Jaws'' movies? Has anyone ever seen a great white
shark that big or vicious? For the most part, Hollywood distorts
stuff to the point where it can no longer be taken seriously. And
that, ladies and gentlemen, is entertainment.

FIXES GRAF, ``NO, I DON'T REGRET THAT...'' 
AS RUMORS SWIRL ON OUTSIDE, CHAN KEEPS AIR CLEAR ON INSIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hello, plus a sincere thanks to a multitude of people who made
this move possible.
</P>
<P>
   With that, it's time to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   As training camp in Wichita Falls closed this weekend, the
Cowboys were a mere slashed neck and a thousand ``no comments''
away from saying a wonderful time was had by all.
</P>
<P>
   This is an organization where winning is no longer a sure
fix-all for credibility and image gaffes. Actually, winning is no
longer even a probability, which means credibility and image are
now in danger of being fed to the wolves or Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   So with due respect to Everett McIver _ it was, after all, his
neck _ there is a more significant wound the Cowboys, as an
organization, bring back from Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey was not bloodied in the McIver dorm-room incident,
but where being believable is concerned, he has at least been
bruised.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey as the right choice to coach the Cowboys has yet to be
decided. Give it a season or two. But Gailey as the right kind of
human being to lead the Cowboys, that has been unanimously hailed
as Jerry Jones' shrewd or lucky move. Without ever having coached a
game in the NFL, Gailey made everyone _ players, fans and media _
feel good about an organization that has not been easy to like or
respect over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, unfortunately, there was Chan being sucked
right into another mess apparently created by the master of the
non-football-related mess, Michael himself.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the minicams, Gailey spent several days verbally
fumbling his way through repeated ``no comments.'' Watching Gailey,
there was certainly the thought of a cover-up, or worse, the
thought of a Jones puppet. Which could have meant there had been no
change from the previous overmatched Howdy Doody who answered to
``head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones can try, try, try to get on even terms with the truth _
and to his credit, he is trying. But as long as there is the
continuing perception that Jerry is running a protection racket for
Irvin and other team members in trouble, it's a hopeless cause.
</P>
<P>
   What Gailey's hire meant to Jones, however, was an alternative
to that perception. This was good for Jerry, good for the Cowboys,
good for everyone. But when the first major crisis arrived, well,
doubt about Chan surfaced, at least to a certain degree among some
media and some fans.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, however, there has been a third party much
more directly involved in how Gailey ``handled'' the McIver
slashing. If the players, who were also watching and waiting on
Gailey to react, are convinced a strong head coach emerged, then
what anyone else thinks doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   And, frankly, this is the good news attached to this stinko
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did \RGailey\S handle it right in the beginning, he's
still handling it right,'' said safety Darren Woodson. ``This is a
good man. I can't stress enough how he kept it from being a
distraction. There is not a dark cloud in this at all for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   One player, who asked that his name not be used, said Gailey
gathered a roomful of team leaders immediately after the slashing,
explained the entire matter, and then told them how he would
approach it with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it may have looked bad for him at times,'' said the
player, ``but he showed us not only that he was right on top of it,
but that he would be strong. This is not a cover-up, and he didn't
lie to anyone. It was simply handled within the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this,'' he said, ``there is no question in anyone's mind
who is running this team and who is in control. This was not easy,
and I know some people are doubting him a bit, particularly the
media. But within the team, Chan put it to rest quickly and
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Would a complete public disclosure of the truth have been
better? Yes, but that also depends on what happened in that dorm
room, and no media member knows, except that a neck was slashed.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, for his part, apologizes for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I came out of this viewed in a negative light, then being
human, I regret that,'' he said. ``Then again, it comes with the
territory. What I did was best for the team. The way I will always
handle things is what's best for the overall group. What I believe
in, and my values, those haven't changed. In making the decisions I
made about this, those values didn't have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Gailey who initially described the incident as
``horseplay,'' and even nationally, that has brought ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't regret that either,'' he said. ``My next sentence
was it could have resulted in a very serious accident. What I
wanted to do was stress this was not a vendetta or simmering feud
between players. It was spur of the moment. If horseplay applies
again, I will use horseplay again.

IRA SPLINTER GROUP BLAMED IN ULSTER BOMBING THAT KILLS 26

<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ A car bomb exploded Saturday in the
middle of the shopping district of this market town, killing at
least 26 people and injuring about 200 in what officials said was
the worst atrocity in Northern Ireland in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those killed and seriously injured unintentionally had
been moved closer to the bomb. Police said the bombers in a
telephone warning about 40 minutes before the explosion had given
them inaccurate information. Officials said they expected the death
toll to climb because of the seriousness of some injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the blast victims were women and children doing
back-to-school shopping. The blast occurred shortly before the
start of a carnival in the town center, which had attracted
hundreds of children. Among the dead were a pregnant woman and five
children, including a baby. Witnesses described a scene of carnage,
as the injured and dying lay moaning for help.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they suspect the bomb, estimated to have weighed 500
pounds, was the work of Irish republican dissidents who are
determined to wreck the peace process. Ulster Television received
two calls prior to the explosion from someone claiming to represent
the ``Real IRA,'' one of the dissident groups that broke from the
Irish Republican Army because of the IRA's declaration of a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing, which represents the greatest loss of life in
Northern Ireland during three decades of violence over British
rule, is the most serious blow to the newfound stability created by
the political settlement that was overwhelmingly approved in May by
voters, north and south.
</P>
<P>
   Republican dissidents have been trying for months to mount a
spectacular attack, although they have almost always given warnings
prior to bomb attacks, suggesting they had wanted to destroy
property and support for the peace process rather than kill
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the vague or inaccurate warning given by
the bombers was simply a failure of communication or was meant to
inflict the highest number of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the casualty figures were unusually high because
they had moved people to an area away from the town courthouse,
where a telephone caller had claimed the bomb was planted. The
blast occurred 400 yards from the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Flanagan, chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
speaking near the bombing site, said he believed the warning was
deliberately misleading to ensure a maximum number of casualties:
``Children with their mothers, shopping for school uniforms,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As Flanagan spoke, a uniformed officer stood next to him, his
lip trembling.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly, went to the local police station for a briefing. ``I saw
grown men, their uniforms covered with blood, crying,'' said
Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at Tyrone County Hospital said five people had
died at the hospital, which admitted a total of 108 people after
the bombing. More than 40 of the most seriously injured were
airlifted to hospitals in Belfast, Derry, and Enniskillen.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was on vacation in
France, was visibly shaken when he gave a televised interview last
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an appalling act of savagery and evil by people
detemined to wreck the peace process,'' said Blair. ``The bombers
will be pursued to the utmost in order to bring them to justice.
These people will never be allowed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertie Ahern, the Irish premier, called the bombing ``an attack
on democracy.'' He hinted at a crackdown on those suspected in the
bombing, a group that is allegedly led by a man who lives in the
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must ruthlessly suppress these people,'' said Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the White House condemned the bombing and said
President Clinton is determined to carry out his visit to Northern
Ireland the first week of September.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, the chief negotiator for Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, said he was ``appalled and disgusted'' by the
attack. He called on those continuing to carry out republican
violence to end it.
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, the Social Democratic and Labor Party leader who was
the chief architect of the Good Friday agreement, called the
bombers ``undiluted fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,
which opposed the political settlement, blamed the British
government for the bombing, saying its policy of ``appeasing
terrorists'' had emboldened the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mo Mowlam, the British secretary of state in Northern
Ireland, and David Trimble, the newly elected leader of the
Northern Ireland Assembly, broke off their vacations and were
heading back to Belfast. In a statement, Trimble said the bombing
would not have occurred if the IRA had turned in its weapons, as he
and his Ulster Unionist Party have urged.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the bombing was the result of a growing
determination by republican splinter groups to carry on the war
that many people here thought was over after the passage of the
referendums in May and the establishment in June of the first local
government in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   The group believed responsible for Saturday's bombing detonated
a car bomb in the center of Banbridge, a mostly Protestant town
just south of Belfast, on Aug. 1. But the area had been evacuated
and no one was injured. The warning in Banbridge came only 20
minutes before the explosion, but it was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan said Saturday's warning was ``totally inaccurate'' and
was tragically misleading. He said his officers were searching for
the bomb which the caller had said was ``near the courthouse.''
Police, meanwhile, had shepherded hundreds of shoppers about a
quarter-mile from the courthouse to the corner of Market Street and
Dublin Road. It was at that very corner that the maroon Vauxhall
sedan exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Banbridge and Portadown, towns with large Protestant
majorities that were targeted by dissidents in earlier attacks,
Omagh is a mixed town where Protestant unionists and Catholic
nationalists have relatively good relations.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours after the bombing, the usually quiet town had a
surreal feel to it, as car and building alarms activated by the
blast wailed, and British army helicopters hovered overhead.
Hysterical men and women looked for information on missing loved
ones, both at the scene and at Tyrone County Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Byrne, the newly elected assembly member for the area, said
he was at the blast site within 10 minutes of the explosion. He
said it was a scene of utter devastation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ran past me, bloodied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone County Hospital, a small provincial hospital, was
overwhelmed by the biggest disaster it has ever seen, a flood of
victims and loved ones looking for them. At one point, there was a
traffic jam outside the hospital as local people rushed to donate
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Among those hurt were teenage Spanish students who had come to
Ireland to study English and were visiting Omagh for the day. But
most of the dead and injured were local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is horrible, beyond words,'' said Byrne.

SPLINTER GROUP'S LEADER MAY BE SOUGHT IN INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ In an instant, Omagh joined the list
of towns in Northern Ireland that by their mere mention conjure
images of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   And in an instant, Mickey McKevitt became the most wanted man in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   McKevitt, reputedly the former quartermaster in charge of
weapons for the Irish Republican Army, is the alleged leader of the
``Real IRA,'' a splinter group based in the Irish Republic that is
being blamed for Saturday's bombing that killed dozens and injured
about 200.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Irish premier, Bertie Ahern, vowed to
``ruthlessly suppress'' those dissident republican groups that are
continuing violence.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean rounding up McKevitt, who is married to the
sister of the dead IRA icon Bobby Sands, and a group of about 100
hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Internment without trial was a disaster when it was tried
against the IRA in 1971 by the British Army. So many innocents were
caught in the dragnet that it merely alienated ordinary Catholics
and helped the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But there were suggestions last night that the Irish police, the
Garda Siochana, have a good idea who the leaders of the ``Real
IRA'' are, and that the atrocity in Omagh could trigger a roundup.
</P>
<P>
   Such a roundup, however, could give the dissidents an issue to
rally support. However, so widespread was the revulsion last night
that it was hard to imagine huge numbers of people feeling sorry
for McKevitt and anyone else who is detained because of Saturday's
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Omagh bombing marked the greatest loss of life in Northern
Ireland during the last 30 years of violence. The highest previous
toll in a single attack connected to the Troubles occurred in 1974,
when 28 people were killed in Dublin by a bomb planted by
Protestant extremists. A simultaneous bomb attack in Monaghan
killed five others.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the previous bombings targeted either Protestant
unionists or Catholic nationalists, Saturday's blast was noteworthy
for being indiscriminate in its killing. Omagh is a mixed town,
where the two communities generally get along.

STARR, CLINTON READY FOR MONDAY'S CONFRONTATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton sits down Monday in the
White House Map Room to deliver closed-circuit testimony to a grand
jury, perhaps one of the questions he will face is what has been
posed for months: Did he have a sexual relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   Before that general query is raised, lawyers from independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr's office are likely to ask the president a
series of narrow and highly specific questions designed to develop
a chronology of events, many of which were not asked in Clinton's
deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's strategy is to check parts of Clinton's story, and to
determine whether he is telling small lies that could expose bigger
ones, former federal prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is going to lie, it gets very complicated when you have
to give a great deal of specific answers,'' said a former federal
prosecutor, Joseph diGenova, who once questioned President Bush in
an independent counsel inquiry. ``You can get tripped up relatively
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged on July 31 to testify ``completely and
truthfully.'' Aides say that only the president, Hillary Clinton,
and personal advisers know what his testimony will be.
</P>
<P>
   After years of investigation into a variety of allegations,
after nearly seven months on the Lewinsky inquiry, this may be
Starr's last chance to prove his theory that Clinton has obstructed
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Starr is going in with plenty of
evidence in hand, or whether he is fishing for new clues from
Clinton that could prove the president's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that Starr will submit a report to Congress.
Ultimately, the report could lead to impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is not talking about his tactics. But the tenor of his
investigation is clear to those who have watched the parade of
witnesses file into the federal courthouse on Pennsylvania Avenue,
between the White House and the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has queried everyone from Linda R. Tripp, who taped 20
hours of conversations with Lewinsky, to several dozen Secret
Service agents who protect Clinton, to the president's closest
confidants. Lewinsky, who worked at the White House as an intern
from July 1995 to April 1996, visited the White House on 37
occasions after April 1996, most recently in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has been preparing for the session with his
personal lawyers, is expected to be pressed on his assertions that
he does not remember a private meeting with Lewinsky. If Starr has
evidence that Clinton met with Lewinsky privately on more than a
dozen occasions, as Lewinsky reportedly has testified, then Clinton
is likely to be asked to explain what he was doing on each day in
question.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Starr probably will outline a broad definition of
sexual relations, and probably will ask Clinton whether he had sex
with Lewinsky. That would determine whether Clinton lied in the
Jones sexual harassment case when he said he had no ``affair'' with
Lewinsky. Then Starr would try to build an obstruction-of-justice
case by questioning whether Clinton or his allies had urged
Lewinsky to lie about the alleged relationship.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is unusual, and not just because Clinton will be the
first president to testify before a grand jury. While prosecutors
routinely call witnesses before a grand jury, it is rare for the
target of an investigation to testify. Most defense lawyers advise
their clients to cite their Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination, and then refuse to testify. Clinton has agreed
to testify because his political advisers thought a refusal to
cooperate would look bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enormous risk and little practical benefit, because
by the time you are a target, the prosecutor believes you have
committed a crime, and it is highly unlikely your words can
convince him otherwise,'' said a former federal prosecutor, Robert
Ullmann of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unusual for a witness to have lawyers present for a
grand jury appearance. The White House announced on Friday that
Clinton will be accompanied by his personal attorneys, David E.
Kendall and Nicole Seligman, as well as the White House counsel,
Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest concern for Clinton is that Starr may have evidence
to corroborate Lewinsky's reported testimony that she had sexual
relations with the president. Clinton can only wonder what evidence
Starr may have, especially if tests have determined that Clinton's
DNA is on Lewinsky's dress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers may try to attack Lewinsky's credibility by
referring to reports that she contradicted her sworn denial of an
affair with Clinton after she received immunity from prosecution.
Kendall reportedly has spent much time collecting evidence that
could hurt Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials have insisted for months that they
would not attack Lewinsky, in contrast to their effort to undermine
the credibility of Jones and Kathleen Willey, a former White House
volunteer who said Clinton had made an unwanted sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides insist that Clinton will tell the truth about
his relationship with Lewinsky. But analysts noted that for years,
Clinton denied having an affair with Gennifer Flowers, then
admitted in January under oath that he had had sex with her on one
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said there is no contradiction
between Clinton's initial denial of an affair with Flowers and his
admission of one sexual encounter. That has prompted court
observers to wonder if Clinton will use a similar semantic tactic
in the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said Clinton's testimony could take several
paths. The president might insist that there was no affair and that
Lewinsky is lying. He might argue that his definition of sexual
relations does not include oral sex or other contact, if any, that
occurred between him and Lewinsky. He might say the details of a
personal relationship are private, while swearing that he never
told Lewinsky to lie. Or, he could issue a mea culpa and say that
his denials of a sexual relationship were intended to protect his
wife and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   One way to gauge what could occur during Clinton's testimony
might be to review what the president said when asked about
Lewinsky in his Jan. 17 deposition for the Jones lawsuit. The
transcript shows that Clinton often was vague and said he could not
remember.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton testified that it was ``possible'' that he
was alone with Lewinsky. ``I could have'' given her gifts, Clinton
also said. But asked if he had met with Lewinsky several times, he
replied, ``I don't know about several times.'' Asked if he had been
alone with Lewinsky, he said, ``I don't recall ... It seems to me
she brought things to me once or twice on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also was asked whether anything ``remarkable'' would
have occurred if he met with Lewinsky between midnight and 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, nothing remarkable,'' Clinton replied. ``I don't remember
it.'' No definition of a ``remarkable'' event was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   A former federal prosecutor, Bruce Yannett, said he expects
Starr to ask a series of questions that will leave Clinton with no
chance to reply vaguely to key questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would build up to the ultimate issues, including the
precise nature of the relationship between the president and Ms.
Lewinsky,'' Yannett said. ``It is very likely that Starr will ask
essentially the same kinds of questions that were asked of the
president during the Paula Jones deposition, with a greater level
of specificity and detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Yannett said Starr would focus on why Clinton gave gifts to
Lewinsky and why she returned them to Clinton's secretary, Betty
Currie. Starr will then try to determine whether Clinton urged
Lewinsky to lie about the relationship, which could be subornation
of perjury, or whether the two had simply agreed not to talk about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is also likely to probe into why and how Lewinsky received
help from Clinton's friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., and then-UN
Ambassador Bill Richardson, to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also will grill Clinton on whether he or his associates
had anything to do with the ``talking points,'' a document that
Lewinsky gave to Tripp in January. The talking points urged Tripp
to say she was unaware of Clinton making an alleged sexual advance
to Willey.
</P>
<P>
   While the vague nature of Clinton's responses in the Jones
deposition might make it difficult to pin down the president about
gifts and about Lewinsky visits to the White House, it will be much
trickier for Clinton to change his denial of having sexual
relations with Lewinsky. When Clinton gave his deposition in
January, Jones's lawyers gave Clinton a broad definition of what
would constitute sexual relations. Clinton was unequivocal with his
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,''
Clinton said in the deposition. ``I've never had an affair with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton testifies, Starr may recall Lewinsky or others
before the grand jury, and then he is expected to turn over a
report to the House of Representatives. The House then would decide
whether there is enough evidence to hold impeachment hearings,
thereby interjecting politics into the legal issue.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Lowell Democrat who sits on
the House Judiciary Committee that could hear the impeachment case,
said that a Clinton lie in the Jones deposition would not
necessarily result in impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be disappointed,'' Meehan, a former prosecutor, said of
such a revelation. ``But it doesn't rise to high crimes and
misdemeanors,'' the Constitution's definition of impeachable
offenses. But Meehan said it would be much more serious if Clinton
lies before the grand jury.

CONGRESS PREPARES FOR SPECIAL PROSECUTOR'S REPORT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is quietly preparing for the potential
tumult of having the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, drop
his investigation of President Clinton on its doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of Clinton's grand jury testimony tomorrow, Starr
is expected to report his findings in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter
to the House for possible action, including the most extreme
possibility: a push for the president's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   For many members of Congress, uncertainty is tinged with concern
about ramifications for the presidency, for their parties in the
November elections, and for their careers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's most partisan rivals sense danger. ``It's like
pulling the pin out of a hand grenade,'' said Representative John
A. Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the House Republican Conference.
``It may blow up on you.''
</P>
<P>
   No previous Congress has been confronted with a special
prosecutor's report on a criminal investigation of a president. And
there is little precedent for how Congress should fulfill its
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the nature of the case, with its allegations of a
sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky, strikes many
members of Congress as potentially more delicate than the Senate's
confirmation hearings on Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big mess, and I think Democrats and Republicans both
would like it to go away,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a
Lowell Democrat who serves on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said that the 36-member
Judiciary Committee will be responsible for reviewing Starr's
report, deciding whether hearings are warranted, and making a
recommendation to the House. The recommendations could range from
taking no action to seeking Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel law, which was enacted in 1978
after the Watergate scandal, Starr is required to ``advise the
House of Representatives of any substantial and credible
information ... that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr has said he will provide his findings to the House so it
can decide how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution grants the House the sole power to impeach a
president for ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' An impeachment is the rough equivalent of an
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   In case of House approval of articles of impeachment against a
president, the Senate would conduct a trial, presided over by the
chief justice of the Supreme Court. If the defendant is found
guilty by two-thirds of the Senate, the president is removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee has prepared for Starr's report by
hiring 14 lawyers and investigators, nine for the Republican
majority, five for the Democratic minority.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders also are holding regular strategy sessions. But
Representative Barney Frank of Newton, who participates in the
Democratic meetings, said the gatherings focus largely on how to
handle news media questions concerning the impending report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process is wide open because there is no precedent
for it,'' said Frank, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.
``But there is not much else to do until we see the report.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois
Republican, has said he hopes to curb leaks of Starr's report to
the news media by limiting the number of committee members who will
be permitted to see the material.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, committee members are weighing possible scenarios,
including the unlikely prospect that the panel will hold hearings
into the allegations involving Clinton and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties said they oppose holding hearings before
the November elections, for fear of a potential backlash from
voters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   However, many lawmakers are particularly skittish about holding
hearings any time. ``The reality is, if the whole thing comes down
to whether or not the president had consensual sex with Monica
Lewinsky and whether he lied about it, it would be difficult for a
lot of members to serve as judge and jury on that kind of matter,''
Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, members of both parties have urged Clinton to apologize
publicly as a way to resolve the matter without congressional
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Only a few lawmakers have expressed preliminary support for
possible impeachment hearings. Notable among them is Senator John
Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican and presidential aspirant, who
raised the possibility that Republican leaders would block
impeachment proceedings to prevent Vice President Al Gore from
getting a ``a jump-start on the next election.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in that,'' Ashcroft said last month on the
Senate floor. ``I believe that if there has been a serious
infraction that merits impeachment, the inquiry must take place.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton plans to testify before the grand jury via
closed-circuit television.
</P>

<P>
   In the meantime, the new lawyers and investigators on the
Judiciary Committee are reviewing the history of impeachments, even
though the history is brief.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Congress has brought impeachment charges against only one
president: Andrew Johnson, in 1868. Although the case stemmed
specifically from Johnson's dismissal of War Secretary Edwin M.
Stanton, historians said the impeachment effort reflected a much
larger struggle for power between Congress and the executive branch
after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In partisan proceedings, the House recommended Johnson's
impeachment. But Johnson prevailed in the Senate, as his foes fell
one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time Congress seriously considered impeaching a
president, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of
impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon in 1974. But as the
panel weighed additional charges, Nixon resigned rather than face a
likely trial in the Senate.

AS THE PACE HURTS CHIEF BEARHART, CETEWAYO ROLLS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Pace makes the race, and a slow pace
can ruin the race for a fast-closing horse. That's what happened
Saturday to Chief Bearhart, the 1997 turf champion, who ran fifth
while Cetewayo, with energy to spare, was winning the Sword Dancer
Invitational and outrunning the champion for the second race in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace did us in,'' said Jose Santos, who rides Chief
Bearhart. ``They were crawling on the front, and they kick in at
the end. Unfortunately, my horse didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Frostad, who trains Chief Bearhart for Canada's Sam-Son
Farm, put it this way: ``When you go that slow on the front,
everybody has a lot left for the end. The race was really a sprint
for the last half-mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Bearhart has now lost two straight races and three of his
last four, a reversal of fortune from last year, when he won five
of his seven races and finished second the other two times. When he
ran third behind Cetewayo in the Bowling Green Handicap at Belmont
Park last month, people said that the pace was too slow and
predicted that it would not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   But the die was cast earlier Saturday when Buck's Boy was
scratched from the Sword Dancer with a cough. He had been
considered the lone speed in the race, the horse who would force a
speedy pace and allow Chief Bearhart to unleash his finishing kick
with telling effect.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the lead was inherited by Val's Prince, who held it for
more than a mile. But he was crawling. He dawdled the first
quarter-mile in 26 seconds, half a mile in 52 3/5 seconds,
three-quarters in 1:18 2/5 and one mile in 1:43 1/5.
</P>
<P>
   Then everybody started to run fast, including Chief Bearhart,
who had been stalking the leaders from third place. But Cetewayo
had more speed left than the Chief, and he shot from fourth place
into the lead in the homestretch to win by three-quarters of a
length over Val's Prince, who took second by a neck over
Dushyantor.
</P>
<P>
   The winner ran the mile and a half on the grass under John
Velazquez in 2:29 2/5, which was six seconds slower than the track
record, and paid $10.20 for a $2 bet to win.
</P>
<P>
   He went home with $180,000, bringing his career earnings to
$350,000 _ not bad for a onetime $13,000 claimer.
</P>
<P>
   Cetewayo has soared into prominence with a success story of his
own. He won only one of five starts last year, but has won four of
five this year under his trainer, Michael Dickinson, and he scored
Saturday in a Grade I stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled him out,'' Velazquez said, ``and he exploded from the
eighth pole to the wire. Boy, he can kick.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   If you ever wondered why they called Saratoga the house of
racing upsets, consider Saturday's fifth race: Unbridled Express is
a 5-year-old gelded son of Unbridled who had run five times in his
career and never finished better than fourth. But in his sixth
start, he won Saturday at 69-1 and paid $140.50 for a $2 bet. He
also paid $61.50 to place and $13.40 to show and, with the 15-1
long shot Red Hawk finishing second, returned an exacta payoff of
$1,654. Jose Espinoza was the rider and Dominick Schettino the
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the horses in the barn can be Skip Away, but sometimes
they hit the jackpot, anyway. Sonny Hine's Spendable, who ran
eighth in his last start, reached for the stars in the seventh race
when he scored at 37-1. The payoff: $76 for a $2 bet to win.

MANY ABROAD ARE BAFFLED BY PURSUIT OF CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From Tokyo to Ottawa, from Moscow to Seoul,
governments have a question for Americans: Why does anyone care
about the former intern and the cocktail dress?
</P>
<P>
   Officials of friendly governments have warned that President
Clinton, Congress, and many Americans are allowing pressing
problems of war, terrorism, a renewed nuclear arms race, and
spreading economic contagion to be overshadowed by the Monica S.
Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   This is a strange time: The information that embassies in
Washington send to far-flung capitals often corroborates reports in
the most lurid tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   By now, most officials say they have heard _ and read _ more
than enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Russia, and Mexico, officials worry about plunging
currencies. In Ireland, they fear that Clinton will be distracted
or discredited a visit next month.
</P>
<P>
   And just across the northern border, when developments in the
White House scandal nudged up, with a nice bump for the Canadian
dollar, someone coined the term ``Lewinsky effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Canada are locked in a bitter row over
which country has the right to fish for the Pacific salmon, now
being heavily harvested by Alaskan fishermen. Canada wants the
president to intervene in the issue. In Ottawa, officials are
trying to entice someone _ anyone _ to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   With a political crisis looming, though, Clinton is unlikely to
offend powerful congressional leaders from Alaska and the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Across the southern border, Mexican officials talk about
tensions between Mexico City and Washington, including
disagreements over the guerrilla uprising in Chiapas, and the US
inquiry into Mexican banks.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists wonder whether the US president now has the
political capital to help with issues such as the plunging peso,
which fell to a record low against the dollar last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many institutionalized channels of communications
between our governments, but there are things that frequently
require the attention of the head of state,'' said a former top
aide to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, who asked not to be
named. ``It's hard to understand a country that gives so much
attention to something that would be so meaningless for many of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the privacy of presidential palaces and legislative chambers,
the officials alternate between bewildered shrugs and bitter asides
when discussing the eight-month scandal that has led to President
Clinton's grand jury testimony tomorrow. They say that America is
forgetting about the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American standards of morality were to be adopted in India,
most politicians here would be out of work,'' said Jairan Ramesh,
secretary of the powerful Congress Party in New Delhi. ``The longer
this festers, the more damaging it'll be for the president and ...
the moral loft of the office.''
</P>
<P>
   India, the world's largest democracy, is preoccupied with
tensions with Pakistan that led to nuclear tests and economic
sanctions imposed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Asia, politicians have overwhelming concerns of
their own, such as whether economic chaos will topple their
governments.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the United States' key ally and still the financial
engine of the region, policy makers say they are more interested in
how many yen the dollar will buy tomorrow than about what Clinton
will say in his closed-circuit television testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, long the bridge between Washington and Beijing,
the government was heartened by Clinton's recent trip to China. No
one relishes the thought of a White House tainted by a lingering
scandal. ``US-China relations are finally back on track, or at
least heading in the right direction,'' said a senior Hong Kong
government official who asked not to be named. ``It would be a
shame to see them stuck on the shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, officials' upbeat comments in public differed
sharply from remarks behind closed doors. In South Korea, for
example, Cho Tae Yong, head of the North America division at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the Clinton administration
has handled both foreign policy and controversies for years.
</P>
<P>
   But not far away, an official in another ministry mentioned
unease about ``the leadership problem.'' A fight between
Republicans and Democrats is expected to hurt efforts to persuade
the United States to lend billions of dollars to the International
Monetary Fund to help Asian countries in their economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Even the moralistic and conservative city-state of Singapore
seemed surprised at the dimensions to which this scandal has grown.
The Straits Times newspaper, which often echoes the government
view, editorialized that adultery is ``not a good idea, but
unfortunately, not uncommon. For that reason, one hardly expects it
to become the occasion of a constitutional crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, too, officials and outside advisers see in the
Lewinsky case a looming threat to US relations, which have depended
in recent years on Clinton's friendship with Yeltsin. Last month,
at Yeltsin's request, Clinton supported the $22.6 billion rescue
package Russia won from the International Monetary Fund and other
lenders.
</P>
<P>
   As the two countries prepare for a summit next month in Moscow,
officials worry that a US president enmeshed in domestic scandal
would be less likely to counterbalance the American Congress, which
many consider unfriendly toward Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could cause trouble for Russian-American relations, since
the main proponent of the positive approach to Russian-American
relations is the Clinton administration and not Congress,'' said
Vladimir Averchev, a pro-government member of the Foreign Relations
Committee in the lower house of Parliament, the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might be one of the
few allies who senses a reprieve as the American scandal continues.
Beleaguered at home, Clinton might not have the stature, or the
time, to force Israel to make concessions to Palestinians in peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government scoffs at such a notion. But Yaron
Ezrahi, a Hebrew University political scientist who has conducted
numerous studies of the American political system, put it this way:
``There is definitely a group of people here, especially the prime
minister and his party, who believe that they can benefit greatly
from Clinton's weakness, because a weak president will not be able
to empower the United States presence and role in the Arab-Israeli
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadians counted their good fortune when Lewinsky agreed to
testify against Clinton. Nothing against Clinton, mind you, but
Lewinsky's decision briefly rescued the tumbling Canadian dollar.
In the weird world of currency trading, the announcement made the
United States _ and the US dollar _ appear a bit less stable, while
Canadian currency suddenly seemed a slightly safer bet.
</P>
<P>
   It was short-lived: The Canadian dollar rallied by less than 1
percent, then dropped to a record low.

O'MEARA WON'T DISCOUNT COMEBACK FOR 3RD MAJOR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ If Mark O'Meara is to win his third major
championship this year on Sunday, he will need a brilliant comeback
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara shot a one-under-par 69 in the third round Saturday,
leaving him at two-under 208 in the PGA Championship and tied for
sixth place, five strokes off the lead. While O'Meara's situation
is not impossible, it will be extremely difficult to overtake so
many contenders with just 18 holes left.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Meara won both the Masters and the British Open in
comeback fashion, trailing in both tournaments by two strokes
heading into the final round. Drawing on the strength of those
experiences, and feeling that he is hitting the ball solidly,
O'Meara refused to concede after Saturday's round.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never complain after shooting a 69, but I know the
leaders are making some birdies, and that's what I'll have to do
tomorrow,'' said O'Meara, who is trying to become the first man
since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in the same year. ``I
don't think I'm out of the tournament by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do the fans in O'Meara's gallery, who shouted constant
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep saying things like, `Good things come in
threes,''' O'Meara said. ``I appreciate the support, and I'm trying
to feed off that. Hopefully, I won't let them down tomorrow.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Course Record
</P>
<P>
   Greg Kraft shot a course-record 65 Saturday and shot himself
into position to win a nice paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   In a round that included seven birdies and just two bogeys,
Kraft moved to one under par for the tournament and broke the
Sahalee Country Club record of 66, set by Tiger Woods on Thursday
and equaled by Vijay Singh on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With cooler temperatures, overnight rain and cloudy skies
combining to make the course softer and easier, Kraft took full
advantage, shooting a 34 on the front nine and a 31 on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft almost shot a 64, but he missed a five-foot birdie attempt
on No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day where everything seemed to go right,'' said
Kraft, a 34-year-old tour veteran who has enjoyed a solid year,
with two top-10 finishes. ``I made a lot of right decisions and
holed a lot of putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These greens are perfect. I think the whole golf course is
perfect. My expectations weren't for a 65. But I'm where I thought
I should have been at the beginning of the week, around par.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has bounced back after a subpar 1997, when he fell to
139th on the PGA Tour money list.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, I haven't been as sound as I am now,
and I haven't been as focused and dedicated as I am now,'' Kraft
said. ``I really didn't prepare for last year. I figured I was on
the right track and I just assumed some things. I kind of fell on
my face and realized that my mechanics weren't as good as I thought
they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this off season I worked out, started working with Robert
Baker who works with Ernie Els and Frank Nobilo. For the first time
in my life, I can see the results as I play and see it on video as
well.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Couples Rebounds
</P>
<P>
   After almost missing the cut, Fred Couples had his best round of
the tournament, shooting a 67 and moving to two over par. Couples,
who grew up in nearby Seattle, was five over par through two rounds
and finished Friday's second round right on the 145 cut line. But
he bounced back Saturday, cheered on by an enthusiastic gallery
that included many friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have made the cut,'' said Couples, who built
momentum by making a 30-foot birdie putt on No.3. ``When I finished
yesterday, I didn't think I had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were more people today than yesterday. I had a
big crowd, a lot of people cheering and yelling. I hit a lot of
great shots and felt like I earned a 67.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just in Time
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Kelly made it home in time to witness the birth of his
son, Cooper Patrick, who was born Saturday morning weighing 7
pounds 9 ounces. Kelly withdrew after Thursday's opening round when
his wife, Carol, went into labor in Hobe Sound, Fla. Both the baby
and Carol were doing fine.

GAILEY'S TEAM STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Cowboys broke training camp yesterday
still needing another pass rusher and somebody other than Michael
Irvin to catch passes on a consistent basis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet new coach Chan Gailey insists that his club has made
progress at Midwestern State University.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the headway perhaps requires looking beneath the
headlines of a telltale haircut. Offensive lineman Flozell Adams
looks like a 10-year starter. Running back Chris Warren is better
than the average backup. Omar Stoutmire has emerged at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have work to do, but I thought that things have gone
smoothly,'' Gailey said. ``We're ready to take the next step _
going back now to Valley Ranch and beginning our practices there,
getting ready for the opener.''
</P>
<P>
   Three more preseason games remain, including tomorrow night's
American Bowl against the New England Patriots in Mexico City. And
first-round draft choice Greg Ellis, for one, knows that the
Cowboys must begin showing considerably more productivity with the
pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look for sacks. I know that,'' said Ellis, whose
struggles at defensive end include no sacks. ``Nobody considers if
I'm making tackles, or holding down my side for the run. The only
time you are doing good is if you get two sacks. You may miss five
tackles in a game, but with two sacks a game you make the Pro Bowl.
Don't get me wrong. I want a sack. I can't say that I'm happy
without a sack. I want a sack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Mills wants a reception. But in two preseason games, he
has none. Billy Davis, who will start at the No. 2 wide receiver
spot against the Patriots, has but four receptions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Mills underscore the Cowboys' inconsistency on
offense. The Cowboys' first-teamers moved the ball adequately in
the preseason opener against Seattle. They were three plays and
out, however, on four possessions against the Oakland Raiders
before turning it around in the scrimmage against the New Orleans
Saints on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The up-and-down performance of the offense obviously concerns
Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense is at a point where it's the one that needs to
become cohesive, and the continuity needs to come together more
than /Rdefense, special teams/S,'' Gailey said. ``We've got to put
the whole thing together. We've had parts of /Rthe offense/S go
right from time to time, but we've got to have it all come
together.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman agrees with Gailey's assessment. But
Aikman said it might be too soon to predict the Cowboys'
regular-season effectiveness based on two preseason games. There
are, he said, still three games that don't count in which to get
this unit back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it is fair to try to judge us offensively
with where we are now to a year ago,'' Aikman said. ``This is a
whole new deal. Right now, I think we're performing at a level that
we'd hoped for. And we've still got time to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have answered some questions about depth at
offensive line, running back, and free safety _ where Stoutmire,
Kenny Wheaton, and George Teague give secondary coach Mike Zimmer
depth.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Adams struggled some at guard. But he is, Gailey
said, good enough to start at either guard or tackle in this
league. The acquisition of guard Everett McIver, the improved
strength of center Clay Shiver, and the conditioning of Nate Newton
gives Gailey hope that this unit will keep Aikman upright in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``One area that I think we've improved is pass protection,''
Gailey said. ``I think we've got a better idea about pass
protection and what we've got to do, excluding the couple of bad
missed assignments /Rin the Raiders preseason game/S that we've had
where the quarterbacks have been hit in the mouth from /Rpressure/S
up the middle. But I like how our offensive line has come along.''
</P>
<P>
   So have running backs Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren. In the
first preseason game and scrimmage, Warren showed the skills that
led him to more than 1,500 yards rushing in 1994. Smith showed why
he is the starter with a six-carry, 83-yard performance in the
scrimmage against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith isn't satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the running game is developing,'' he said. ``But we
still need to work on it. We've only had one good day and that
ain't nothing to brag about. We don't have much time. We've got to
get it together very quick.''
</P>
<P>
   And just three preseason games remain.

STRICKER AND SINGH IN A DUEL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Vijay Singh and Steve Stricker went back and
forth Saturday, like two boxers trading punches.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker snatched the lead from Singh on the front nine,
building a three-stroke lead. Singh responded with a brilliant back
nine, making birdies on Nos. 11, 13, 14 and 15 to take a one-stroke
lead over Stricker.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Stricker's turn. He made a birdie on No. 16 to tie
Singh, then saved par at the 18th with a spectacular recovery shot.
And when the Singh-Stricker duel had ended at Sahalee Country Club,
both players had separated themselves from the field and stood in
prime position to win the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at seven-under-par 203 after three rounds of the year's
final major, Stricker and Singh were four strokes ahead of their
closest pursuers heading into Sunday's final round. Davis Love III,
the defending champion, was one of three players tied for third
place at three under par, along with Steve Elkington, the 1995 PGA
champion, and Billy Mayfair, a two-time winner this year.
</P>
<P>
   With nine players at two under par or better, including Mark
O'Meara and Tiger Woods, neither Stricker nor Singh could start
writing a victory speech. But both leaders were impressive
Saturday, playing with the poise and confidence of golfers who had
been there before, even though neither Singh nor Stricker has ever
won a major.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker shot a four-under-par 66, including a 32 on the front
nine, while Singh shot a 67, including a 31 on the back nine. Can
Stricker and Singh play the final 18 holes as fluidly as they
played the first 54? Or will someone else emerge for an improbable
comeback victory? The answers will come Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Stricker sounded eager for the challenge. ``I hope I come
out like I did today,'' said Stricker, who was one of the tour's
best players in 1996, slumped badly in 1997 and then rebounded this
year with 10 top-10 finishes to date. ``I was real aggressive,
played really solid, hit a lot of fairways and greens. Hopefully
I'll have those some feelings tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting the day one stroke behind Singh, Stricker made an early
statement that he was a man in charge of his game, with birdies on
No. 2, No. 3 and No. 8, to surge to the front of the leader board.
Stricker split the fairways with pinpoint tee shots, avoiding the
trees and rough, putting himself in position for aggressive
approach shots and birdie opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker's early charge left everyone else behind except Singh,
who responded with eye-opening pressure shots of his own. On No.
13, Singh hit an 8-iron to 5 feet to set up a birdie opportunity,
and he hit close approach shots on No. 14 and No. 15 to set up
close birdie putts.
</P>
<P>
   But Stricker had the shot of the day on No.18, after hitting a
bad second shot into the deep right rough, under a group of trees.
Stricker, about 30 yards from the pin, recovered with a great shot
to within 8 feet, then made the putt to save par and retain a share
of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pressure circumstances, Stricker's chip shot was
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might have been the best shot I hit all day,'' he said.
``That just keeps me going into tomorrow with a positive thought. I
didn't hit that bad a 4-wood off the fairway, but I kind of
protected against hitting it left and pushed it right. But that
chip is something that will make dinner taste a little bit
better.''
</P>
<P>
   While the leaders left the course Saturday with great
expectations, others left with bitter memories. Several would-be
contenders shot themselves out of it Saturday, including Colin
Montgomerie, who started the day just one stroke off the lead but
shot a 77 to fall out of contention at four over par. At age 35,
Montgomerie will watch another year pass without winning his first
major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woods struggled to an even-par 70, once again having
trouble with his swing, leading to erratic shots off the tee. Woods
will need a memorable round to win.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is tied at two under par with O'Meara, who is trying to
become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors
in the same year, and two long-shot contenders _ Skip Kendall and
Frank Lickliter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long day for me,'' said Woods, who had just two
birdies and two bogeys. ``I made some good up-and-downs, and I'm
pleased to be even par for the day. It could have been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to knock down the putts tomorrow because I'm
putting well. I just need to hit some good shots.''

SPLINTER GROUP'S LEADER MAY BE SOUGHT IN INVESTIGATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ In an instant, Omagh joined the list
of towns in Northern Ireland that by their mere mention conjure
images of bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   And in an instant, Mickey McKevitt became the most wanted man in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   McKevitt, reputedly the former quartermaster in charge of
weapons for the Irish Republican Army, is the alleged leader of the
``Real IRA,'' a splinter group based in the Irish Republic that is
being blamed for Saturday's bombing that killed dozens and injured
about 200.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Irish premier, Bertie Ahern, vowed to
``ruthlessly suppress'' those dissident republican groups that are
continuing violence.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean rounding up McKevitt, who is married to the
sister of the dead IRA icon Bobby Sands, and a group of about 100
hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Internment without trial was a disaster when it was tried
against the IRA in 1971 by the British Army. So many innocents were
caught in the dragnet that it merely alienated ordinary Catholics
and helped the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   But there were suggestions last night that the Irish police, the
Garda Siochana, have a good idea who the leaders of the ``Real
IRA'' are, and that the atrocity in Omagh could trigger a roundup.
</P>
<P>
   Such a roundup, however, could give the dissidents an issue to
rally support. However, so widespread was the revulsion last night
that it was hard to imagine huge numbers of people feeling sorry
for McKevitt and anyone else who is detained because of Saturday's
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Omagh bombing marked the greatest loss of life in Northern
Ireland during the last 30 years of violence. The highest previous
toll in a single attack connected to the Troubles occurred in 1974,
when 28 people were killed in Dublin by a bomb planted by
Protestant extremists. A simultaneous bomb attack in Monaghan
killed five others.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the previous bombings targeted either Protestant
unionists or Catholic nationalists, Saturday's blast was noteworthy
for being indiscriminate in its killing. Omagh is a mixed town,
where the two communities generally get along.
</P>
<P>
   It also came on a day that town officials had organized a
carnival that was meant to foster better cross-community relations.
That is one of the reasons so many children were in the town
center, and why so many were victims.
</P>
<P>
   While the Real IRA and another splinter group, the Continuity
IRA, have tended to give warnings in the past, Saturday's vague
warning was blamed by police for killing and wounding so many.
</P>
<P>
   The Continuity IRA has been more active in the Tryone and
Fermanagh areas than the Real IRA, but Ulster Television said it
got two calls about the bomb prior to Saturday's explosion from
someone claiming to represent the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The previous high was in 1971, when 15 people were killed by a
bomb Protestant extremists put in a bomb in a Belfast bar. In 1972,
13 Catholic civil rights protestors were shot dead by British
troops in what became known as Bloody Sunday. And in 1987, 11
Protestants were killed by an IRA bomb in Enniskillen

COWBOYS BREAK CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys and the fans at
Midwestern State University ended training camp like they started _
with strong showings yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it was the final day, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
didn't let up on the players, taking them through a two-hour
practice. Considering the Cowboys play on Monday, Gailey said ``we
needed to get work some in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to them,'' Gailey said. ``All realized the road
\Rhome\S was just 15 or 20 minutes away. And to come out and have a
good practice was impressive on their part. It was a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Also a good sign was the attendance, as an astonishing 2,900
fans came out to say goodbye to the Cowboys. During practice, they
sang happy birthday to linebacker Fred Strickland, who turned 32
yesterday. They gave the entire team a standing ovation when
practice ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fans have been impressive from the beginning,'' Gailey
said.
Emmitt doubtful
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said yesterday that the team probably would hold running
back Emmitt Smith out of tomorrow night's American Bowl game
against the New England Patriots in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who sustained a thigh bruise in Tuesday's scrimmage
against the New Orleans Saints, has not missed practice. However,
Gailey said there was ``still some blood'' in his thigh, causing
the team to take a cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to take a chance with the thigh, unless he
makes a great recovery the next two days,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the team will make a final decision about Smith at
game time. However, it's unlikely the Cowboys will take a chance on
playing Smith because of the expected sloppy turf at Azteca
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The same holds true for backup running back Chris Warren, whom
the Cowboys list as questionable because of a groin injury. Gailey
said the team probably will start rookie Tarik Smith at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Fullbacks Nicky Sualua and Dwayne Chandler could also see time
at tailback against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Kavika Pittman, who is hampered by a sprained
ankle sustained against the Oakland Raiders on Aug. 8, will not
play against the Patriots.
Hellestrae's father dies
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys deep snapper Dale Hellestrae will not make the trip to
Mexico City because of the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple said Larry Hellestrae, who had
been in Wichita Falls visiting his son last week, died of a heart
attack Friday night in his hometown of Phoenix.
Chan's Corner
</P>
<P>
   ``''The work has been very good here. The facilities are really
good. We've answered a ton of questions, more about our 53-man
roster. But the mental aspect is everybody is ready to go back home
and sleep in their own bed. I would be one of those.'''' _Chan
Gailey Cowboys coach
Play of the day
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receivers Michael Irvin and Billy Davis have been making
spectacular plays every day throughout training camp. So, it's no
surprise that a catch was the highlight of the day on the final day
of camp.
</P>
<P>
   However, the key figure is a surprise. While Irvin and Davis
supplied their usual outstanding efforts _ especially Davis, who
burned cornerback Kevin Smith on an out-and-up route _ it was video
intern Jim Seeley who stole the show.
</P>
<P>
   Seeley was perched high above the goal posts shooting practice
when kicker Richie Cunningham launched a football directly at him
during field-goal drills. Seeley, never taking his eye from the
camera, stuck one hand out and effortlessly caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his heroic efforts, Seeley said, ``I had to make
sure I had the shot'' and ``I had to protect the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Seeley, interested in the job at No. 2 receiver?

COWBOYS QUESTIONS, ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Cowboys went into training camp with
several questions to be answered. Staff writer Kevin Lyons looks at
the key ones and provides some possible answers:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which young players emerged as future starters?
</P>
<P>
   A: Offensive lineman Flozell Adams and defensive tackle Michael
Myers will soon be starters in the NFL. Adams is 6-foot-7 and 335
pounds, but has the agility and quickness to play four positions on
the offensive line, although he'll probably make his mark at right
tackle. Myers started camp slowly, and he still doesn't stand out a
whole lot in practices. But he is always around the ball carrier or
the quarterback in practice and in games. He'll get to show what
he's made of as Leon Lett sits out the rest of the preseason with a
sprained left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is this year's non-drafted free agent with the best
chance to make the team?
</P>
<P>
   A: Herman Smith. The defensive end has been in three previous
training camps, with San Francisco last year, Tampa Bay from
1995-96, and Philadelphia in 1994. He has also played in the CFL
and NFL Europe. Right now, Smith, 27, is the Cowboys' oldest
defensive end. He has seen all of the first-team repetitions with
Kavika Pittman nursing a sprained ankle, and he has played at least
as well as Pittman. He's a lock to make the team, and no one should
be surprised if Smith makes a start or two this year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will Chan Gailey utilize Emmitt Smith and Chris Warren?
</P>
<P>
   A: To steal an old line from several of Gailey's news
conferences, ``Emmitt is the starter, and Chris will come in on
third downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What veteran starters benefited the most from training camp?
</P>
<P>
   A: Guard Nate Newton and middle linebacker Fred Strickland. Had
Newton, 37, not showed up in shape this summer, he could very well
be running second string behind Flozell Adams. Strickland, on the
other hand, began training camp in intense competition with Randall
Godfrey, who is a lot more athletic than Strickland. But the
season-ending injury to Broderick Thomas made the Cowboys change
their plans. Godfrey was moved back outside, where he started in
his first two seasons in the league, and Strickland will start in
the middle. Strickland has not really stood out this summer, but he
has also not made the kind of glaring mistakes that plagued his
game in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does Gailey have more control of this team than Barry Switzer
had?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes and no. Team owner Jerry Jones still has the final say-so
on a lot of matters. The way the club handled the Michael
Irvin-Everett McIver incident was a Jones production all the way.
But on the field, Gailey has complete control. Players who make
mental mistakes in practice must run laps after practice. And we're
not talking about rookie free agents here. Daryl Johnston, Troy
Aikman, Larry Allen and Michael Irvin are among the Cowboys'
superstars who've run laps after committing errors in a workout.
This is a far cry from the way Switzer ran practice, where Switzer
rarely dealt with insubordinate players.

ISRAEL CAN'T SEEM TO BREAK INJURY CYCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ He knows what people are thinking as he
pedals along, day after day, logging more miles on a bicycle than
Greg LeMond. He knows, but he cannot worry about it, because he has
something more important to worry about at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Israel knows it's time to worry about himself.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, when he suffered his first knee injury, Israel has
started in only four NFL games and played in only 37 of a possible
64. The reason is simple. His body deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened again last year after he left the 49ers to
rejoin Pete Carroll, who had been Israel's boss in San Francisco.
He brought his world-class speed and superior size (5 feet 11
inches, 194 pounds) to help the Patriots where they have been
hurting, seemingly for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   He was brought in to play right cornerback, but 13 months later,
he's still waiting for his body to give him that chance.
</P>
<P>
   After signing a million-dollar contract, Israel tore the patella
tendon in his left knee in training camp last year and was out all
summer. But as the pressure to perform mounted and more and more
questions were raised on his whereabouts, Israel decided to put
aside what his body was telling him and suit up last Sept. 14 after
missing the entire preseason and the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   He played that day against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play again for 11 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Israel played sparingly and always in pain, although
he did enough in the playoffs to convince Carroll that he could
safely trade starter Jimmy Hitchcock for a third-round draft choice
this spring. Carroll looked at that speed and size and still saw
the kind of corner he likes, a physical one who can play a receiver
at the line of scrimmage without fear.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, this corner hasn't been able to get back anywhere
near the line of scrimmage. He has been able to get back only on
the bike for what now must seem like an endless ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation is not new,'' Israel said. ``Everybody knows
what I can do with it and what I can't. We've all been educated to
it. It only makes sense for me to get in position to contribute
every week, not one week and then take three weeks off.''
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, he pedals on every day and goes to meetings
every night. He does not separate himself from the team, as some
injured players do. Steve Israel is still a Patriot. He's just the
wounded one.
</P>
<P>
   To some, what he has been doing seems easy. The skeptics mutter
that he gets paid for riding an exercise bike, something many
people have to pay to do at a health club. But it is not easy to
ride when you want to play, and it is harder still to watch a job
opening sit right there in front of you and believe you can fill
it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to hear about Beth Israel, the Boston hospital,
when your name comes up, and it's worse not to read your name at
all because that means you're in limbo, which has been Israel's
mailing address for longer than he cares to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he endures, somehow pedaling on, studying his playbook,
hoping that when his chance finally comes again, his body will not
again turn out to be Benedict Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this injury had just popped up, it would be different, but
I'm not in danger of trying to do again what I know I can't,''
Israel said. ``It's not fair to my teammates to go out and play a
week or two and then reinjure myself and be out again. You're
supposed to learn from your mistakes and your experiences in life,
whether they turn out great or not. I have.''
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, doctors went back into his knee and finally
found what he knew was there all along but nobody else seemed to
believe. They found a cause for his debilitation and, for some, a
cause for celebration. They found a problem, and that solved a
different problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy they found something and corrected it,''
Carroll said this summer. ``Steve was having a lot of problems and
no one could figure out why, so it was a relief to me for them to
go in there and find something and fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a relief because it was tangible evidence to the Patriots
that this was not simply about pain but about injury. In the NFL,
all players, at some point, are required to play with pain. They do
not, however, have to play with injury.
</P>
<P>
   Israel needed no such evidence then nor does he need it now,
when he knows more and more people are looking at him riding that
bike and shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   He knows how he feels and he knows how they feel, and this time
he'll go with what he knows best. He'll go with himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew something was wrong with it last year because it wasn't
healing, so it wasn't a relief to me,'' Israel said. ``I knew
something was wrong with my leg. I was just happy to get it taken
care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I come back, the decision has to be mutual. They don't
play, I do. If you tell the doctors you can play and they feel
you're sincere and not just a guy wanting to play when he's hurt,
they'll make that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be out, but I don't think about the
frustrating side of this because it leads to negative thoughts and
not smiling. I'm happy because I'm doing all I can and it's
healing. It's taking longer than I thought, but I know it's
healing. So I'm smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel was not smiling as he said those words last week. Rather,
he was asking why he needed to talk about not playing when ``a lot
of guys are doing a lot of good things. Why talk to me? I
understand you've got a job to do, but why talk to me?''
</P>
<P>
   The why is simpler than any of the other questions about him
that need to be answered. Carroll was counting on him this summer,
and so were his teammates and Patriot fans from Augusta to Acton.
He was counting on himself as well. But his knee is counting him
out, and so the people wonder why he is out so long and when he
will be back.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be in time for the Monday night opener in Denver, or
will second-year man Chris Canty be on that corner then? Will it be
in time enough to allow No. 1 draft choice Tebucky Jones to develop
slowly, the way the Giants got to allow Jason Seahorn to do? Or
will someone have to be rushed into the breach?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Israel can't answer those questions, but as he pedals mile
after mile, he surely has to be thinking about them. But he can't
think about them for long because if he does he knows he won't be
smiling anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he pedals on and prays his ride is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone with those prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, you may recall, Green Bay coach  &UR; Mike Holmgren
 &LR; garnered a lot of good publicity for giving up his weekly TV show
to spend more time with his family, demonstrating to his players
the kind of focus that was necessary to repeat as Super Bowl
champions. Well, it didn't help them repeat, so Holmgren will be
back on the air this fall. Holmgren was quite public about his
decision a year ago but mum about his turnaround this season ...
Speaking of Holmgren, it was learned last week that while he is
free to leave the Packers at the end of this season despite having
a contract for several more years as head coach, he won't be going
to the expansion Cleveland Browns, as many thought he might. That's
because the league's stocking plan for the Cleveland franchise
includes a prohibition against them trading draft choices to any
team as compensation for signing a head coach with a valid contract
... It's early, but the Cowboys have been particularly pleased with
the play of fifth-round draft choice  &UR; Darren Hambrick &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a
weak-side linebacker, and the discipline of new head coach  &UR; Chan
Gailey &LR; . Gailey, unlike predecessor  &UR; Barry Switzer &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is not a
laissez-faire kind of guy. Among his additions to the Cowboys has
been the shotgun formation and the penalty lap. The latter goes
into effect when a player commits a stupid penalty in practice. If
that had been in effect when Switzer was around, the Cowboys would
have had a half-dozen guys ready for the Boston Marathon. Of
course, all has not been smooth in this transition. The sliced neck
of free agent guard  &UR; Everett McIver  &LR; is a case in point. Rumors
have swirled for weeks that wide receiver  &UR; Michael Irvin  &LR; was
involved in the incident that left a gash in McIver's neck. Irvin
has never been charged with anything, but it has been reported that
he paid McIver a six-figure sum as hush money in a deal brokered by
owner  &UR; Jerry Jones &LR; . Jones has said nothing about the situation,
and players such as outspoken guard  &UR; Nate Newton  &LR; acknowledge that
they have been ordered by the team's public relations department to
refuse comment. All the Cowboys will say is that the incident was a
result of ``horseplay'' in the dorms. Perhaps, but only if you're
from The Godfather School of Negotiations. As for Irvin, he told
Dallas reporters recently, ``You guys are trying harder to put me
in jail than the police.'' The story believed to be the closest to
the truth is that this was a case of a haircut gone bad, a haircut
done by an amateur barber in the dorm suite of  &UR; Kavika Pittman  &LR; at
Cowboy training camp. Pittman claims he was not in the room when
McIver tried to defend the barber after an argument broke out. Last
Thursday, McIver spoke with representatives of the Dallas probation
department, which could send Irvin away for up to 20 years if it
revokes his probation that resulted from the bizarre case involving
strippers, drugs, and death threats a year ago ... Gailey recently
showed that he can be a diplomat. On a questionnaire given to all
new head coaches by the NFL, they are asked to name the most
knowledgeable football writer they've ever met. Gailey's reply?
``The one I'm talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   The Bears have finally had it with No. 1 draft choice  &UR; Curtis
Enis &LR; . Vice president for personnel  &UR; Ted Phillips  &LR; informed Enis's
agent,  &UR; Greg Feste &LR; , that the Penn State running back has until
noon Sunday to accept either a five-year deal with a $5.5 million
signing bonus or a six-year one with a slightly higher bonus.
Otherwise, no more than a three-year contract worth far less money
will be offered. The Bears fear that if Enis misses any more time
from training camp, he will be all but useless for much of his
rookie year. Enis claims he might sit out the season and reenter
the draft next year if Chicago doesn't do something to make it
easier for him to void the final three years of the present
six-year offer. If Enis doesn't sign by noon  &UR; today &LR; , he will have
voided out those three years _ and a lot of money _ himself ...
Steelers quarterback  &UR; Kordell Stewart  &LR; is threatening a
little-known NFL record. If he rushes for five touchdowns in this,
his fourth, NFL season, he will surpass former Patriot quarterback
 &UR; Steve Grogan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who rushed for 21 TDs in his first four years ...
Quarterback  &UR; Steve DeBerg &LR; , 44, &UR;  &LR; hadn't played in an NFL game since
1993, and it looked like it last week when he saw his first action
with Atlanta. Signed as insurance after  &UR; Mark Rypien  &LR; was forced to
retire because of family illnesses, DeBerg was sacked three times,
fumbled, and completed only 6 of 11 passes for only 39 yards ...
San Francisco quarterback  &UR; Steve Young  &LR; says he has seen many
changes in the game over the years, but none more than in
conditioning. ``I remember my first year guys were smoking in the
locker room,'' Young recalled. ``I was shocked. You'd never see
that today. If you did that today, guys would look at you like you
were insane.'' ... This will make  &UR; Tom Finneran  &LR; nod his head, I'm
sure. Out in Oakland, the cost of bailing out the Oakland Alameda
County Coliseum will grow to $21 million this year, up $5.4 million
from a year ago, according to estimates from the Alameda County
auditor's office. Nearly all of that red ink has resulted from the
deal cut to lure the Raiders back from Los Angeles. The bailout
money is to cover payments on $198 million in bonds that were
issued to finance renovating and operating the stadium to the
Raiders' satisfaction ... Conversely, things in Tampa have gone so
well with the construction of Raymond James Stadium that the
Buccaneers have added 89 suites to the original 75 because of
demand. The suites will sell for $70,000-$120,000 a year ... The
49ers paid a king's ransom to Green Bay free agent  &UR; Gabe Wilkins
 &LR; in hopes he would bolster their defensive line. But he will miss
at least the first month of the season because of continuing
problems with a torn knee ligament that had bothered him during
last year's Super Bowl ... New England running back  &UR; Robert Edwards
 &LR; isn't the only No. 1 draft pick limping. So, too, is Miami runner
 &UR; John Avery &LR; . After a fast start, Avery has been hobbled with a
strained hamstring, and head coach  &UR; Jimmy Johnson  &LR; is growing
impatient. Last week Johnson publicly chastised Avery, saying it
was time for people to win jobs.

CARROLL HAD CAMP FIRE BURNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ There is a swagger to him now that was
missing in his first year. Not to the point where he'd give someone
the ``choke'' sign, as he did to Miami kicker Pete Stoyanovich when
he was head coach of the New York Jets during a key 1995 AFC East
clash. That wasn't so much swagger as immaturity. But now there's
no denying that Pete Carroll, as former Red Sox manager Joe Morgan
might put it, is the skipper of this 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt on everything he
decided last year because I knew how difficult of a situation he
was getting himself into,'' said Patriots defensive back Ty Law.
``But now it's a year later. He knows his players, and his players
know him. We know how he wants things done, and now the
communication is better than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said he has spent a lot of time during training camp
with the receivers and defensive backs because ``those are highly
competitive areas and I've needed to pay attention to those to make
the best evaluation there and really see which guys are ahead of
some others.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the difference between this year's camp and last year's,
Carroll said, ``I was able to work with individual guys more this
year than I was last year. What I mean is, I was pushing them
along, communicating with them about things they were doing, trying
to keep them going, challenging guys on an individual basis.
Because I know them a little more, I also know what they need and
how they need to be treated to motivate them. That's been a much
bigger part of my participation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, as training camp ended Saturday at Bryant College,
Carroll still faced big issues, such as, who will be the starting
running back? Can the offensive line run-block effectively? Who
will start at right cornerback while Tebucky Jones learns the job?
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has three weeks to find the answers in time for the
season opener. His hope is that by then Robert Edwards will have
healed from his groin injury and won the running back job and
veteran Steve Israel will be back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing camp, Carroll said, ``I was pleased with everything
except the results of the last game (a 28-0 loss to Minnesota last
Sunday). The camp went well. It was taxing. We made it through
relatively healthy. We feel pretty good about where we are right
now. I'd like us to have a nice game Monday and show the progress I
think we've made.''
</P>
<P>
   How does his team compare with last season's at this stage?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much further along,'' said the coach. ``We got more out
of the work because the players understand what we're doing. They
have a better feel for it. It's certainly been more competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll feels no need to soothe the concerns of media and fans
about the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care to do that,'' he said. ``We just need to keep
working. The fans are only going to gauge us on what happens in the
games and not the whole picture of what we've done in the entire
training camp. The fans are only seeing the first unit in the game
for a little more than a quarter in the first two games. For
Dallas, we're going to test them, in that they're going to have to
play a full half in a high altitude. So, physically, they're going
to be taxed.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear from Carroll's demeanor at practice that he's in
charge. He's liable to chew out a player in front of fans and the
media, something he might have done only in private a year ago. For
example, when he didn't like Jones's coverage on Terry Glenn one
day, he yelled, ``That's college stuff! That's not the way we do it
here!'' At his press conferences, Carroll isn't afraid to say who's
hot and who's not.
</P>
<P>
   And when an ex-Patriot is quoted making a disparaging comment,
Carroll declines to respond, as if that player never existed. For
example, Sam Gash recently popped off about how much he hated New
England and how his new coach in Buffalo, Wade Phillips, was so
organized in training camp and such a great coach. (Gash probably
didn't look at Phillips's coaching record before making such
statements.) Carroll offered no counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not going to get into that stuff,'' the coach said.
``It does you no good to get involved. Those players are out of our
picture. We might have to play against them, but we'll play them on
the field, not off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has begun to get more involved in personnel matters. He
has stuck out his neck in expressing a fondness of Jones. He has
told some of his high-priced offensive linemen, such as Todd Rucci,
Max Lane, and Zefross Moss, that their jobs are not protected by
their paychecks and that younger linemen could supplant them.
Despite Shawn Jefferson's fine season a year ago, Carroll has told
Vincent Brisby that he can beat Jefferson out for a job. And the
coach has chosen his words carefully concerning Glenn, praising his
work in camp but going no further, hoping the receiver will make a
personal commitment to being an impact player again.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has put his faith in new offensive coordinator Ernie
Zampese to run the show on that side of the ball. But Carroll has
been more hands-on with the defensive backfield, which is his area
of expertise. He produced excellent secondaries while working as an
assistant in Minnesota and New York, and if Jones turns out to be
the missing link at right corner, Carroll will have created another
solid group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely in charge,'' said linebacker Chris Slade.
``He's demanding in that he never wants you to get complacent. We
hear a lot of good things about our defense, with the way it played
at the end last year, but he's been quick to remind us that we
haven't done anything yet this year, and he's right. We have to
prove ourselves all over again. It's a new season.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among the players was that it was a tough camp,
with Carroll demanding more from them physically than last year,
when there was more classroom training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he went at us pretty good,'' said Law. ``Everybody
should be in good shape to start the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Carroll.

BC'S HOVAN READY FOR HEAVY DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Hovan was hard to miss at Boston College's Media Day
Friday afternoon. As he walked around the new artificial turf at
Alumni Stadium, his confident strut was unmistakable. So, too, were
his massive arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like he's got a pair of small Virginia hams hanging
out his jersey,'' marveled Peter Cronan, BC's radio color analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Page 64 of the BC football media guide will tell you that Hovan
is a 285-pound junior from Rocky River, Ohio, who was an All-Big
East first-teamer last season. But what it doesn't mention is the
10 pounds of muscle he added over the summer. When you take full
measure of Hovan's bulked-up, 6-foot-3-inch, 295-pound physique _
and, of course, those Arm &AMP; Hammer arms _ you get the distinct
impression that no one is going to be kicking sand in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Or running roughshod on BC's defense. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Eagles allowed an average of 200.1 yards per
game, ranging from a season-low of 96 vs. Army to a season-high of
360 vs. Big East foe Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the way Hovan and his defensive teammates hit the
weights over the summer, there is every indication that they intend
to rectify their porous run defense, particularly on the boundary,
where the Eagles appeared so vulnerable last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw how teams ran against us on the boundary last year,''
Hovan said. ``But now we've got some big guys out there. When we
have a guy that's 270 out there. I don't think we're going to have
too many teams running into the boundary that much anymore. I think
we're going to cause a lot of problems for teams that are going to
want to establish the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of eight returning defensive starters, Hovan will be the
strong man at the point of attack from his nose guard spot. Last
season, Hovan registered 58 tackles, including eight for losses of
20 yards, and had four sacks. Certainly, having 10 pounds of added
muscle will help Hovan in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of size you need to compete at the level we're
going to compete at,'' said coach Tom O'Brien. ``But you need all
22 guys you're going to be playing with to be like that. You can't
just have five or six.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the coaching staff recruited size and speed.
Antonio Garay, a highly touted 6-4, 265-pound defensive lineman
from Rahway, N.J., was one player who caught Hovan's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got one recruit from New Jersey who looks pretty good,''
Hovan said. ``But I like seeing how new recruits do in camp. It'll
be nice to see what they do. It's a little bit different in high
school when you're going up against kids. When you get up here, and
go against guys like Damien Woody and Doug Brzezinski, it's a
little different story.''
</P>
<P>
   But was it Hovan's goal to come into camp as BC's strongest
player?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I push myself more,'' he said. ``Before the summer
started, I set goals for myself. I'm not competing against
Brzezinski and I'm not competing against Damien Woody or any of the
strong kids on the team. I know what I have to do. It's a
competition between me and trying to get my goals.''
</P>
<P>
   So did he achieve them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so, but it all goes back to last year when I had a
couple of missed tackles here and there,'' Hovan said. ``When I
trained, it made me want to do that much better to be able to make
that sack or to make that tackle for a loss. That was in the back
of my mind every time I trained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be the best D-line in the Big East, and we had
the whole starting lineup here training all summer. This year,
we're not going to be pushed around. They're going to have to run
through us. We are the strength of the defense this year and we
know it, so we're going to have to perform at that level.''

FOR MARIS, RECORD WAS BARELY WORTH THE HASSLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE DONDONEAU 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, N.D. _ There were no guarantees as to what Bill Weaver
would find in the local sports pages when he was working as a
sportscaster here in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a late game you'd maybe get the box score and that's
it,'' Weaver said. ``And back then, you didn't have highlights on
TV or updates on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   What Weaver did have was a Western Union tickertape machine in
the offices of TV station WDAY/Ch. 6. Every time the New York
Yankees would play, Weaver would invite Rudy Maris, father of New
York Yankees slugger Roger Maris, to the station to sit and watch
the tickertape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just sit there and wait for the updates,'' Weaver said.
``Tick ... tick ... tick ... HR ... tick ... tick ... tick ... NYY
... tick ... tick ... M ... tick ... A ... tick ... it drove us
crazy waiting to see if the next letter would be an N or an R.''
</P>
<P>
   There were more R's than N's that season, but most baseball fans
hoped for more home runs by Mickey Mantle than Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Not Weaver, however, and not North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Maris was the state's claim to fame long before the movie
``Fargo'' with its ``yahs'' and ``you betchas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a state where character is shaped by long winter months and
rainy springs, Maris excelled in a sport more or less looked upon
as something to do between football, fishing and hunting seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1961, this seemed to be the one place where everybody was
pulling for more R's than N's on that tickertape. And if the next
letter was indeed an R, Weaver would break into whatever was being
telecast with a Maris update: ``''Former Fargo Shanley High School
star Roger Maris of the New York Yankees has just hit his 52nd home
run off Frank Lary of the Detroit Tigers ...''''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the regularly scheduled programming.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, 78, smiles when he talks about Maris and his 61 home
runs in 1961. He calls it the most exciting year in sports he's
ever been involved with. And when asked what he thinks of the
assault Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr. are waging on
Maris' record, Weaver takes the cigar from his mouth, cracks a wry
smile and taps the ``61 in '61'' moniker on the golf shirt covering
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Pat Maris (Roger's widow) a few weeks ago that if they
break this record it's going to break my heart,'' Weaver said.
``But you have to be realistic. It looks like it could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``And knowing Roger, I think he'd be happy to know if it was
going to fall it would be to someone like McGwire. He respects the
game, he's a good family man, he seems like a good person from
everything I've read about him.'' Was it worth it? Roger Eugene
Maris was born Sept. 10, 1931. He died of lymphoma cancer in
Houston on Dec. 14, 1985. The inscription on the diamond-shaped
headstone at Maris' gravesite in Fargo reads ``Against All Odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris didn't get much support in his record-setting
season. For starters, he wasn't viewed as a true Yankee _ he was
traded to New York in 1959 from Kansas City. Secondly, he was
chasing ``the'' Yankee immortal, Babe Ruth, and nobody, ``nobody''
beats the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Mickey, his teammate. When Maris and Mantle found
themselves locked in a race for Babe's record, it was Mantle, the
homegrown Yankee, who stole the fans' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who say Roger didn't get along with his teammates, that
they wanted Mickey to break the record and those two didn't get
along, they should have been at Roger's funeral,'' Weaver said. ``I
sat right across from Mickey, and he cried the whole time. The
``whole'' time. They were close.''
</P>
<P>
   And the press? By all accounts Maris never did figure out this
crew. Bill ``Moose'' Skowron, a Yankee teammate in 1961, said the
media put Maris through more hell than he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't leave him alone,'' Skowron said. ``He'd go
0-for-4 and they'd all be around his locker and he'd yell, `Go talk
to Moose or Bobby Richardson, they hit the home runs today!'
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd wish the record was broken today. The damn thing wasn't
worth what he went through.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the time a magazine writer asked Maris if he fooled
around on the road. His wife was home in Kansas City pregnant with
the fourth of their six children, making the question doubly
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was anything for a story,'' Skowron said. ``Mick and Roger,
they would sit in the training room to get away from everyone. The
press used to write that they hated each other. They were
roommates! He shouldn't have had to go through all that.''
Keeping it in
</P>
<P>
   Maris probably endured more than most of his hometown friends
imagined, if for no other reason than Maris rarely talked about
baseball away from the diamond.
</P>
<P>
   He was a private man, married to his high-school sweetheart, Pat
Carvell. He paid for some of his Fargo friends to attend his World
Series games. In a perfect world, he would have gone about his
home-run business in relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   He used to call Sid Cichy, his high school football coach, to
talk about hunting and see how his alma mater, Fargo Shanley, was
doing. Rarely, Cichy said, would Maris even mention the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't any one thing that got to Roger,'' Cichy said. ``It
was the same old questions, over and over. Yak-yak-yak. Every town
was like a circus, over and over. They'd ask him questions just to
ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different now. the Cardinals helped McGwire set up rules
when the press can talk to him and for how long. Roger never had
any of that with the Yankees. He was pretty much left alone to deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cichy's football teams won 15 state titles in 23 seasons.
Ironically, he says one of his worst teams came when Maris played
in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a natural athlete,'' Cichy said. ``There was a
game against Devils Lake where he returned five kickoffs for
touchdowns. After the game the opposing coach said they were afraid
to score because of him. I thought, `Why not just on-side kick?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger was good. He could have played football at a major
college. Baseball was just something he kept getting better at.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Cichy are two of a handful of Maris' friends who've
worked to keep his legacy alive. Every year, they help organize the
Roger Maris Celebrity Golf Tournament played in the last week of
June. Whitey Ford, Whitey Herzog, Mickey Mantle, Skowron, Hank
Bauer, Bob Costas and Bobby Knight are just a few of the
celebrities who have come to Fargo to play golf and help raise more
than $500,000 for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   You can also visit the Roger Maris Museum, stroll down Maris
Drive near a local ballpark, or visit the Roger Maris Cancer
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what it will take for people to understand the type
of person Maris really was. Don Gooselaw, Maris' childhood friend,
said the idea for the Maris Museum blossomed when another local,
Jim McLaughlin, wrote to Maris asking for some of his memorabilia
so they could display it in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   He gave them everything he had that Cooperstown didn't want.
</P>
<P>
   Typical Maris, his friends say.
Changing attitudes
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris will always be a hero in his hometown, no matter how
many home runs McGwire or Griffey or Sosa hits this season. Outside
North Dakota, however, maybe this year's spotlight on the home run
chase will change some opinions about Maris.
</P>
<P>
   His friends hope so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember going to Yankee Stadium in 1984 to watch
Roger get his number retired,'' Cichy said. ``The old-timers game
was pretty boring, so I walked up the steps at Yankee Stadium to
stretch my legs and I ran across a very tall, dour looking usher.
When I told him I was from Fargo he got this ... look. He started
shaking his head. `Nobody,' he said, `nobody should have ever
broken the Babe's record.' Then he turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really how everyone seemed to feel about Roger back
then.''

   Forget the truck rollovers, four-car accidents, and disabled
vehicles that are often sprinkled into the
``traffic-on-the-threes'' report. The three words on the car radio
that will cause drivers to shudder this morning are ``Falmouth Road
Race.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is the one day a year when traffic on the Sagamore and
Bourne Bridges is even worse than usual, virtually grinding to a
stop as thousands of people flock to the Lower Cape to watch or run
the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Falmouth Road Race.
</P>
<P>
   In its 26th year, the 7.1-mile race _ barely longer than a
10-kilometer run _ has mushroomed in popularity to the point where
it now attracts 9,000 runners and 75,000 spectators. And stops
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mini-Boston Marathon,'' said Bill Rodgers. ``It's
tradition, no race can reproduce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's biased about the race, having won it three
times. In fact, it was Rodgers's victory in 1974 that put Falmouth
on the international racing calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the race's second year, when this unknown kid named
Will Rodgers _ that's what he was called then _ won the race and
beat Marty Liquori,'' said co-director Rich Sherman. ``That was big
news and got a lot of press.''
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Olympic gold medalist Frank Shorter won, and
the race has been snowballing ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's field includes the defending champions, Khalid
Khannouchi of Morocco and Colleen De Reuck of South Africa, women's
course record-holder Catherine Ndereba of Kenya, three-time Boston
Marathon winner Uta Pippig, six-time women's champion _ and
defending masters champ _ Joan Benoit Samuelson, plus Rodgers and
Shorter, who will be vying for the seniors title (50-and-over).
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the elite runners, you can add the
mother-daughter-granddaughter team, the 17 members of the ``65-Plus
Running Club'' (spearheaded by an 80-year-old), the cancer survivor
and her son, the six runners from Hawaii and three from Alaska, and
you have the mix that makes up Falmouth.
</P>
<P>
   A little, but not much, has changed since the first race.
Results that were compiled by hand for the 90 runners in 1973 are
now done by computer. The Brothers Four bar that was the landmark
at the finish line is gone, but the race still starts from Captain
Kidd's in Woods Hole. And the starting time stubbornly remains at
10 a.m., despite the fact that most summer races begin two hours
earlier because of heat and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many people driving in from off Cape, and there are
so many logistics to deal with that we have to,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   When Tommy Leonard, the former bartender at Boston's Eliot
Lounge, came up with the brainstorm for a race 26 years ago, he
approached Carroll, who was the girls' track coach at Falmouth
High, and Sherman, who was the town's recreation director.
</P>
<P>
   Like kids planning a play, the three thought about it, looked at
each other, and said, ``Let's put on a race!''
</P>
<P>
   So they did, and on a Wednesday afternoon in August, in
near-hurricane weather _ high winds and driving rain _ 90 runners
made the dash from one bar in Woods Hole to another one in Falmouth
Heights. The Falmouth Road Race was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it was then, we could have done it in a week,'' said
Carroll. Now he and Sherman, along with their wives, co-directors
Lucia Carroll and Kathleen Sherman, will barely take a breath
before they start thinking about next year's race.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 16,000 entries start going out on May 1 and start
coming back almost immediately; the first 8,000 are accepted on a
first-come, first-return basis. The directors do give some extra
consideration to Falmouth residents and they look over late entries
asking for special attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they're valid, and sometimes not,'' Carroll said.
``If we could accept everybody, we'd have 25,000.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those who got a special waiver this year is Joyce Supple,
of Hampton Falls, N.H. Supple, 68, didn't start running until she
was 47 years old, when she trained for the Marine Corps Marathon,
then entered the Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Supple hasn't run any marathons since 1979, but she still runs 6
miles five times a week ``just to keep in shape.'' So when her
46-year-old daughter, Robin, and 22-year-old granddaughter, Kelsa,
entered Falmouth, Supple wrote to the directors to let her in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I could do pretty good in my age bracket,'' her letter
said in part. ``PLEASE let me run.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, so the three generations can run side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Another family affair involves 51-year-old Jim Kelley, of
Wakefield, R.I., and his 24-year-old daughter Beth, of Washington,
D.C. It'll be his 20th Falmouth race, her 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman and Carroll sound upbeat about this ``job,'' despite the
fact that they've been devoting 18 hours a day to it for the past
week, and that they'll get up at 5 a.m. Sunday to get ready to face
the throngs.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have real jobs to go back to, Sherman as an
insurance agent and Carroll as an English teacher and track coach.
Carroll allows that the race eventually will take its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm `50-ish,''' he said, ``but I'm not going to get another 26
years out of this.''

LIBERTY BEATS HOUSTON, 70-54  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Liberty point guard Teresa Weatherspoon left
Saturday afternoon's home game against the Houston Comets with 1
minute 34 seconds to go, she pumped her fist in the air. It was a
celebration not only of the Liberty's victory, but also an
acknowledgment of the first Liberty sell-out crowd of 19,563 _ the
third-largest in Women's National Basketball Association history _
at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon's gesture punctuated what had been a remarkable
performance by the Liberty as they jumped all over Houston (15-3),
routing the defending WNBA champions, 70-54.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty (18-10) outrebounded Houston by 41-25, holding the
Comets to only 30 percent shooting from the field, including 5 of
19 from behind the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty guard Sophia Witherspoon scored a game-high 21 points to
lead four Liberty players in double figures. Houston guard Cynthia
Cooper finished with 17 points to lead the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   The victory keeps the Liberty in first place in the Eastern
Conference with the Cleveland Rockers, who played the Washington
Mystics Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   If the Liberty beats Cleveland at home Monday night, it will
clinch a playoff spot regardless of what other teams do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team was just very determined,'' Liberty Coach Nancy
Darsch said. ``We just said nobody was taking this away from us
right now. This was our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game was about more than staying in the WNBA playoff
race.
</P>
<P>
   It was also about finding out if the Liberty, with the end of
the regular season near, could play with Houston, a team that
Darsch says is in a class by itself.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Liberty forward Vickie Johnson opened the game
with a 3-pointer from the right side, there was no backing down.
The Liberty was not about to have a repeat of last month's debacle,
when it fell behind by 13-0 and 40-12, losing the game by 79-54. In
fact, the lead only grew, as Johnson came back with another
3-pointer to give the Liberty a 21-9 lead with 12:33 to go in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Houston, a team that features Cooper, Sheryl
Swoopes and Tina Thompson, three of the best offensive players in
the WNBA. A Houston run seemed inevitable, especially when Swoopes
nailed a long 3-pointer from the top of the key with 3:32 in the
half that closed the Liberty's lead to 6 at 31-25. They drew no
closer, however, as the Liberty took a 35-27 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Houston desperately tried to claw back into the game early in
the second half when Weatherspoon drove hard on forward Janeth
Arcain and was called for an offensive foul with 11:07 to go in the
game. Weatherspoon protested, and she promptly drew a technical
foul. This sparked a brief Houston run that was capped by a Cooper
3-pointer. It was 50-42 with 9:46 to go, and Houston seemed to be
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Lobo, who had 13 points and 12 rebounds for the Liberty,
said: ``I said to Weatherspoon when we were shooting around before
the game that last time we played Houston, our team had a different
look about them. I sensed that our team couldn't wait to get out
there and play and show our fans the difference in this team.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than five minutes later, Johnson found herself
behind the 3-point line on the left side with the ball in her
hands. The Liberty was ahead by 59-46 and a 3-pointer would dash
Houston's comeback hopes. Her shot swished through the basket with
4:13 left, bringing the crowd to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into the game wanting to play good basketball and
wanting to win,'' Weatherspoon said. ``Now we have to move on to
the next game _ be happy for what we did today but leave it here
and prepare for the next game.''

AMERICAN FOOTBALL A WINNER IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Diego Perez, a lanky and slightly cocky
17-year-old quarterback, wears a faded New England Patriots cap and
calls himself ``the Mexican Bledsoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan de la Fuente Rodriguez, 12, another quarterback, dreams of
one day playing for a professional team, just like his idol, Dan
Marino.
</P>
<P>
   And 11-year-old Jose Antonio Ramirez, an offensive guard who
looks like a big lime in his bright green uniform when he squats
for a block, wants to be good enough to earn a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   In a country better known for its love of soccer and loyalty to
baseball, these are the dreams of a growing number of Mexican boys:
to play American-style football. It's one sign of the surge in
popularity the sport is enjoying south of the border, according to
sports promoters in both Mexico and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign will be visible Monday night, when the Patriots
face the Dallas Cowboys in an exhibition game at Azteca Stadium
here that will be broadcast internationally and is expected to draw
the largest crowd ever to see an NFL game. The previous record of
112,000 was set here four years ago for an exhibition game between
the Cowboys and Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in football is all over the country,'' said
Miguel Angel Mesa, director of Mexico's National Sports Commission,
a federal government agency that oversees most of the country's
amateur and professional sports leagues. ``And the growth is
especially strong among our youth.''
</P>
<P>
   The interest in American football has grown so much in recent
years that last week the NFL announced it will open an office in
Mexico City this fall. The one-person operation will work mostly on
licensing and promotion but will also develop new flag-football
leagues throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is the largest population of new football fans in the
world,'' said Pete Abitante, a league spokesman. ``You can't find
anyplace outside the US where there is so much enthusiasm for
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, according to Mexican government estimates, there are more
than 20 football associations that field about 4,000 teams for
almost 150,000 players, most of them between ages 5 to 19. And
about one-third of the $260 million the NFL earns in international
merchandising every year comes from Mexico, according to league
figures.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt television and radio have had much to do with the
sport's rising popularity. On any weekend in Mexico during football
season, an armchair quarterback can watch as many as a dozen
telecasts, including local college games, the NCAA, and NFL. More
NFL franchises are also broadcasting their games here on
Spanish-language radio.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing efforts by the NFL to tap a larger audience are
similar to those recently developed by both Major League Baseball
and the National Basketball Association to cultivate larger
audiences in Mexico, where all three leagues have played either
exhibition or regular-season games during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Played for decades
</P>
<P>
   Football is not new to Mexico. From Chihuahua to Chiapas, the
sport has been played on dirt playgrounds, streets, and old soccer
fields for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Constantine, a Yale graduate and US businessman,
organized the country's first formal team in 1927 at the National
Autonomous University, a public institution in Mexico City. A few
years later, an American priest, Fr. Lambert J. Dennis, organized
another team at Politechnic Institute, a crosstown private
university. Every November, both teams play ``El Clasico,'' the
country's most storied college football rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, another annual football matchup was created _ the
Aztec Bowl, featuring All-American college players from the US and
a team from Mexico, and the games were played in a new field _
known today as Olympic Stadium _ in the southern part of Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   The country has flirted with professional football but has never
formed its own league or managed to land a coveted NFL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL played its first game here in 1978, between the
Philadelphia Eagles and New Orleans Saints at Olympic Stadium.
During the 1980s, a semi-pro league made up mostly of
post-collegiate players was formed, Mesa said, but the effort
failed to attract enough corporate sponsorship. The players, who
were paid roughly $100 per game, left the league.
</P>
<P>
   But football supporters here say the climate today is much
different for cultivating a professional team or even another
league. The growth of multinational corporations looking for
cross-border promotion and more flexible labor laws as a result of
the North American Free Trade Agreement signed earlier this decade
would make such an investment more possible, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we can play football all year long _ that is a very
attractive factor,'' said Enrique Estanol, a spokesman for the
country's American Football Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Football's image has also changed in the eyes of many Mexicans.
Though the game once was seen as a graceless and brutal sport that
lacked the finesse of soccer or the strategy of baseball, coaches,
supporters, and even the players themselves now use terms like
``discipline,'' ``teamwork,'' and ``character building'' when
describing the virtues of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it's an aggressive sport, but it's aggression only for
that play and for that moment,'' said Saul Shmulkovsky, 29, the
coordinator of a youth league in the Coyoacan neighborhood of the
city. ``These players are taught to leave it on the field and not
take those feelings on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Same colors, strict rules
</P>
<P>
   Youth football leagues are among the most organized and
structured sports activities in Mexico, Mesa said, even when
compared with some of the older soccer and baseball leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are strict. The self-congratulatory dancing and
showboating done by professionals and some college players is
forbidden in the youth leagues. Some teams even prohibit players
from giving high-fives to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the other youth teams in Mexico, Shmulkovsky's
team, ``Los Huracanes,'' (the Hurricanes), adopts mascots and team
colors identical to many US teams. The Hurricanes, for example,
wear the same neon green and orange uniforms used by the University
of Miami Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   For most Mexicans, the favorite NFL team is the Cowboys, who
have developed a fan base partly out of geographic proximity but
also because of their pioneering efforts in the 1970s to market
heavily to Hispanic and Mexican audiences. Today a teenager is just
as likely to be wearing an Emmitt Smith or Deion Sanders jersey as
one for Cruz Azul, Toluca, or any other Mexican soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Other favorite NFL teams mentioned often by fans here are the
San Francisco 49ers, the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Miami Dolphins,
and the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Buffalo Bills the best,'' said Ramirez, an
11-year-old guard for the Hurricanes. Although he couldn't name a
single Bills player, he was certain of his reason why.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played in the first Super Bowl I ever saw on
television,'' he added. ``And they've been my favorite team ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   An NFL dream
</P>
<P>
   Mexican sports promoters and government officials hope that one
day soon the NFL will approve a franchise in Mexico City. But
league officials aren't offering any immediate signs that will
happen. Mexico City applied during the last expansion round but
lost to Jacksonville and Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city's continuing battles with an unstable
economy and rising crime have undermined its image for tourism and
investment. In interviews published in Mexican newspapers late last
week, players and coaches from the Cowboys and Patriots sounded
less than enthusiastic about playing here.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexican football fans keep dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a team here would be something of a risk, but I think
it would be an excellent idea and very popular,'' said Mesa, the
government sports commission official. ``It would have to be an
American team with a Mexican point of view, like the name or the
colors or the coaches. It must be distinctly Mexican.''

TYSON DUCKS A PUNCH IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the pressure on and his chances growing bleaker by the
minute, Mike Tyson stayed true to form this past week. He quit
rather than fight.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the strong possibility of a second straight defeat to
boxing authorities, Tyson did the same thing before the New Jersey
State Athletic Control Board that he did when facing Evander
Holyfield in their tawdry rematch 14 months ago. He disqualified
himself.
</P>
<P>
   At least the members of the licensing body in New Jersey left
with their ears intact, which is more than Holyfield could say.
Only days after that sorry disqualification caused a near-riot in
the MGM Grand Casino, Tyson's license to box was revoked in Nevada
and he has not fought since.
</P>
<P>
   When he was eligible to reapply on July 9, Tyson ignored the
state that had penalized him and instead asked New Jersey to grant
him a license with a promise to bring his lucrative first bout to
Atlantic City. That was like committing a bank robbery in
Massachusetts and asking for a parole hearing in California, but
Tyson and his chief adviser, Shelly Finkel, concluded that
everybody is as callous and money-hungry as they are and the board
would roll over for the bribe Finkel guaranteed New Jersey's tax
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't roll over. Faced with a fight, Tyson pulled out
Thursday afternoon and asked for a hearing in Nevada, which will be
granted within three weeks. That action came less than 24 hours
before Tyson was to have learned his fate, although several sources
said Friday that the media and political pressure on the board's
two voting members had grown so intense that the former heavyweight
champion was tipped off that it was unlikely he would gain
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, it appeared the skids had been well greased for
Tyson's return, but media pressure began to build after New Jersey
agreed to grant Tyson a hearing on his application by citing a
legal loophole that allowed the state to ignore Nevada's ruling
because it had revoked, not suspended, his license.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism escalated when Tyson appeared to lose his cool
during the July 29 hearing, cursing to his lawyer when questioned
again by a New Jersey assistant state attorney about his actions in
the Holyfield fight. That led New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman to
privately make clear how closely she would be watching the vote of
the two appointed board members.
</P>
<P>
   Then New Jersey State Sen. William Gormley came out heavily
against granting Tyson a license, saying the fighter should return
to Nevada before seeking to fight in another state. The fact that
Gormley is the brother of one of the two men who would have voted
on Tyson's application only heightened the glare.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, US Sen. John McCain, a strong friend of boxing who is
seeking federal regulation of the sport, blasted the idea of Tyson
seeking a license anywhere but the state in which he had been
disciplined, saying, ``I don't believe Tyson should be licensed. I
think he should go back to Nevada and ask for a hearing and ask for
his license to be restored there.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what Tyson did Thursday afternoon, a move his
lawyer claimed was a shock but one that others said was a product
of learning that the scam he was trying to run in New Jersey was
about to come to an ignominious end.
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, huckster Jeff Wald, another Tyson adviser,
told The New York Times Thursday that ``Sen. John McCain has been a
real friend of boxing in Washington. He came out this week and said
he was dismayed that Mike Tyson was going around the law he had
written. We have enough respect for Sen. McCain not to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's law requires that all states honor suspensions against
fighters made in other states, but since Nevada had revoked Tyson's
license, his attorneys found a legal loophole and tried to exploit
it. Apparently nobody told them about all the respect Wald, Finkel,
and Tyson have for Sen. McCain's law. My guess is nobody mentioned
it to Tyson, either.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, Whitman, and McCain all said they were elated by
Tyson's ``decision'' and Whitman denied that Tyson had been leaked
information that he would not be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased Mr. Tyson has decided to bring his request for
reinstatement back to the Nevada State Athletic Commission,''
McCain said. ``This is where the decision properly rests.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Commission, said
it would take two to three weeks to get a hearing set up and that
he wanted the full five-person board on hand to hear the case.
Unlike New Jersey, Nevada will vote on Tyson's application the same
day as the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, assumes that Tyson doesn't pull out of that
fight _ or bite off a commissioner's ear _ if it gets tough.
</P>
<P>
   When told of Tyson's decision, the man who disqualified him
against Holyfield, Mills Lane, said the former champion had done
the right thing by going back to the scene of the crime and now
would ``face the music. They'll make him answer some tough
questions. He's going to have to stand there and take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, can he?
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Chances of an  &UR; Ike Quartey &LR; - &UR; Felix Trinidad  &LR; fight in November
continued to fade, even though no decision has been made by federal
judge  &UR; Lawrence McKenna  &LR; on the validity of a new promotional
contract signed by Trinidad with Quartey's promoter,  &UR; Dino Duva &LR; .
That's because Quartey is claiming he has contracted malaria and
will be unable to fight  &UR; Andrei Pestriaev  &LR; this month in France.
Quartey, the story goes, was the subject of death threats during a
visit to France for a press conference announcing the fight and is
reluctant to return. That's the World Boxing Association
welterweight champion's story, at least. Others believe the malaria
story is merely his latest shot in an ongoing dispute with his
former promoters, the Acaries brothers. The French-based promoters
are suing Quartey to retain control of his contract and many in
boxing believe Quartey's claim of malaria is merely a way to avoid
putting his title at risk in a country where his enemies have a
good deal of power to manipulate fight officials ... Although
attorneys for the Duvas publicly remained optimistic about their
chances in the Trinidad contract dispute with rival promoter  &UR; Don
King &LR; , &UR;  &LR; privately they have told associates their chances are no
better than 50-50 because Trinidad signed a bout agreement for a
fight with  &UR; Troy Waters  &LR; that included a clause extending his
promotional contract with King. When Trinidad produced that bout
agreement only days before the one-day trial was to begin _ after
having assured Duva he had turned over all of his paperwork
involving King _ Duva's longtime attorney  &UR; Pat English  &LR; allegedly
went ballistic. English still believes King has breached the
contract but he also knows the existence of a new agreement between
Trinidad and King is a major legal obstacle ... At a press
conference last week in Atlanta to announce the  &UR; Evander
Holyfield &LR; - &UR; Vaughn Bean  &LR; International Boxing Federation
heavyweight title fight at the Georgia Dome, King looked down at
the soft-spoken Bean and said of his chances, ``He's going to be
charging and trying to hit the lottery. Powerball! Now you know the
number is my game. Now they line up for Powerball but when I was
doing it they were trying to put you in jail for it.'' King is an
old numbers runner from Cleveland ... Holyfield stands to make at
least $3.5 million for the Bean fight, while the IBF's No. 1
contender will receive just under $2 million. That is nearly a
million less than Bean could have earned fighting Tyson ... Aware
that Bean brings little to the table beyond a No. 1 ranking few
people can understand, King has priced the 42,000-seat Georgia Dome
to sell. More than 25,000 of the seats will go for $50, $35, or
$25, unheard of prices for a heavyweight title fight. The hope is
that local corporations will buy blocks of cheap seats and give
them to charities and youth groups to paper the house with faces
... Heavyweight prospect  &UR; Kirk Johnson  &LR; improved to 26-0 by easily
handling trial horse  &UR; Levi Billups  &LR; at the Cour D'Alene Tribal
Bingo Hall in Worley, Idaho, recently ... A big shakeup is rumored
to be in the works at ESPN, with longtime fight manager  &UR; Bill
Cayton  &LR; moving in as a consultant and possibly veteran Philadelphia
fight promoter  &UR; J. Russell Peltz  &LR; taking over as matchmaker. Where
this would leave  &UR; Bob Yalen &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has been running ESPN's boxing
shows for some time, is unclear. ESPN recently purchased the rights
to Cayton's vast library of fight films, which is believed to be
the largest in the world, to use on its Classic Sports Network. It
made that move to block a similar plan by Fox, which was close to a
deal with Cayton. Reportedly, part of the ESPN deal is for Cayton
to serve as a consultant. Cayton has been advocating a shakeup in
the network's lineup of broadcasters as well as bringing in Peltz
... Speaking of televised boxing, as USA Network's final show
approaches on Aug. 25, word is TNT will televise not only a
September fight card but also one in December or January while
ESPN2 continues plans for a 40-show series with a new format that
would mix a live fight with a classic one from Cayton's library.
The latter is an idea that could sell ...  &UR; Andrew Golota's  &LR; Sept. 4
fight in Poland vs.  &UR; Tim Witherspoon  &LR; has been postponed until Oct.
2 because of the cut Golota sustained in his win over  &UR; Corey
Sanders &LR;  ... Former heavyweight champion  &UR; Michael Moorer  &LR; is
involved in one of the most dangerous endeavors imaginable for a
guy with his problems. He's in cooking school ... Old friend  &UR; Doug
Pendarvis  &LR; is back in the boxing business with a show set for
Saturday night at the Wallace Civic Center in Fitchburg that
features fast-rising  &UR; Jason Pires &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the undefeated New Bedford
junior featherweight, who will make his first step into the big
time against  &UR; Shawn Powell  &LR; in a 12-round fight for the vacant US
Boxing Association junior featherweight title. Pires (11-0, 7 KOs)
is being handled by  &UR; Jim Troy  &LR; and promoter  &UR; Cedric Kushner  &LR; and
has shown enough promise to be considered possibly the next
world-class New England fighter. A win Saturday night would assure
him of a world rating after just 12 professional fights. The
undercard will feature another Troy fighter of promise, Atlanta
mid-dleweight  &UR; Lawrence Chapman  &LR; (10-0, 8 KOs), a member of a
boxing team sponsored by Holyfield. The  &UR; Sims  &LR; twins,  &UR; Trave  &LR; (5-0)
and  &UR; Travis  &LR; (3-0) of Norwalk, Conn., are also on the card. Tickets
are $30 ringside, $20 general admission. For info, call
978-345-7300, ext. 615, or 617-825-3283.

CUP FINAL DOUBLY CHARMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY _ She's been to a shopping mall or two along Route 9
(``Shopping, that's what I really enjoy to do''), feasted at the
Cheesecake Factory, tapped into the Young Ladies Network about how
to play an opponent unknown to her, and even showed up a few hours
early to scout her possible opponent if she made it into the final.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Schett made it to the Boston Cup final, all right,
beating Cara Black, 6-2, 2-6, 6-2, Saturday at Babson College.
</P>
<P>
   And Schett, bubbly and bright, is excited that she's in her
first final on the WTA circuit. ``It would be fantastic,'' she
said, ``to win my first tournament on the hardcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   Schett, a 22-year-old Austrian, was aided in the semifinal by
tips from Elena Likhovtseva, who had lost to Black in a
quarterfinal Friday night. ``Elena told me she'd had so many
chances, that she was up in every game against (Black), and she
told me I just had to play aggressive,'' said Schett, who never had
played Black. ``Elena told me Black was not playing very fast, and
she was right, I would say. And Elena told me (Black's) forehand
was a little weak. Elena gave me good tips.''
</P>
<P>
   A confident Schett used those tips to easily dispose of Black, a
19-year-old from Zimbabwe, mixing her serves, smashing her overhand
shots, and deftly slipping her backhands an inch or two inside the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's 2 p.m. final, Schett will meet Mariaan de Swardt,
who defeated third-seeded Lisa Raymond, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, in the other
semifinal. The powerful de Swardt happily acknowledges that she
``runs around'' her backhand _ a no-no even on the public courts _
because her forehand is so strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole game is basically to set up her forehand,'' Raymond
said of de Swardt. ``That's her entire game, really ... her
forehand.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, agreed de Swardt, who was ranked 50th in the world
coming into the Boston Cup. ``I know the other players are always
coming after my backhand,'' she said. ``One of my biggest goals is
to run around my backhands and hit forehands, my strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Schett, ``Mariaan is playing very well and I'm going to
expect a couple of aces (Sunday) from her ... like, 30 or 40. My
strategy, I think, will be to make her run.''
</P>
<P>
   Schett had Black constantly on the run Saturday, Schett in full
control of her shots and the pace of play most suitable to her.
``For me, it's always nice that someone doesn't play very fast,''
said Schett, the 29th-ranked woman in the world, ``because I have
the time and I can set the point. That's what I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though she won the first set easily, Schett lost her focus
in the second game of the second set, when she thought three calls
went against her. What was so difficult about the calls, explained
Schett, ``is that you can't do anything about them. Clay court, you
can go and show the mark, but on hardcourt, you just have to accept
it. But it's so hard to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   After what she considered ``really bad calls against me,''
Schett said she wasn't able to concentrate. ``My head wasn't on the
court any more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schett said she didn't regain her composure until three games
later _ ``at love-4, I started to play again and I told myself,
`Well, now this is your chance again; you start again''' _ but by
then the second set was beyond recall. So her strategy was to
position herself so that she would be on serve to open the third
set. ``That was very big for her,'' said Black, ``to start with the
serve.'' Schett did so, and coasted home.
</P>
<P>
   Black, for her part, was thinking at the start of that third set
how she had come back the previous night and won the third after
starting poorly. ``I was trying to repeat that,'' she said. ``But
when things didn't work well (such as Schett breaking her serve in
the second game), I started getting nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Schett's only worry in that final set came when two birds
perched on the net while she was serving in the fifth game (``I
didn't want to kill a bird''). Best of all, she said, ``I felt very
comfortable out there. I was pretty sure I'd win the match.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will try very hard,'' said the Austrian. ``I will fight.''

CHANGES FAIL TO STIR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under the glare of an afternoon sun and a national TV audience,
the Dodgers looked particularly pale.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was supposed to be a showcase event, the Fox owned
Dodgers on Fox television playing the National League's best team,
the Atlanta Braves. Playoff preview? How about programming blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers still have a mathematical chance of
reaching the postseason, the truth is 1998 just never added up.
</P>
<P>
   If the Chicago Cubs, who lead for the final playoff spot, play
just .500 the rest of the way, the Dodgers would have to go 26-14
in their last 40 games to catch them. For a team that has not won
four consecutive games all season, that is a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   From the May 15 trade that sent their best player, Mike Piazza,
to the Florida Marlins, to the firing of general manager Fred
Claire and the hiring of Tom Lasorda to the overall rotten play of
the $61 million club, nothing has gone right.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch's Fox Group bought the team in March and brokered
the deal for Piazza without checking that Bobby Bonilla, the leader
they thought they got in return, was coming off two major
operations and would be doing most of his work from the trainer's
room.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism that Lasorda overpaid in trading for veteran
players during a stretch run that really doesn't exist, he did it
to save his job. Most people would do the same, especially when
given $12 million for improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But a sadder commentary was the vulgar, profanity-laced tirade
Lasorda gave the Long Beach Press-Telegram this past week aimed at
former manager Bill Russell. Lasorda was ranting while the Dodgers
were dropping 2 of 3 to the last-place Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Where is his focus? On the team or on a guy he helped get fired?
</P>
<P>
   ``Should things be better, sure they should,'' said Bonilla, who
has been booed repeatedly by fans the past two weeks. ``But this is
a team that has gotten a new owner, a new general manager, a new
manager, traded their best player and have been wiped out by
injuries. Tell me how many teams could overcome that?''
</P>
<P>
   Most fans aren't buying it. Friday night, for the first time
this season, attendance slipped below last year's average per game
of 38,090 after 58 dates. The Dodgers, 61-62 with Saturday's loss,
didn't make the postseason in 1997 and haven't won a playoff game
since the World Series title in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds are skeptical and often hostile. When new club
president Bob Graziano was introduced Friday night during
ceremonies for Hall of Famer Don Sutton, he was loudly booed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more telling is the indifference of the national
baseball scene to one of the game's more high profile teams. When
Sports Illustrated came to Dodger Stadium, it wasn't to do a story
on the Dodgers troubles, but about the Braves bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Raul Mondesi has complained he is still getting
taunted by fans in the bleachers about his early season drunk
driving arrest. The more he talks about it the more the issue
refuses to go away.
</P>
<P>
   When Piazza left, the club hoped Mondesi would step up as a team
leader. They gave him a four-year contract worth $36 million. He
showed glimpses of his potential greatness with 30 home runs and 30
stolen bases last season. This year he leads the Dodgers with 26
home runs and remains the club's most exciting player. But he still
is a free swinger that continues to frustrate coaches and
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he could be more selective at the plate, we'd be talking
right now about him as an MVP candidate,'' third base Joey
Amalfitano said. ``But until he does that, we'll just be talking
about his potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership has been the biggest problem for the Dodgers the past
decade. It hurt that their best player Piazza wanted nothing to do
with the job. Eric Karros was a leader for awhile, but retreated
last year after he was criticized by teammates for his part in an
altercation with pitcher Ismael Valdes. Eric Young is a fiery type,
but the role doesn't fell naturally to non sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   New manager Glenn Hoffman has better people skills than his
predecessor Russell, but the players are convinced Lasorda pulls
all the strings. When four coaches were fired in June, Lasorda said
it was Hoffman's call. No one believed him.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda's enthusiasm revived pitchers like Valdes and Chan Ho
Park. But now Valdes is out with a strained side muscle and is
progressing slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In past seasons, players would have pointed fingers. But this
year, they don't even seem to have the energy for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say why the team is so fragile emotionally,''
said hitting instructor Mickey Hatcher, a key member of the 1988
World Series club. ``There is just no confidence here. There is
more talent than there was with us. But if we had a lead in the
seventh, eighth or nine innings we won. We beat the bad teams. It
only takes a play or two to get players to believe. But we aren't
making those plays.''
</P>
<P>
   That was never more obvious when the Dodgers went 3-6 during a
recent nine-game stretch against Montreal, Pittsburgh and Florida,
three of the league's weaker clubs. The Dodgers have 101 errors.
Only the Expos and Pirates have more.
</P>
<P>
   The team points to the injuries that have plagued the club all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, the ace of the staff, is out after having
surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros, who had more than 30 homers and 100
RBI in each of the past three seasons, missed the first 22 games of
the season after undergoing knee surgery during the final week of
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Eric Young, who received a four-year, $18.5
million contract during the winter, missed 32 games with a strained
left thigh muscle, including 18 when he was on the disabled list
from July 14-31.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Jose Vizcaino, who signed a three-year, $8.5 million
contract before the season, severely sprained his right ankle June
20 and hasn't played since. The Dodgers acquired Mark Grudzielanek
with Carlos Perez to play short, but Vizcaino's steady defense has
been missed.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was brought in to play third base and he has been on the
disabled list twice. He even was moved to left field in favor of
rookie Adrian Beltre, who was promoted to the big leagues from
Double-A San Antonio. Many players think Lasorda's decision to play
Beltre is premature and bullheaded.
</P>
<P>
   He has shown enormous potential, but just as often seems
overmatched. He was given Saturday off, replaced by Bonilla, who
drove in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The future?
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who was given the job on an interim basis despite his
lifelong dream to become a general manager, has begun a search for
his replacement. Fox likes Florida's Dave Dombrowski and
Cincinnati's Jim Bowden also is a candidate. The interview process
is expected to begin in early September.
</P>
<P>
   An additional player might be picked up for the final month. The
Dodgers are hoping Vizcaino returns so they can make an evaluation
on the future at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman probably won't be back. Neither will Bonilla and maybe
Young or Karros. Right now, the team is committed to paying $53.3
million in guaranteed salary to just 12 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is frustrated,'' Graziano said. ``The players are
frustrated, management is frustrated, Fox is frustrated. But they
also recognize a lot has gone on this year. They are in it for the
long haul and so are we.''

SHAMING SHAMELESS UNOFFICIAL SPONSORS

<P>
   The US Olympic Committee is using a new weapon in its fight
against ``ambush marketers'' who try to wrap themselves with the
Olympic rings without paying sponsorship fees: public shame.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC plans to name violators and list their phone numbers in
print ads that ask readers: ``How do you feel about cheating in the
Olympic Games?''
</P>
<P>
   The latest tiff involves Utah's Wasatch Brewery, which is
billing itself ``the unofficial beer, 2002 Winter Games.'' Since
Anheuser-Busch is paying $50 million for the right to be the
official beer, the USOC has gone to war.
</P>
<P>
   Wasatch says it's doing nothing wrong, since it isn't using the
word ``Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has claim on 2002,'' says brewery owner Greg Schirf,
``and everyone uses the word `games.'''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Michelle Smith's  &LR; four-year ban for dumping whiskey in her
urine sample, which keeps her out of the 2000 Olympics and 2001
World Championships, is essentially a life sentence. By the 2004
Games, Smith will be 34, a grandma in swimming terms. Meanwhile her
rivals, who always suspected the Irish swimmer was doped, are
cackling. ``What goes around comes around,'' says  &UR; Cristina
Teuscher &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whom Smith beat in the 400 freestyle in Atlanta.
Smith's disgrace isn't even the worst scandal for Irish swimming. A
recent government report concluded that two former national coaches
(one of whom is serving a 12-year prison sentence) sexually abused
teenage swimmers for years, and it has recommended nearly 100
reforms ... Though US swimmer  &UR; Gary Hall  &LR; ducked a possible
two-year ban for marijuana use last week when the international
federation lifted its provisional suspension, he'll essentially be
on the sidelines for a year anyway. Because the ban was lifted
after the deadline for last week's US championships, Hall couldn't
qualify for four international meets next year, including the Pan
American Games and the Pan Pacific meet, which will be held in
Sydney's Olympic pool. Hall, who tested positive for marijuana for
the second time in a May meet, had argued that his first test (at
the 1996 Olympics) shouldn't count because the drug wasn't
officially on the banned list until after the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Unless the NBA players want to play in Guadalajara in July to
qualify for the 2000 Olympics, the US may want to stick with the
plucky band of CBAers, European pros, and collegians that managed a
bronze medal last weekend at the World Championships in Athens.
Though the Yanks have never failed to qualify for the Games, the
zonal qualifier won't be a gimme: Only the top two teams make it to
Sydney. The Olympic field will also include world champion
Yugoslavia (i.e. Greater Serbia), host Australia, five teams from
Europe, and one apiece from Africa, Asia, and Oceania. The
Americans are automatic for the next world event in 2002, though,
since Indianapolis is host. The US women, who beat Russia for the
world title in June, have qualified for both the Olympics and
worlds ... As predicted after the fiasco in Nagano, the
International Skating Union has shaken up ice dancing to make it
closer to an actual sport. Starting next season, difficult elements
such as lifts, pirouettes, and step sequences will be required in
the free dance, judges will make specific deductions for mistakes
both there and in the original dance, and the technical mark will
break ties in the compulsories. Also, to reduce the chance that
judges play Let's Make a Deal before the competition, a new panel
will judge each stage.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Whoever ends up coaching the US men's national soccer team may
also coach the 2000 Olympic team, which will likely provide the
bulk of the players for the 2002 World Cup squad. That could give
an edge to D.C. United coach  &UR; Bruce Arena &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who directed the
Olympic (i.e. under-23) team two years ago in Atlanta and
reportedly is one of two finalists for the national job ...  &UR; Blaine
Wilson  &LR; will try to become the first man since  &UR; Kurt Thomas  &LR; in
1978 to win three straight US gymnastics titles in Indianapolis
this week. Top rivals will be four-time champ  &UR; John Roethlisberger
 &LR; and  &UR; Chainey Umphrey &LR; , &UR;  &LR; both Olympians, and 18-year-old  &UR; Jason
Gatson &LR; . Defending women's champion  &UR; Vanessa Atler  &LR; will be
challenged by  &UR; Kristen Maloney  &LR; and Olympians  &UR; Dominique
Moceanu &LR; , &UR; Dominique Dawes &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Kim Zmeskal &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who hasn't
competed in a major meet since the 1992 Barcelona Games ... Newest
inductees for the US Gymnastics Hall of Fame include the
Magnificent Seven (the 1996 Olympic women's champions),  &UR; Tim
Daggett  &LR; and  &UR; Mitch Gaylord  &LR; from the 1984 men's gold-medal team,
and  &UR; Julianne McNamara Ziele  &LR; and  &UR; Tracee Talavera  &LR; from the 1984
women's silver-medal team ... If the Goodwill Games add a winter
version for 2000, odds are the event will be held in Lake Placid,
which hasn't hosted anything that large since the 1980 Olympics.
Though the Adirondack hamlet has the skiing and skating facilities,
it needs a new bobsled/luge run, which it hopes the state will pay
for ... US Speedskating, which has lived on meager sponsorship
rations for years despite winning more Olympic medals than any
other winter sport, has hit the jackpot with Nike, which will
provide everything from skates to goggles plus cash through 2002.
The hook for Nike is the untapped crossover market with in-line
skating, which now provides most of the team's new talent ...
Though US boxers now have to compete in a regional qualifier for
the right to send a full Olympic team to Sydney (since the IOC is
limiting entries), at least they can count on home cookin'. Uncle
Sam will be hosting the tournament ... Final trials to pick the US
team for next month's world rowing championships in Cologne are
being held this weekend in Princeton. Up for grabs are the men's
coxed pair and four, lightweight pair and quad, and the women's
pair, lightweight pair, and lightweight quad. Boats from the US
national training centers are heavy favorites in every case ...
Slim pickings _ a silver medal by the men's coxed four _ for the US
in last weekend's world junior rowing championships in Austria. The
eights, both of which made the podium last year, ended up fourth
(men) and fifth (women, with Newton's  &UR; Liz Nelson  &LR; aboard) ... No
more free cyberlunch for the Lords of the Rings. IBM, which spent
more than $100 million on the Nagano Games and provided tech
services gratis, is calling it quits after Sydney because the IOC
wanted to up the ante for 2002 and beyond. That means that the Salt
Lake City organizers may have to cut deals with several providers.

STEAMBOAT ARABIA MUSEUM AN INCREDIBLE EXAMPLE OF SMALL-BUSINESS
SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The 1 millionth visitor to the Steamboat
Arabia Museum didn't elicit much media attention last month, but it
was an impressive milestone in the short history of one of Kansas
City's most incredible small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The millionth was a member of an Oklahoma family, mom and dad
and three children, but it wasn't as though 1 million different
people have toured the frontier shrine.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many tour tickets the Arabia has sold since its
opening in the City Market complex in November 1991. As for how
many individuals have been through the turnstile, it's hard to say
because Arabia has created so many superfans.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Ebert, for instance, has visited the Arabia 20 times, as
far as she can remember and the museum's guest book can determine.
Her love affair began one Sunday afternoon shortly after the Arabia
opened and her late husband was engrossed in pro football on the
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Her first look at the Arabia's collection of artifacts left her
``awestruck,'' she said, and ``the more I saw, the more enthralled
I became.'' Since then, a trip to the Arabia is usually high on the
to-do list when entertaining visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Obermann, who has been to Arabia eight times, says it gives
him a tremendous sense of pride in being able to show visitors how
``people in our community have been able to put something like this
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about everything Kansas City has to offer _ and
there's a lot _ the museum is one of the crown jewels,'' Obermann
says.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-towners find the Arabia on their own, too. While
interviewing members of the Arabia's founding family recently in
the museum's food court, a family from Buffalo, N.Y., came by the
table. Their enthusiasm palpable, they wanted to thank to those who
``put it together.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's history is well known by now. The Hawley family of
Independence got interested in salvaging a steamboat that foundered
in 1856 while plying the Missouri River near Kansas City. Family
and friends spent the winter of 1988-89 going 50 feet into a farm
field that was once river channel to dig out the Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo trove is said to be the greatest aggregation of
frontier-era artifacts ever brought together in one place. What
began as an adventure has long since been transformed into highly
successful business as well as a leading Kansas City tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of adventure hasn't died, though. Father Bob Hawley
and sons Dave and Greg still talk seriously of going into the earth
again to retrieve another 19th century steamboat. Unlike the
Arabia, core samples indicate the one they've got their eye on
still has a mostly salvageable upper structure.
</P>
<P>
   That's down the road, if ever, though. In the here and now, they
build on their museum's growing popularity. They not only have a
website, but also are participating in Internet history-teaching
initiatives focusing on frontier America.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most amazing thing about this business is that
despite its ardent embrace by its tens of thousands of local fans,
that enthusiasm hasn't translated into any business community
recognition worth mentioning.
</P>
<P>
   It has never, for instance, been so much as a contender for the
annual Small Business of the Year award. Given the Arabia's immense
hometown popularity and track record as a leading Kansas City
enterprise, this is curious indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, maybe next year.

FREE HOUSE COMES OF AGE, BEATING A TOP FIELD IN PACIFIC  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY PRIVMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ Free House was the overlooked horse in last
year's Triple Crown races, when the glory belonged to Silver Charm
and Touch Gold. But Saturday at Del Mar Race Track, Free House
proved that he had grown up from a good 3-year-old to a sensational
4-year-old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making his second start of the year, and facing a top group of
older horses _ including Touch Gold, last year's winner of the
Belmont Stakes _ Free House ran away to an authoritative,
four-length victory in the &QC; $1million Pacific Classic, the
championship race of the meet here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, last year's winner of this race, tried to match
strides with Free House on the final turn but proved no match for
him in the stretch and had to settle for second. Pacificbounty
rallied for third.
</P>
<P>
   Touch Gold, sent off as the 3-2 second choice, never fired and
finished fifth. Puerto Madero, who was coupled in the wagering with
Gentlemen, was sixth. The entry, trained by Richard Mandella, was
sent off as the favorite at 6-5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm missed the race because he is still recovering from
his poor last-place finish in the San Diego Handicap three weeks
ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free House was timed in 2:00 1/5 for a mile and one quarter on
the fast main track. He paid $9 for a $2 wager to win and earned
$600,000 for his owners, Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victory was seen by McCaffery and Free House's trainer, Paco
Gonzalez, as vindication for their colt, who has been under a cloud
of suspicion since a victory in last month's Bel Air Handicap at
Hollywood Park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the California Horse Racing Board's official
testing laboratory, Truesdail Laboratories of Tustin, Calif., Free
House tested positive for the prohibited bronchodilator Clenbuterol
after the Bel Air. Clenbuterol is approved for training, but not
for competition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under state rules, however, a horse must have a positive test
for a prohibited drug confirmed by a second, independent lab. That
second test has yet to be conducted. Gonzalez, who has a clean
reputation, maintains that he has never given the drug to Free
House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes up for all we've been through the past few weeks,''
McCaffery said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free House got a perfect trip under the jockey Chris McCarron.
The hopeless long shot Ayrton S made a dash for the lead and set a
solid pace of 22 4/5 seconds for the quarter-mile and 46 seconds
for the half-mile. Another long shot, Albaha, was right on his
heels, with Gentlemen and Free House next. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the field moved to the far turn, the two long shots faded as
Gentlemen and Free House roared past them.
</P>
<P>
   Touch Gold, who had been fifth, was asked for his best by his
rider, Pat Day, but he was empty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen led Free House by a half-length with a quarter-mile
remaining, after a mile in 1:34 4/5, but Free House moved past him
powerfully after turning into the lane and drew away while ducking
out and then back in the final furlong. He was well clear of
Gentlemen while doing the cha-cha. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCaffery and Toffan are the breeders and owners of Free House,
an obscurely bred colt by Smokester out of the mare Fountain Lake,
by Vigors.
</P>
<P>
   Free House has outrun his pedigree from the start. He won last
year's Santa Anita Derby, then distinguished himself in the Triple
Crown by finishing second in the Preakness Stakes and third in both
the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But after a poor performance in last fall's Super Derby, Free
House was given a lengthy vacation. He was off for nine and a half
months before returning for his victory in the Bel Air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He just needed time,'' Gonzalez said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free House, who was bred in California, has now won 7 of 17
starts and $2,181,371.

DE SWARDT FINALLY BREAKS AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY _ Both players had expected that their match might go
the full three sets. And the semifinal started out true to form,
with just one service break in each of the first two sets.
</P>
<P>
   But Mariaan de Swardt got the break she needed in the third set,
and it propelled the unseeded 27-year-old from South Africa to
Sunday's final of the Boston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   De Swardt was ahead of Lisa Raymond in games, 6-5, and had just
hit a winning forehand up the line to create the break point, at
30-40.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, a 27-year-old from Wayne, Pa., then appeared to survive
by hammering a serve that skipped off the baseline. However, it was
ruled out by the baseline umpire, and even though chair umpire
Stephanie Reidy overruled, that only gave Raymond back her first
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond then proceeded to double-fault, and de Swardt was a 4-6,
6-4, 7-5 winner _ and a WTA Tour event finalist for the first time
in 10 years as a pro. She will meet another first-time finalist,
Barbara Schett, at Babson College at 2 p.m., $27,000 going to the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you make a final in singles or doubles, it means
you're playing well,'' said de Swardt, who won the singles title on
the International Tennis Federation's satellite circuit two weeks
ago in Salt Lake City. ``I've been playing for 10 years, but with a
couple of years off due to injury, I don't see myself as a pro for
10 years. It's been more like five or six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond's plan was to stay away from de Swardt's forehand.
``It's like playing a man,'' Raymond, the third seed, said. ``It's
a big forehand. Her whole game is to set up her forehand. She was
hitting (them) to allow her to get to the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond did not have any complaints about the baseline call that
was overruled. Especially after she sealed her own fate by faulting
on her next serve. ``I knew I was going to be in trouble,'' Raymond
said. ``She put a lot of pressure on my second serve. If she's
going to crank that forehand, it's probably going to be a winner or
it's going to be a very tough shot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond said the two-hour-12-minute match kept her off balance.
``It was a crazy match; we had very few rallies,'' she said. ``I
had no rhythm in the whole match. It was a long match, but there
weren't long points. She either misses or hits a winner. When she's
on, the ball's going in, and when she's off, they rarely went in _
they usually hit the fence. Whoever took the opportunity and
consolidated them, they were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   De Swardt concentrated on Raymond's serve in that final game,
after having difficulty with it earlier in the match. ``I wanted to
be aggressive and, hopefully, to see a second serve,'' de Swardt
said. ``I had to be aggressive and make the play. I was trying to
stay with her and, when I had an opportunity, to use it to my
advantage. I stayed with her. I could have easily lost in straight
sets.''
</P>
<P>
   De Swardt changed strategy midway through, opting to go to the
net whenever possible. ``Lisa was putting pressure on me, and I
looked at the percentage that she was winning at by coming to the
net _ she was taking a lot of points,'' said de Swardt, who has
elevated her rank to 50th from the low 300s last spring. ``If I
didn't put pressure on her, I was going to be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   De Swardt enters Sunday's final feeling good, with no problems
with the right shoulder that caused her to take time away from the
tour at the conclusion of the 1996 season. ``This is the best I've
felt in 10 years,'' she said. ``I'm, like, wired. The older I get,
the better I feel.''

`EX-GAY' MINISTRIES INTENSIFY DEBATE OVER SEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ About two decades ago, Andy Comiskey,
transfixed by the gospel of Jesus Christ, peered into his heart and
came to a conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   He no longer wanted to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   So he prayed, and he delved deep into his past, into his psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Now 40, married for 16 years and with four children, Comiskey,
of California, is the ``ex-gay'' leader of Desert Stream, a
national Christian ministry with 200 church-affiliated groups in
cities including Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Today at Metro Christian Fellowship in Grandview, Comiskey and
nearly 500 people dealing with issues of what Comiskey calls sexual
``brokenness,'' including gays, lesbians, transsexuals, adulterers
and Internet porn addicts, will conclude a three-day seminar on
how, through God's grace, they can all find healing and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   And how gays and lesbians can go straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biblically,'' said Comiskey in an interview, ``you are
hard-pressed to find justification for a homosexual lifestyle. I
don't believe that was God's intention for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 13, Exodus International, a Seattle-based network of 90
``ex-gay'' ministries, including Desert Stream, began taking out
full-page ads in national and regional newspapers: The New York
Times, The Washington Post, USA Today and others. In the ads,
``ex-gay'' men and women declare the happiness they've found in
heterosexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Exodus leaders say the message is one of hope. But because the
ads are paid for by more than a dozen groups, including the
conservative Family Research Council and the Christian Coalition,
gay-advocacy groups declare that the ads are designed to poison
dialogue on issues such as gay marriage, gays in the military and
discrimination in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about politics, pure and simple,'' said Wayne Besen,
spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading national
gay-rights organization based in Washington. ``It's about denying
gay people equal rights.''
</P>
<P>
   This month a coalition of gay-rights groups retaliated with its
own ads. One, featuring a smiling, gay African-American, begins,
``I'm living proof that lesbian and gay Americans can be whole and
happy and worthy of all that this great country promises.'' Its tag
line: ``If you really love someone, you'll fight for their right to
live with dignity and fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davies, 34, the ``ex-gay'' North American director of Exodus
International, said the group's goal is to alter the dialogue on
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose,'' he said, ``is to get an alternative viewpoint
on homosexuality out to the American people. We feel like the
discussion of homosexuality has become one-sided in our society. It
is now assumed by a lot of people that homosexuality is so inborn
that it cannot be changed. We are here to challenge that point of
view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a political organization....But I think it is
inevitable that our viewpoint will be included in those discussions
in every way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certain that any such discussion would prove confounding.
Although many scientists suspect that genetics has much to do with
homosexuality, the relative roles of nature and nurture are far
from clear.
</P>
<P>
   Most such ministries, like the 200 Living Waters church programs
supported by Comiskey's Desert Stream, work in similar ways.
</P>
<P>
   The first premise is that God, who is perfect, did not intend
men or women to be homosexual, which is morally wrong and sinful.
</P>
<P>
   The second premise is that homosexuality is not innate. Instead,
it is the unconscious result, in certain susceptible people, of any
manner of unresolved infant trauma, from physical or emotional
abuse to having a mother or father who was absent or emotionally
reclusive.
</P>
<P>
   The promise offered by these groups is that through a difficult
process of confessing one's sins, accepting God's grace and
ferreting out the ``true'' root of one's ``sexual brokenness,''
salvation and healing is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Boyer of Kansas City, 43, married for two years, took that
path years ago. He claims that because of problems in his family,
he became gay, a drug addict, a cross-dresser and a teen-age
prostitute on the streets in California, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he was 5, he said, he always had wanted to be a
girl, prayed for God to make him one, and believed that being male
was the source of all his unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   As he grew, he said, so did his ``homosexual compulsions.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyer, who is attending this week's workshop in Grandview, said,
he became ``ex-gay'' after repressed memories of his upbringing
were revealed through the Living Waters program, which also offered
him love, support and acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's intent for our lives is to restore us to be what he
intended us to be,'' said Boyer, who now coordinates a Living
Waters program in Kansas City, North. He said he no longer has
homosexual desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homosexual self, the gay self, is not the true self,'' he
said. ``It is false.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Exodus officials say that their ministries have
``touched'' more than 200,000 individuals, it keeps no reliable
success statistics. And tales of former ``ex-gays'' abound _ with
some becoming legend, such as the story of Michael Bussee and Gary
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Bussee and Cooper, two of Exodus International's founders, left
the program in 1979 after they fell in love _ with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groups like Desert Stream and others are all based on a lie.
The lie is that there is something wrong with being gay,'' said the
Rev. Paul Smith of Broadway Baptist Church in Kansas City, a
congregation that includes many gay and lesbian members.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous ministers, including Smith, say it is wrong for
``ex-gay'' groups to pose as ministries of Christian love and
acceptance, when the support they give is based not on true
acceptance, but on change.
</P>
<P>
   Although sexual conversion... MORE
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...acceptance, but on change.
</P>
<P>
   Although sexual conversion is still attempted by some
psychiatrists, the American Psychiatric Association removed
homosexuality from its list of mental disorders more than 25 years
ago. The American Psychological Association maintains that there is
no evidence that conversion therapy works.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the association says such therapy may do more harm than
good by condemning patients to guilt, loneliness and depression,
self-loathing, denial of sexuality, sham marriages and, in some
cases, suicide attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can compare it to anything, it's like the days when
teachers used to try to cure kids of being left-handed because the
left hand was the sign of the devil,'' said Randy Hite of Kansas
City. ``How preposterous is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Raised Southern Baptist in small-town Kansas, Hite, who is gay,
said that he suffered from intense conflict as a boy. While the
church taught him that homosexuality was dirty and evil, he also
knew his own desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advice I got was to pray to God and he'll change you,'' he
recalled. ``I tried all during high school, and it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for Hite's partner, Rick Fisher, who grew up in
New Jersey as the son of a Baptist minister. ``For years,'' Fisher
said, ``I struggled and agonized and prayed.'' Once, he said, he
even took part in an exorcism, ``to have all the demons cast out of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were done,'' Fisher said. ``I still had those sexual
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Hite and Fisher say, they found true spiritual and
emotional contentment in the same manner as countless other gays
and lesbians: not from attempts to be ``ex-gay,'' but by accepting
that they are gay.
</P>
<P>
   As Hite said, ``I see us as part of God's wonderful creation. It
is through my being gay that I have found the most loving God. I
was rejected by the world, and I have had to rely on God for
support. If it wasn't for me being gay, I would not know God as I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``ex-gay'' movement and its associated ministries have
without question intensified the debate within Christianity over
the nature of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason gays are suffering,'' said Smith of Broadway
Baptist Church, ``is because people keep trying to cure them. But
there is no cure for homosexuality, because they don't need to be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being gay is a gift from God just like being straight is a
gift from God.''

PGA BECOMING TOUR'S CROWN JEWEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; REDMOND, Wash. _ There is increasing sentiment, at least in
this corner, that professonal golf's two most captivating major
championships are not the Masters and US Open. True, the Masters
was a marvelous show this year, and the US Open was an encore for
Lee Janzen. But the atmosphere at Augusta National is enough to
turn off the average guy, and the US Open has become too stifling
in its rigidity.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the second world. The British Open, with its
wild weather at Royal Birkdale last month, was a marvelous event.
And the PGA of America scored a major coup by bringing its
championship to the Pacific Northwest at Sahalee CC. The club name
is derived from a Chinook phrase meaning ``high, heavenly ground,''
and the course was in immaculate condition, a cathedral amid the
pines.
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee CC sits on the eastern shores of Lake Sammamish on what
is known as the Sammamish Plateau. Five days of splendid weather
leading into the weekend have made this a golfing paradise.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the PGA Championship was contested in this part of
the country was 1946, when Ben Hogan won a 6-and-4 match-play
decision over Porky Oliver at Portland (Ore.) GC. The only other
time it was in Washington was 1944, when Bob Hamilton edged Byron
Nelson, 1-up, at Manito CC in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA of America decided several years ago to move its
championships to parts of the country that don't usually see
majors. They picked a gem in Sahalee CC, which may become part of
the rota.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural setting that the golf course sits in, with the
pines and the trees, is very unique and very beautiful,'' said Mark
O'Meara. ``I think all of the players who hadn't had an opportunity
to play Sahalee are very excited about what they've seen. The golf
course is in beautiful shape. The greens are as nice as you could
ever want to putt on. It's nice to be up in the Pacific
Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Championship has frequently suffered from an identity
crisis, even leading the PGA of America to move the 1971 event to
February in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., so it would be the first of
the majors. Jack Nicklaus won it that year, but it returned to
August the next year at Southern Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Annually, the PGA field is the best of the majors, and it
continues to provide the best theater. Who will forget the chip of
Stuart Appleby _ whose wife was killed by a car on a London street
after the British Open last month _ going in for birdie on the 18th
hole Friday? Appleby missed the cut, but he had that moment to
celebrate as the crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   It may be tough Sunday to top the performance of O'Meara at the
Masters and British Open, or Janzen at the US Open, but who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Just one year from Monday, US captain  &UR; Ben Crenshaw  &LR; will name
the final two members of the Ryder Cup team that will meet the
defending champion Europeans at The Country Club. Next month,
Crenshaw will meet with the European captain at the course in
Brookline, Mass., where he went to the quarterfinals of the US
Juniors in 1968. ``I've flown to Boston twice already and I expect
to be there twice in September,'' said Crenshaw. ``There's a myriad
of details, but it's fun. It's just really started. They've done a
wonderful job at Brookline. It couldn't be a prettier place to have
the matches. It means a lot to me personally and to those players
who played in the US Open in 1988. It's one of those places where
there's a special atmosphere. I don't know how you can conjure up a
better place as a venue.'' ... Crenshaw was asked about Nicklaus's
absence from the British Open and PGA Championship. ``Players of my
vintage will feel a void not watching Jack compete and playing
against him,'' said Crenshaw. ``It was a little sad that he's not
going to play and his string is broken. He's going to play again,
but not to have him around at a major is something I'm not used to
and I know a lot of people aren't. We've put our eyeballs on the
most efficient performer in the majors there probably will ever be.
He could break down a golf course and assess its weaknesses and
stick to a plan. That's very difficult to do over 72 holes. The
competition today prevents someone from getting anywhere close to
it. We were lucky to have seen it all this time.'' ...  &UR; Davis Love
 &LR; returned to Sahalee as defending champion and his friend, Seattle
native  &UR; Fred Couples &LR; , &UR;  &LR; returned to his roots. Couples had already
played 18 holes last Monday when Love approached him. ``I said,
`Come on. Go out on the course with me. Just play a couple of
holes,''' said Love. ``So we went out 1, 2, and 3 and came in 7, 8,
and 9. It was good because he showed me a little bit about the golf
course. He also showed me how excited he was to be playing here. If
I can't win, it sure would be great if Freddie plays well because
the tournament he has here has done a lot for charity in this
town.'' ... Janzen on the impact of his Isleworth neighbor,  &UR; Tiger
Woods &LR; : &UR;  &LR; ``It's probably influenced a lot of players since he came
out on tour,'' said Janzen. ``He's got great talent, and I think in
his mind he expects a lot of himself. I think he also thinks he can
do just about anything. I think this challenged the rest of us to
start thinking a little higher and setting higher goals. That's one
reason why the younger players won last year. Just playing with him
at Isleworth I've realized that I can be better than I was. Just
mentally. Just by desire alone. I think his desire is great. He
wants to be the greatest player who ever lived. When you see
somebody with those kind of aspirations, you think, `I certainly
can expect more of myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Paul Runyan &LR; , who won the PGA Championship twice and was the
first head professional at Sahalee CC in 1969, received the PGA of
America's Distinguished Service Award on the eve of the
championship. ``Certainly I'm indebted to golf for allowing me to
earn a better-than-average living under the most pleasant
circumstances known to mankind,'' said Runyan. ``I've traveled very
widely. I'm sure as an Arkansas farm kid I never would have had any
chance to approach the pleasant way of earning a livelihood that
I'm blessed to have with golf itself. I'm only an eighth grade
graduate in the public school system, but I feel that I'm a
reasonably well-educated person because of the wonderful people
that I've met and the close association with people that were
well-educated. So to that degree I think I'm maybe a 12th grade
student instead of an eighth grade student.'' ... The New England
Pro-Assistant championship was won by  &UR; Gary Young  &LR; and  &UR; Tom Gilbert
 &LR; of Pleasant Valley last Tuesday at Wachusett CC. Young and Gilbert
finished tied with  &UR; John Scheffler  &LR; and  &UR; Tim McLaughlin  &LR; of
Eastward Ho!, then won on the second hole of the playoff. Young had
won with former assistant  &UR; Scott Trethewey  &LR; two years ago ...  &UR; Kirk
Hanefeld  &LR; of Salem CC, who won the recent Rhode Island Open, has
pulled within 4 points of Woburn's  &UR; Paul Parajeckas  &LR; in the Wogan
Award standings for NEPGA Player of the Year ...  &UR; Tom Lehman &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
won the British Open two years ago but injured his shoulder while
cavorting with his children at an amusement park before this year's
tournament, said, ``I had an MRI done on my shoulder as soon as I
got back from the British Open. They immediately ruled surgery out.
I have had treatment this week, and it doesn't feel too bad right
now.'' ...  &UR; Steve Elkington &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who won the 1995 PGA in a playoff
with  &UR; Colin Montgomerie &LR;  at Riviera, &UR;  &LR; has had his problems, too.
``It's been a frustrating year healthwise,'' he said. ``I think I
would have been fine if I just had sinus problems. But I got
meningitis, which I had forgotten how hard that was to come back
from. I had it in 1986. I think I'm only now just getting over
it.'' ... The PGA of America said it will change its format for the
four-man Grand Slam of Golf from 36 holes of stroke play to match
play: two matches on Nov. 17, with the winners playing for the
title the next day at the Poipu Bay Resort GC in Hawaii. The winner
will earn $400,000. The winners of the four majors qualify, but
O'Meara has already won two. The first alternate, also based on
performance in the majors, was Woods as of Friday, and the second
alternate was  &UR; Jose Maria Olazabal &LR; . You also have to have won a
major to qualify ... Remember when dates were being shuffled
around, affecting the CVS Charity Classic at Pleasant Valley? Word
was the PGA Tour would set up shop in Seattle, at a new TPC at
Snowqualmie Ridge about 5 miles east of Sahalee. Organizers were
offered the same dates open to Pleasant Valley, which just happened
to be opposite the new NEC Invitational that will bring the members
of the last Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup teams to Akron, Ohio. So
the PGA Tour reportedly asked for a $2 million purse. With the
world's top players scheduled to be in Akron that week, nobody has
come forward with the $2 million in Seattle, even though the dates
were guaranteed. Sound familiar?

FORMER TEACHER CHARGED WITH STATUTORY RAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN HOFFMANN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 38-year-old former teacher was charged with
statutory rape Friday after she allegedly had sex with a
sixth-grade student from Raymore-Peculiar Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Amy M. Rodriguez of Greenwood was arraigned in Jackson County
Circuit Court on three counts of statutory rape. She pleaded not
guilty to all the charges and was released on $25,000 bond. A judge
ordered her to avoid contact with the 12-year-old boy and other
youths younger than 17.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Rodriguez faces a prison sentence of five years to
life on each count.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was a student in Rodriguez's class at Raymore-Peculiar
Middle School during the 1997-98 school year. The incidents
allegedly occurred in May and June at the teacher's home.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said Rodriguez voluntarily resigned several
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Angles, an attorney for Rodriguez, said he intends
to ``present an aggressive defense.'' He said he and his client are
``looking forward to our day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, the relationship began late in the
school year when Rodriguez told the boy that she needed to talk to
him and suggested that he spend the night at her house.
</P>
<P>
   She told him to tell his mother that he was spending the night
with a friend from school, prosecutors said, and even called the
boy's house and pretended to be the friend's mother.
</P>
<P>
   On May 8, the student stayed after school and was driven by
Rodriguez to her home, the documents say. Rodriguez and the boy
talked for several hours, ordered a pizza and talked some more.
Investigators believe the teacher then showed the student around
her house, with the tour ending in the master bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   The documents allege that the teacher unfastened the boy's
pants, undressed him and herself, and then had intercourse with
him.
</P>
<P>
   On at least two other occasions, prosecutors said, the teacher
drove the boy to her home and had sex with him.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the boy accurately described the inside of
Rodriguez's home.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Rodriguez had lived there with her husband and
two children. A neighbor said the husband had moved out but
recently was seen at the house.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents say the student's mother became suspicious June
12 after the boy had told her he was going skating with friends.
When Rodriguez picked him up at his house, she identified herself
as the mother of a friend. But when she dropped the boy back home
later, she gave a different name and quickly left.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, according to court records, the mother
received a call from a woman who identified herself as Amy
Rodriguez and said she was the person who had dropped off her son
the night before. The teacher went to the boy's home, admitted she
had lied and said she had picked her son up only once.
</P>
<P>
   Her story did not match the boy's. He said Rodriguez had picked
him up more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents say the mother also found romantic notes,
including one that read: ``I can't wait to be with you forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said a handwriting expert determined that the
writing on the notes matched that of Rodriguez on other documents.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, reached Friday night at home, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Court records also allege that Rodriguez met in mid-June with
Terri Jamison, principal at the middle school, and told her that a
friendship other than teacher//student had developed with the boy
and that she had lied to the student's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle E. Boyles, assistant superintendent of the Raymore-Peculiar
School District, said he was unsure how long Rodriguez had taught
at the school or what subject she taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really have any direct involvement in this,'' he
said. ``As I understand it, this took place away from school during
nonschool hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Another district official said Rodriguez had been a substitute
teacher at the middle school but had gained ``teacher'' status
before she resigned.

TO VAUGHN FROM THE MOUTH OF A BABE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In conjunction with HBO, which is airing a Babe Ruth special
tonight at 8:01, the Red Sox celebrated ``Remember Babe Ruth Day''
at Fenway Park Saturday before playing the Minnesota Twins. Bambino
videos were shown on the big board and Ruth's daughter, Julia Ruth
Stevens, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Babe, who died 50 years ago Sunday, visited me in my sleep
Friday night, and asked me to deliver this message to Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Maurice,
</P>
<P>
   I see where things have been a bit rough for you around old
Fenway this year. I remember it well. You should have seen the
stuff that came down on my big head in my last year with the Sox in
1919.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, lemme tell ya, I hated leaving Boston. I loved the
city, the ballpark, and the fans. Most of all, I loved the kids.
There was nothing I wouldn't do for the kids of Boston. And they
loved me back. I know.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the Red Sox have never understood players like you
and me. They've never liked colorful guys with big appetites and
opinions. You think you felt bad when the Sox got rid of Clemens?
You'll never know how I felt when we dumped Carl Mays in the middle
of the 1919 season. Carl was The Franchise for us. He won the
clinch game of the 1918 World Series against the Cubs. I called him
``Bazookaman.'' But he couldn't get along with management and they
let him go to New York. Yeesh. GM Eddie Barrow and owner Harry
Frazee were such dolts. I called 'em ``the joint chiefs of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that a lot of my woes occurred off the field. I
crashed my motorcar into a Boston trolley one night. The flatfoots
put me in the clink, it made the papers, and all hell broke loose.
You'd have thought I killed somebody. When they found out I was
with a chick who wasn't my wife, it got even worse for me. Geez, if
we'd had a Foxy Lady to visit in those days, I could have avoided
all kinds of trouble. All we had was Scollay Square and I
practically owned the place.
</P>
<P>
   Sox management didn't trust me. That was the bottom line. They
asked me to submit to alcohol evaluation before the 1919 season.
What a joke. Can you imagine? I mean, there were nights when that
booze-measuring machine would have exploded if I blew into it, but
I never had a problem. Never missed a game. Never let the team
down. And they didn't ask anyone else on the club to agree to such
a clause.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the thing about my big gut. The Sox were always
on me about being out of shape but I told 'em I didn't look too fat
circling the bases after my tape-measure homers. Didn't matter.
Barrow, the dorky GM, was always talking about how Wally Schang was
a ``real baseball player who always keeps himself in shape.'' I
knew what that meant. It was Barrow's way of saying, ``Schang isn't
a fat slob like Ruth.'' I hear that's what they're doing when they
compare you to this whiz kid, Nomar.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about your situation, but the last straw was when
Frazee hired a private detective to follow me home to Sudbury at
night. It was pathetic. The poor guy wasn't much of a sleuth. I
knew he was trying to catch me going into a speakeasy, but I lost
him every time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the smear campaign was on. The Sox were floating
rumors that I was using illegal substances. That was pretty low. A
little bathtub gin never hurt anybody. I explained all this in an
exclusive interview with Steve Murton of the old Boston Record. All
the rest of the reporters got mad at me and Murton. Glenn Mordway
and those nitwits on sports talk radio were killing me, too.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, after all this came down, I told the Sox in the spring
of 1919 that the price was going to go up every day. And it did. I
kept crushing homers and by the end of the year I decided I wanted
$30,000 spread over two years. I told Frazee I wanted market value
and would not take any hometown discount. It made all the papers
and a lot of the fans didn't understand. I tried to explain that it
wasn't about the money. It was about respect. But it's hard for
fans to understand when you're talking about that kind of dough.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the fans were fickle. I hit 29 bombs in my last
season with the Sox, but they still booed me half the time. They
didn't like it when I held out for the big bucks or when I told the
papers that I wanted to play for the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball
team of the International League.
</P>
<P>
   You've no doubt noticed that the Sox haven't had much luck since
I left. People blame me, but I never cursed the team. It's just
been bad management. I hope you guys win everything this year. I
still have a soft spot for Boston. I still love the park and the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   And the kids. Think about them before you decide to leave, Mo.
If you love playing baseball, Boston's a tough town to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Yours truly,
</P>
<P>
   The Babe

`STEAMER' HEATING UP DESERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS There he is in a small studio at a small radio
station on a sweltering day, the old Los Angeles journalistic icon
talking about sports in a gentle and professional manner that has
become almost extinct in his trade.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Furillo is as passionate as ever about the topics he's
discussing, but it's all different for him now.
</P>
<P>
   He is far removed from the bright lights of his beloved Los
Angeles, but the advancing years and the low profile venue haven't
dimmed his fabled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love it here ... happy as I've ever been,'' says Bud Furillo,
and he joyfully resumes speaking into a microphone about Michael
Irvin and the Coliseum and USC football and the passing of Sam
Balter and various other subjects.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Bud Furillo was president of the Southern
California chapter of the Baseball Writers of America, and he had
Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. perform skits and
Nancy Wilson sing songs and Phil Silvers tell jokes as master of
ceremonies at the organization's big off-season dinner gathering.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Bud Furillo possessed the influence to
turn gambling bustouts like Jimmy Snyder into national figures
known as Jimmy the Greek.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Bud Furillo could phone Sinatra and Elvis
Presley and Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield and Mamie Van Doren
and a lot of other entertainment types any time he so pleased.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Bud Furillo was on a first-name basis with
gangsters like Sam Giancana, John Roselli, Joe Sica, Fred Sica and
Mickey Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Bud Furillo would show up at the Olympic
Auditorium at a big boxing show with an entourage that had more
members in it than Muhammad Ali's.
</P>
<P>
   But the spotlight no longer glares on Bud Furillo, who ranks
among the most colorful if not most talented journalists in Los
Angeles history.
</P>
<P>
   The frantic existence he once lived as a young reporter with the
Los Angeles Herald Express, and then as the sports editor of the
Los Angeles Herald Examiner, has now been replaced by relative
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe I'm going to be 73 on August 19?'' says
Furillo, shaking his head slowly during a break on his 4 to 6 p.m.
sports talk show he does daily here on KPSI (920 AM) with Steve
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   No, I can't.
</P>
<P>
   I've known Bud Furillo, a 1943 Bell High School graduate, since
he was in his early 40s, worked under him, lived near him in
Downey, endured his infamous tirades, partied with him, learned so
much of my newspapering from a man who had almost a mystical knack
for it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm one of his acolytes, as was the late Allan Malamud, as are
Bob Keisser, Steve Bisheff, Steve Harvey, Mitch Chortkoff, Larry
Stewart, Jack Disney, Richard Levin, Tom Singer, Jim Perry, John
Beyrooty, Lyle Spencer, sportscaster Steve Hartman and countless
others.
</P>
<P>
   When I first worked for him, I was a beginner in awe of Furillo,
who molded me and scolded me and inspired me with the toughest love
imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The column he then wrote for the Herald Examiner was called the
Steam Room, and it was one of the most popular in L.A. and there
was no one more powerful in the sportswriting fraternity in L.A.
when I arrived than Bud Furillo.
</P>
<P>
   When you went out with him to a restaurant in those days, you
would be treated like a celebrity and a steady stream of important
people always would stop by and pay their respects to him.
</P>
<P>
   To me, a wide-eyed youngster who grew up reading him, Bud
Furillo was a larger-than-life character, a charismatic person who
worked extremely hard at his craft and played just as hard when off
duty at the tavern he owned in Downey.
</P>
<P>
   He drank too much and gambled too much, but there was never a
dull moment with him, and there were plenty of laughs because he
forever was surrounded by an interesting cast of hangers-on that
always had an arm out for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   He was a sport who would pick up all tabs even at a time when he
was earning a modest income and and even at a time when he was a
single parent raising six kids.
</P>
<P>
   He could be mean-spirted when he was in one of his foul moods,
but he also was the most generous man I've ever known, giving
lavish wedding gifts to his writers and often loaning money to
people he knew couldn't pay him back.
</P>
<P>
   He was a strong-willed man who evoked ambivalent feelings among
both friends and foes, but everyone agreed that Bud Furillo had
style.
</P>
<P>
   He was known as The Steamer and he and Melvin Durslag put
together one of the great metropolitan sports sections at the
Herald Examiner, but he left the old paper in June of 1974 when he
got into a salary beef with the publisher, George Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   He would become an L.A. radio fixture throughout the 1970s and
1980s during tours at KABC and KIIS, and would spend a few years up
in Sacramento before settling down in this oasis 5{ years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He has had serious health problems, but he is a durable survivor
who has never come unraveled by adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to keep fighting in life,'' says Bud Furillo,
and he's still fighting his causes as he has been doing since the
legendary Herald Express editor, Aggie Underwood, pulled him off
the copy boy desk and made him a reporter in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   He would become a columnist for the Herald Express in 1958, but
he had been ghost-writing articles for people named George T.
Davis, John B. Old and Harry Culver ever since he joined the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old reporters liked to drink in those days, and when they
went on the road they sometimes failed to file their stories,''
relates Furillo. ``So I wrote a lot of stories under other guys'
names. I remember one time when Hary Culver was up in Berkeley
covering a showdown between Cal and UCLA. Both teams were
undefeated, and Cal won easily. Culver sent the score on the wires
with this aside, `Pick up details.' That was all he sent. So I
wrote the story for him. This was a fairly common newspaper
practice in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Furillo lives alone now in Palm Desert with his dog Rip, and
he seems quite content.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love what I'm doing,'' he says. ``And I don't plan to
retire soon. I'm having too much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started working with Bud Furillo, I really didn't
know that much about him,'' says Steve Kelly, his 39-year-old
partner who's a Rutgers graduate. ``If I knew then what I know now,
I'd have been tongue-tied. I never realized just how many people
Bud knows and just how famous he was until I started spending a lot
of time around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Furillo's juices still flow wildly when he's involved in a
big story.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find out who was responsible for the recent
firings of Bill Russell and Fred Claire, Furillo had on his program
Claire, Lasorda and Dodger president Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the conclusion that Tommy had nothing to do with the
firings and that it was Graziano who made the decisions,'' says
Furillo.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Furillo is an early riser these days because he goes to bed
early, a ritual he never followed when he was boss at the Herald
Examiner barking out orders to young sportswriters, and when his
presence often inspired terror among his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I miss the newspaper game,'' he says. ``But this radio
isn't too bad. I like what I'm doing. The people I work for are
very nice to me. I recently had what I thought was the best radio
show I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Furillo pauses with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm going to have a better one pretty soon,'' promises
Furillo, still fiercely competing in the dusk of a memorable
career.

Michigan Speedway maintains reputation despite tragedy
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BROOKLYN, Mich. _ More than 150,000 people will fill the stands at
Michigan Speedway for today's Pepsi 400, and three of those people
will be sitting in the exact seats where three spectators lost
their lives only three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those fluke deals,'' said John McDermont, a
41-year-old postal worker who made the trip from Cincinnati and is
sitting in the turn 4 area where the tragedy occurred. ``I'm not
worried about something like that happening, but I am glad they did
some things to protect the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedway officials added four feet to the top of the debris
fencing around the two-mile oval, along with additional cable for
reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has a great safety record,'' said Greg Penske,
director of the Michigan Speedway and the other tracks owned by his
father, Roger. ``Last month was the first incident we've had, but
it still was one too many. That's why we made these changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The additional fencing raises the height of the debris fence to
17 feet above the track surface and angles out toward the track,
providing an overhang to catch flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Speedway always has been considered one of the best and
safest tracks in America. It doesn't have the reputation of places
like Talladega and Darlington, where danger to the drivers lurks in
every turn of every lap.
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan is a wide, fast racing surface that has been the
site of some shocking crashes in its 29-year history. The one
accident that still is fresh in the minds of many was the
terrifying crash that almost killed Ernie Irvan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan lost control of the car, which slid into the turn 2 wall
at more than 170 mph. The car bounced off the wall, and little was
left of the body of the car when it finally came to a stop. Irvan
suffered a critical head injury and was in a coma. Doctors gave him
a 10 percent chance of survival, but he made a miraculous recovery
and returned to racing 14 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan was a rising star at the time of the crash. He was only 27
points behind Dale Earnhardt, who would go on to win his seventh
title.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan hasn't been that close to the top since the crash. He has
no recollection of the accident, saying his only memory is waking
up in the hospital days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my wife still gets tears in her eyes when a helicopter
flies in here,'' Irvan said. ``I can look at her and realize how
bad it must have been, but thankfully, I don't have any of those
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvan said he has no fear of racing at Michigan, but the feeling
isn't the same for some of the fans who were involved in the
tragedy at speedway three weeks ago. Gerald Bramer, who injured his
left arm when he used it to block the tire, said he has nightmares
about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream the tire is coming at me again,'' Bramer told the
Detroit News. ``I understand now what Vietnam vets go through. Not
a day goes by that I don't think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several drivers over the years have been left with bad memories
about Michigan Speedway, including Houston's A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   A crash in 1990 caused multiple fractures in his feet and legs,
leaving his racing career in doubt. Foyt endured a painful
rehabilitation process, often spending time at the Oilers' training
facility to work with strength coach Steve Watterson.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt came back to race again, but for a man in his mid-50s at
the time, it was the beginning of the end to a Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Bettenhausen's career came to an end at Michigan when he
lost an arm in a horrifying crash, and Rick Mears was seriously
burned in an accident at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some of these tragic incidents, Michigan is a race track
most drivers love because of its wide surface and ample passing
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the Winston Cup drivers are concerned that the new
air dam and spoiler rules NASCAR implemented this year (which gives
the cars less downforce) make the constant passing at Michigan a
dangerous proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit I'm pretty nervous about it,'' said Jeff Burton, who
won the Busch Grand National race Saturday at Michigan. ``We could
have incidents because of people getting their air (downforce on
the car) taken off. The key is to be able to drive deep into the
corner and not get loose. It's a great race track, but you have to
respect it.''

Strikeout pitchers a special blend of raw power, grace
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all its perfect, timeless symmetry and graceful
choreography, baseball is most compelling when it's a
brute-strength, mano-a-mano battle, lightning vs. thunder.
</P>
<P>
   What fans most love to see is a strikeout-minded pitcher
reaching far back and heaving lasers at a muscle-packed batsman
trying to return serve to the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   In this, baseball's comeback season (labor pains finally
subsiding, attendance rising), the nation is captivated by the
Daily Home Run Watch, the likes of which it hasn't seen since Roger
Maris and Mickey Mantle were alive and chasing the ghost of home
run deity Babe Ruth some 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But if the frequent rocket launches by Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa
and Ken Griffey Jr. weren't enough to draw media salutes _ the
cover of Time magazine _ Major League Baseball now brings its fans
another bonus: strikeout glory.
</P>
<P>
   The physics of the sport dictate that strikeouts proliferate
about the same time home runs do. Astros manager Larry Dierker
observes: ``The two things go together. Home run hitters swing
hard, and they strike out a lot _ except for Joe DiMaggio (who
never struck out more than 39 times in a season).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are trying to be home run hitters these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros shared, unwittingly, in one of baseball's special
moments, on May 6 in Wrigley Field. Kerry Wood, the precocious,
21-year-old Chicago Cub who is scheduled to pitch today in the
Astrodome, struck out 20 the last time he faced the Astros. He tied
the single-game major-league strikeout record set _ and later
matched _ by Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   This year the major leagues have two pitchers on pace for 300
strikeouts, Curt Schilling, a former Astro, and Randy Johnson, the
newly hired _ or rented _ gun who has won his first three starts
for the Astros, with two of them shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Strikeouts are trendy. National League games last season
averaged an all-time high 13.7 of them. The average increased every
year from 1992 (11.7) through '97, with this year's average down
only slightly, to 13.4.
</P>
<P>
   It's the batters who aren't obsessed with distance who are
difficult to overpower. San Diego's short-swinging Tony Gwynn is
the bane of the strikeout pitcher. He has fanned only once every 32
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a pitch that crosses the plate that he can't put
his bat on,'' Schilling says. ``He's the one guy with a runner on
third and less than two outs that I feel I wouldn't have much
chance to strike out.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are not many Gwynns. So any time a Wood or a Johnson
or a Schilling takes the mound, the possibility lurks for a
20-strikeout gem or a no-hitter. Which is why Johnson, who no-hit
Detroit in 1990, is accustomed to seeing crowds increase 10,000 and
more on nights he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a novelty going to a game when you can watch a
guy strike out a lot of people,'' Johnson says. ``Much like it's
fun to watch Mark McGwire have a chance to hit a home run farther
than you've ever seen.'' &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If Houston has any baseball tradition of note, it's that of
power arms.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition dates to Don Wilson (18 strikeouts in one game,
two no-hitters) in the 1960s. It continued with the imposing J.R.
Richard (two 300-strikeout seasons) in the '70s and Nolan Ryan (the
all-time strikeout king) and Mike Scott (300 K's, a Cy Young Award)
in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The torch of fire is carried now by Johnson and Billy Wagner,
baseball's hardest-throwing lefthanders of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans like that style of pitching, and I enjoy watching
that style of pitcher,'' says Ryan, who retired in 1993 with 5,174
strikeouts. ``I've always enjoyed watching Billy Wagner and the way
he's gone about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner last year had the highest strikeout average in
major-league history (minimum of 50 innings), with 14.4 for nine
innings. This year he's about the same, at 14.1.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who actually try to last nine innings, Wood and
Johnson are tops, averaging 12 per game, followed by Philadelphia's
Schilling at 10.2.
</P>
<P>
   The one asset virtually all strikeout artists share is 95
mph-plus heat. Dierker, who had 232 strikeouts in 1969, says one
thing hasn't changed since his playing days: ``The guys who strike
out a lot of people are the guys who throw hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wood, Johnson, Wagner, Schilling, (Robb) Nen _ they have
overpowering stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   All rely primarily on their fastball, though none to the extent
Schilling does. Scouts report more than 90 percent of his pitches
are fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling justifies his fastball fascination: ``There's never
been a pitcher in the history of the game who's been successful
without command of his fastball, whether it's John Tudor (known for
his off-speed style) or Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling figures the more he uses his fastball, the more
control he'll have of it. He throws only the hard, straight,
four-seamer _ ``because I want to know where the ball will be when
it crosses the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   He averages just 2.0 walks per nine innings. He deftly moves the
ball in and out, keeping the batter guessing where it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most pitchers have one corner they can work pretty well, but
they have a little trouble finding the other corner,'' Dierker
says. ``Schilling can hit both corners at will. He's proof that the
best pitch in baseball is a well controlled fastball.'' &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Schilling was MVP of the '93 NL Championship Series, but he
didn't blossom into a 300-strikeout ace until last year. He credits
his newfound power to shoulder surgery by Dr. Craig Morgan in
Wilmington, Del. Schilling claims the repair of a frayed labrum
made his arm stronger than it had ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made things different for me in my approach,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With his shoulder strengthened and his confidence raised, he
became much more aggressive, consciously pursuing stikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Most pitchers find it makes more sense to induce batters into
hitting bouncy grounders than to try to blow fastballs by them. But
the super-power throwers, such as Schilling and Johnson,
incorporate strikeouts into their strategy, depending on the game
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll start an at-bat thinking I want a strikeout,
but that's rare,'' Schilling says. ``I've noticed with Randy, he'll
get ahead in the count and then he'll air it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Johnson throws 93-95 much of the time. But he ratchets
it up 2-3 mph when a strikeout is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very different guy when he has two strikes,'' Schilling
says. ``I think I have somewhat the same philosophy. When I get
ahead in the count and find myself with two strikes, I will go for
the strikeout, because the strikeout eliminates any chance of the
runner reaching base.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he's ``not looking for a strikeout, but I just want
to put him away, whether it's a groundout or a flyout or a
strikeout. I don't want to lose him after all the hard work to put
him in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But yeah, I think my adrenaline, my intensity rises when I get
a guy 0-2, 1-2 and I have a chance to put him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tries to minimize the significance of strikeout numbers.
He doesn't want to violate the code that says winning is the only
thing that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about records; I don't try to strike people
out,'' he insists. ``In a couple of my games where I struck out 19,
I did try to strike out some people, and I couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strikeouts and home runs are things that just develop.'' &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, faced Ryan in his
prime and has seen Wood pitch twice and Johnson many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan had the best fastball of anyone I've seen,'' Garner says.
``When he was putting everything into it, he'd grunt, expel the air
out of his body, and the next thing you'd hear was `Pow,' in the
mitt. You wouldn't even see the ball, like you would on everyone
else. His was just a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Randy Johnson, because of his size, might be the most
intimidating of the pitchers I've known. You're never sure whether
he's going to let one up and in. He makes you want to back away
just a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his height (6-10),'' Garner says, ``Johnson's ball
powers down, and the angle makes it very tough to hit. A hitter
likes to get his eye on the same plane as the ball, to track it,
and you can't do that with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Johnson has such a good breaking ball that lefthanders
don't have a chance against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although an explosive fastball is essential for high strikeout
totals, a reliable second pitch is also needed, or else the power
pitcher will be consigned to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy throws real hard but doesn't spin the ball well,
whether it's a slider or a curve, he can be successful as a
reliever,'' Dierker says. ``But he can't get through the lineup
three times. After a certain number of pitches he starts losing
velocity, and with no other pitch to go to, he's in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this decade, if a pitcher threw hard, he would stay in
the minor leagues until he mastered an off-speed pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But now, if a Wagner or a Nen (who throws 99 mph for San
Francisco) shows command of a fastball but not a breaking pitch, he
becomes a closer. All teams want plenty of heat waiting on the back
burner, the theory being that a 98-mph fastball is especially
daunting to weary ninth-inning batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros traded Schilling (for Jason Grimsley, in case you've
forgotten) in 1992, mistakenly assuming his preoccupation with
power precluded him from being a successful starter.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't realize Schilling's extraordinary control would
extend his velocity. He needed only 94 pitches for a three-hit
shutout last week in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling throws a sharply diving split-finger pitch, but he
uses it only once or twice an inning _ usually to fetch a third
strike on the unsuspecting batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I throw it right,'' he says, ``it has the same rotation
as my four-seam fastball. It's very hard for the batter to pick it
up early.'' &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Ryan may have been the hardest-throwing pitcher ever _ radar
clocked him at 105 in his prime. But he rarely won without command
of his curveball.
</P>
<P>
   Wood throws harder than any other starter in baseball _ 97-100
mph as the ball leaves his hand. But Garner notes that Wood also
``has a very good breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wood, as with many young power pitchers, the issue is
control. ``If he has good control,'' Dierker says, ``you're not
gonna hit him. If he doesn't have control, he's gonna struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who throw 95-plus are going to have a little trouble
controlling their fastball,'' Dierker says. ``The ball is moving so
fast, spinning so fast, it's hard to keep it on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Schilling had control even as a teen-ager, Ryan and
Johnson spent years searching for it. Once they gained command of
the heater, they were able to remain in games long enough to build
their impressive strikeout numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And whether they admit it or not, these power pitchers enjoy
their strikeouts as much as the fans who cheer them on.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson often pumps his fist to register pleasure when he
strikes out a batter. Clemens, who was born in Katy, has won 227
games and claims to value wins above strikeouts, but he gave his
four children names beginning with ``K'' and not ``W.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 31, is a student of baseball history and a
memorabilia collector, and he doesn't mind saying he'd like to
leave his mark in the strikeout records.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it got close to 300, yeah, I was nervous and it was
something I wanted badly,'' he says. ``After that, I wanted the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished last season with 319 strikeouts. The major-league
record (post-1900) is Ryan's 383, set in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   With teams using five-man rotations instead of four, as they did
in the 1970s, it will be difficult for Schilling or future pitchers
to acquire enough innings to challenge Ryan's record.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at the trends _ more home runs, more swinging from
the heels _ it's not out of the question that strikeout records _
along with home run records _ will be broken. &QL;

Hard-throwing relievers often save the day with a `K'
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARA LaBRIE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Astros closer Billy Wagner is one of the best strikeout artists
among relief pitchers, averaging a major-league record 14.4
strikeouts per nine innings last season, a number he has almost
matched so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Wagner doesn't enter the game with K's on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happens,'' Wagner said. ``I never think, `I'm going to
strike this guy out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just thinking, `Three outs before they score.' I don't
go out there with the intention of striking someone out. It just
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros catcher Brad Ausmus is more of a pragmatist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 98-mile-an-hour fastball,'' Ausmus said of Wagner's
proclivity for striking out a lot of batters. ``When you throw that
hard the hitter really has to get his hands moving to hit the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   A fastball in the high-90s followed by a slider in the high 80s
confuses hitters, forces them to commit to a pitch and makes them
swing and miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's (a hitter) moving his hands to hit a 98-mile-an-hour
fastball and then you throw an 88-mph slider, you're way out in
front of it and tend to swing and miss again,'' Ausmus said. ``It's
very difficult to concentrate against guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Randy Johnson, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   At first thought, it would be difficult to equate the Astros'
newest sensation, who stands 6 feet 10, with the 5-11 Wagner. Yet
Brewers manager Phil Garner sees that the two lefthanders have the
same weapon in their arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What most hitters fear most is movement on the fastball,''
Garner said. ``The interesting thing about lefthanders is they're
extremely tough because their ball moves more. It's harder to pick
up a lefthanded ball that powers away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson towers more than 7 feet on the mound, so his pitches
arrive on a different plane than do those of other pitchers. Though
almost a foot shorter than Johnson, Wagner has managed to create
the same movement, forcing batters to level the playing field with
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your eyes have to track it rather than using depth
perception,'' Garner said. ``That tells you how good Wagner is. On
a shorter plane, it's easier to pick the ball up. But he's got so
much movement on the ball it's difficult to hit it. That's a
testament to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's reasoning behind his success isn't as technical.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a little lucky,'' Wagner said with a shrug of the
shoulders. ``I'm effectively wild. They swing at a lot of pitches
that they probably shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wagner isn't the only relief pitcher who commands respect
from hitters. The formula for other successful relievers remains
the same: speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have an explosive fastball,'' Astros infielder Sean
Berry said. ``Everything feeds off the fastball. You've got to have
more than one pitch, of course. Trevor Hoffman has a changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Hoffman leads the National League in saves with 39.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a guy who throws 99 miles an hour and has a great
changeup. That's a strikeout pitch,'' Ausmus said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Myers, who joined the Padres Aug. 7 after recording 28
saves with the Blue Jays, has an out pitch of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most good closers do have a strikeout pitch,'' Garner said.
``Randy Myers has come up with something _ it's not a fastball,
it's not a spitball, but it's something that hitters don't pick
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and Myers aren't the only strikeout relief pitchers who
come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robb Nen (who has 30 saves with the Giants) what about that
guy?'' Berry said. ``He's probably the most prolific strikeout
relief pitcher in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But has he ever sent Berry back to the bench?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's struck out everybody before,'' Berry said,
shaking his head. ``He's fun to hit off of, but it's feast or
famine.'' &QL;

<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ In the deadliest paramilitary attack ever in
Northern Ireland, a car bomb killed 26 people on Saturday and
injured more than 100, including pregnant women and infants, in the
town of Omagh, 55 miles west of Belfast, the capital of the British
province.
</P>
<P>
   The blast raised fears for the survival of the Northern Ireland
peace agreement between the majority Protestants and minority Roman
Catholics, as the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic
watched scenes of spilled blood and destruction on the evening
television news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was carnage,'' said Nigel O'Kane, whose pub is a few
hundred yards from the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   It happened at about 3 p.m., a half hour after the bombers made
an apparently misleading phone call to a newspaper warning that a
bomb would be detonated.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports that a Roman Catholic splinter
group calling itself the Real IRA had claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night in Belfast, Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn
Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, denounced the
attack. Normally, Adams, who is a member of the new Northern
Ireland Assembly, denounces violence but declines to criticize
specific Catholic paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Irish National Television reported that the police at the scene
believed that the warning call was deliberately misleading in order
to maximize the number of victims.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said the terrorists had given a
``totally inaccurate warning'' so as to kill as many people as
possible. Virtually no one in Ireland believed that the misleading
warning was a simple mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The caller, giving a code name recognized as one used by the
Irish Republican Army, according to the police, said the bomb would
go off near the court house. The police moved crowds of shoppers
several hundred yards away from the court house, but the bomb
exploded at the spot where the shoppers had been moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's ever happened in this town in such a long time,''
O'Kane said, adding: ``There are a lot of people in tears,
panicking, looking for their loved ones. They don't know if they're
dead or injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the injured were flown in helicopters to hospitals
elsewhere in the province. Local hospitals called for blood donors
and volunteer doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Several shops were devastated, and the streets one-half mile
from the center of town were covered with rubble.
</P>
<P>
   British soldiers, the police, firefighters and paramedics
searched for survivors and more dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is blood everywhere,'' said Ken Maginnis, a member of
the British Parliament and a leader of the mainstream Protestant
Ulster Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was obvious that the bombers were a Catholic
Republican splinter group opposed to the peace effort that produced
an accord approved in May in referendums in the North and here in
the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Dublin to crack down on the group, the Real IRA,
which is believed to operate out of the Irish Republic, crossing
the border into the North for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army has been observing a cease-fire for 13
months, and the dissidents maintain that the peace agreement is a
sellout of republican goals, particularly the establishment of a
unified Ireland with the mostly Protestant north subsumed in the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of the Irish Republic said the blast
was ``the most horrific act in years, a tragic day.'' He said the
Irish Republic would seek ``to crush these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern added that the Irish government would ``ruthlessly
repress'' the terrorist group, which is believed to comprise about
100 Catholic dissidents splintered away from the main Irish
Republican Army. The splinter group is believed to have ties with a
political party, the 32-County Continuity Committees, which opposed
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain called the blast ``an
appalling attack of savagery and evil by people who are determined,
whatever the cost to innocent people, to wreck the prospects for
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II expressed shock at the bombing. She offered
``my heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, the moderate Catholic leader who is the principal
initiator of the peace effort, said the terrorists were ``trying to
destroy the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Paisley Jr., son of the hardline Protestant leader, said the
attack was the result of coddling of republicans by the British and
Irish governments, which have begun the early release of
paramilitary prisoners. He accused Dublin and London of creating
``an endless bloody violent circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Paddy McGann, a local official in Omagh, said the Protestants
and Catholics in the town had lived peaceably together, free of
terrorist attacks for years. He noted that the attacks, attributed
to Catholic dissidents, came on the Assumption of the Blessed
Virgin, an important feast day for Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope whoever did this say their prayers tonight,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton condemned the attack. Clinton
is scheduled to visit Northern Ireland on Sept. 3, and his
spokesman said the president had no plans to cancel the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I renew my pledge to stand with the people of Northern Ireland
against the perpetrators of violence; they will find no friends
here,'' Clinton said in a statement. ``On behalf of the American
people, I condemn this butchery.''
</P>
<P>
   The governments of Britain and the Irish Republic, sponsors of
the peace effort, have repeatedly stated that terrorism by
dissident groups would not destroy the effort, under which a new
Northern Ireland Assembly convened in June to work out a new
political structure that would give Northern minority Catholics
more power.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's attack could lead to retaliation by Protestant
paramilitaries, which in turn would put pressure on the IRA to end
its cease-fire and return the province to the sectarian warfare
that has killed more than 3,200 people since 1969.

Despite slump, Wood is heir to throne
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Kerry Wood pitched a one-hitter and struck out 20 Astros
on May 6 in what some people feel was the most dominating game in
the history of baseball, he was hailed as the latest in a long line
of Texas flamethrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when the Chicago Cubs rookie takes the mound in the
Astrodome for his first professional start in his home state, he
will be trying to halt a flameout.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wood has an 11-6 record and 193 strikeouts in 138 innings
in his rookie season, he has hit a wall of late. In his last two
starts, Wood has lasted only 10 innings and allowed 14 hits and 12
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Those starts came after Cubs manager Jim Riggleman mentioned he
thought that Wood might be suffering a dead arm, a malady that
young pitchers sometimes face as the season grinds on. Obviously,
there is nothing seriously wrong with Wood _ his fastball was
clocked at 97 mph in his last start against San Francisco _ but the
rookie admits he's in uncharted waters as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Wood pitched a combined 151 in Class AA and Class
AAA, the most he had worked as a professional. In mid-August,
minor-league pitchers are thinking more about the end of the season
in early September than a race for a division title or wild-card
berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 10 starts left this year. Last year at this time, I
might have two or three left,'' said Wood. ``So we're cutting back
a little bit (on throwing) in between starts, taking it a little
easy and see how that works. We're seeing how I recover from the
start before and see how my arm reacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're up four, five runs going into the seventh, I might
not go out there this late in the season. In the home stretch, I
want to be able to reach back. I think it's important to do it
(taper off) now rather than not have enough left in the stretch. I
want to be able to turn it up a notch a little later on. Every game
is going to count. I'd rather miss an inning or two now and maybe
even a start rather than not have enough left at the end of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs clearly understand how valuable a property Wood is. At
21, Wood is on track to become the next dominant strikeout pitcher
from Texas. Nolan Ryan passed the baton to Roger Clemens, and
though Wood is only in his first season in the majors, he already
is drawing comparisons to those two overpowering pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are caught in a tight situation. They need Wood to
continue his rookie success in order to stay alive in the
postseason chase, but they also want to carefully monitor the
status of his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never has pitched more than 150 innings,'' said Chicago
pitching coach Phil Regan. ``We don't know how he's going to react
once he hits that mark. He's going to pitch a month longer than he
ever has, going into September _ and maybe longer.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wood was hit hard for the second straight time last week
at San Francisco, Giants second baseman Jeff Kent explained what he
thought was happening to Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not throwing with Nolan Ryan speed, you'll be able to
hit the fastball,'' said Kent, who hit a home run off Wood. ``I'd
hate to see Kerry Wood on a good day because it'd be a struggle to
hit that slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hung a lot of pitches and wasn't throwing them consistently
for strikes, so we were able to sit on fastballs. It showed me he's
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood acknowledged that he is still learning what he needs to do
to be successful on days when he doesn't have his sharp-breaking
slider or overpowering fastball. All young pitchers _ even those
with wicked stuff like Wood _ must figure out how to get by when
everything isn't clicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that I've learned this year, especially in
my last two starts or so, is that when you don't have your great
stuff you still have to go out there and compete,'' said Wood.
``You have to find a way. Every pitcher in the league has days
where they go out without their best stuff. You've got to learn how
to pitch and get through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days, you're going to be successful, and other times
you're not going to last very long. You realize that's part of
baseball; you're not going to win every game. You're going to get
beat. You're going to have days where you can't throw a strike and
you're going to have days where you throw nothing but strikes.
That's part of it. You just have to grasp that concept.''
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who saw Wood's performance in May against the Astros,
the very idea that he could give up 12 runs to Arizona and San
Francisco in his last two starts is mind-boggling. Wood overpowered
the NL's top-scoring team in a way that may never have been
duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed only a scratch single to Ricky Gutierrez in the third
inning _ a ball that Cubs third baseman Kevin Orie later said
should have been ruled an error _ and struck out a record-tying 20
batters, including seven straight during a stretch in the final
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That particular game might be the most dominant game ever
thrown in the history of major-league baseball,'' said Cubs
president Andy MacPhail. ``It could have been a no-hitter, and he
had 20 strikeouts. There have been one-hitters and no-hitters, and
there have been 20-strikeout games. But never in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, you're talking about one of the premier offensive teams
in the league. In the beginning, you were just kind of enthusiastic
and into it. But by the end of it, with the crowd roaring, you were
fortunate to have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   With that start, Wood went from being a highly touted prospect
scarcely known outside of Chicago _ he was selected fourth overall
out of Grand Prairie High School in the 1995 draft _ to a national
story. Despite having to relive and recount that game in May
against the Astros numerous times, he cannot yet explain why it all
seemed so easy that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine having better stuff than that,'' said Wood.
``That's the one time where you go out there with the best stuff of
your career. A lot of things have to happen. The umpire (Jerry
Means) was consistent with his calls, and I was able to let it
loose and hit the spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw the fastball, the breaking balls; I kept with it. It
seemed like every righthanded hitter, I had the same combination _
fastball, fastball, slider. What can I say? It was one of those
days.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Wood has lived up to the bloated expectations
that were thrust upon him after May 6. MacPhail seems just as
impressed with Wood's ability to handle the pressure of being this
summer's phenom as his talents on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations right now are very high,'' said MacPhail.
``My feeling is that if anybody can handle it, he can do it. What
impresses me most about Kerry is that down deep, he is really a
fierce competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman said: ``He's gotten the respect of his teammates. At
the same time, this is a veteran team that has helped guide him
along and try not to put too much on him. The press and talk radio
are always talking about him. He goes out there now and strikes out
six in six innings or eight in seven innings, and it's like 'Why
didn't you do more?'''
</P>
<P>
   Wood seems to understand the legacy of being a power pitcher. As
a teen-ager in the Dallas area, he watched Ryan close his career
with the Texas Rangers. Wood was at Arlington Stadium when Ryan
pitched his seventh no-hitter in 1990. Wood's father, Garry, told
the Chicago Tribune this summer that, ``I thought Nolan Ryan was
the best pitcher I'd ever seen. So we tried to emulate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he didn't ask for the No. 34 that Ryan wore during his
career when he reported to the Cubs. Nor did he balk when he was
assigned that number during his first spring training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really a nut for him like everyone's making out,''
Wood said about Ryan. ``I watched him, but I didn't have to watch
every start he made. I watched him if I was flipping through and
the game was on, sure, I didn't change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great career, and he'll be remembered in baseball
forever. I don't even have a full season, so it's kind of pointless
to even think about a comparison at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ryan, Wood is aware that the effectiveness of his breaking
ball will determine whether or not he has a dominant game. Ryan was
only as good as his curve; Wood relies on a hard-breaking slider
and a curve that catcher Scott Servais, the former Astro, says is
as good as ex-teammate Darryl Kile's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breaking ball determines whether you're going to be out
there for two innings or you're going to be out there for eight,''
said Wood. ``Last year (in the minors), that's why I struggled so
much. I wasn't getting my breaking ball over, and I was getting
knocked out early. Regardless of how hard you throw, even if you're
out there throwing 120 mph, they'll time you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be OK the first time through, but after that they'll
time it and you'll get beat. The breaking ball and off-speed stuff
makes your fastball that much more effective. My strikeout pitch
this year has been my slider. You can also use the fastball to set
them up. It can work both ways if you have an effective breaking
ball. You want to keep them off balance and keep them guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Servais, a seven-year veteran who is not prone to exaggeration,
says that Wood is ``the best pitcher I've ever caught, and I caught
some good ones in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's legit,'' said Servais. ``His curve is probably as good as
Darryl Kile's, just not as consistent yet. But Darryl wasn't
consistent, either, for a long time. His fastball is consistently
95, 96 (mph) and when the big boys come up, the top two or three
hitters on every team, he has a tendency to throw it a couple miles
an hour faster. It's a Nolan-like fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   The key for Wood the rest of this season, says Servais, is to
disregard the high expectations and trust his overpowering stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's struggled a little bit the last two weeks, and it's a
combination of a couple things,'' said Servais. ``Part of it is
that the expectations are so high every time he goes out. That's
tough. He's 21 years old and people expect him to strike out 20
every time and win every time. It's like, `Oh, Wood's pitching
today, the Cubs are going to win.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few little mechanical adjustments he needs to make
that he's aware of. And a lot of people are concerned about the
fact that he's never gone through this long of a season before.
You're not going to know how you do until you go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his recent downturn, Wood says he has been able to enjoy
his rookie season. The pressure of having been so close to pitching
perfection in his fifth start in the majors isn't taking away from
a wondrous summer in which he turned 21 and had the world by the
tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a blast,'' said Wood. ``This is a childhood dream
that I get to live out every day. I'm having a great time.
Everything that comes along with it is just fine.'' &QL;

Undisputed `K' king Ryan helped fine-tune Johnson
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Power pitchers stick together. Even when they're on competing
teams.
</P>
<P>
   When Nolan Ryan, the king of K's, was a Texas Ranger in 1992, he
felt empathy for Randy Johnson, who was with the Seattle Mariners,
rivals in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a taller, lefthanded version of the Ryan Express _
the strikeout machine who lasted 27 years in the major leagues and
produced a record seven no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson could throw 98 mph, his performance during the
first four years of his big-league career didn't match his ability.
He had thrown a no-hitter against Detroit in 1990, but by the end
of the '92 season his lifetime won-lost record was a slack 49-48.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew some of the frustration he was experiencing,'' Ryan
says. ``I went through the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Power pitchers often have difficulty developing the fluid
mechanics that allow them to control the fire they throw.
</P>
<P>
   And as Ryan points out, ``When you're real tall like Randy
(6-10), the mechanics are a little more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In the twilight of one of the greatest careers in baseball
history, Ryan felt he might be able to help Johnson, who now
pitches for the Astros. So after the '92 season, Ryan and Tom
House, the Rangers' pitching coach at the time, offered to meet
with Johnson and discuss his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking to fine-tune his mechanics,'' Ryan says. ``I
don't think I helped him much, but at least I was someone he could
talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson insists the advice he accepted from Ryan was a key
to his breakthrough year of 1993, when he went 19-8 with a 3.24 ERA
and 308 strikeouts. Most significantly, he reduced his walks to 99
_ down from 144 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan means a great deal to my success,'' Johnson says.
``There were some flaws in my mechanics that he helped me work on.
Being consistent with my mechanics is very important to having
success out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's important to try to help other pitchers on other
teams, because Nolan took the time to help me. It was one of the
things that helped get me over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   As brilliantly as Johnson has pitched over the past six years
(87 wins, 30 losses), he knows he's no threat to the legacy of
Ryan, who has retired to Alvin and a life of ranching, banking,
owning a minor-league baseball team (in Austin) and serving on the
state's Parks &AMP; Wildlife Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 34, would need more than 3,000 strikeouts to match
Ryan's career record of 5,714.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when Ryan sat a few feet behind home plate in the
Astrodome, Johnson last Wednesday reached double-digit strikeouts
for the 97th time. He tied Hall of Fame lefthander Sandy Koufax for
second place in that category.
</P>
<P>
   But second place is the best he hopes to attain, because No. 1
is Ryan, with 215 and awaiting his own certain induction into
Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've got a hundred-some-odd to go,'' Johnson said,
grinning. ``I think that's a safe record that Nolan has.''

   Today, when the Chicago Cubs rookie takes the mound in the
Astrodome for his first professional start in his home state, he

</P>
<P>
   Though Wood has an 11-6 record and 193 strikeouts in 138 innings
in his rookie season, he has hit a wall of late. In his last two
starts, Wood has lasted only 10 innings and allowed 14 hits and 12

   For the most part, Wood has lived up to the bloated expectations
that were thrust upon him after May 6. MacPhail seems just as
impressed with Wood's ability to handle the pressure of being this
summer's phenom as his talents on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectations right now are very high,'' said MacPhail.
``My feeling is that if anybody can handle it, he can do it. What
impresses me most about Kerry is that down deep, he is really a
fierce competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggleman said: ``He's gotten the respect of his teammates. At
the same time, this is a veteran team that has helped guide him
along and try not to put too much on him. The press and talk radio
are always talking about him. He goes out there now and strikes out
six in six innings or eight in seven innings, and it's like 'Why
didn't you do more?'''
</P>
<P>
   Wood seems to understand the legacy of being a power pitcher. As
a teen-ager in the Dallas area, he watched Ryan close his career
with the Texas Rangers. Wood was at Arlington Stadium when Ryan
pitched his seventh no-hitter in 1990. Wood's father, Garry, told
the Chicago Tribune this summer that, ``I thought Nolan Ryan was
the best pitcher I'd ever seen. So we tried to emulate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he didn't ask for the No. 34 that Ryan wore during his
career when he reported to the Cubs. Nor did he balk when he was
assigned that number during his first spring training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really a nut for him like everyone's making out,''
Wood said about Ryan. ``I watched him, but I didn't have to watch
every start he made. I watched him if I was flipping through and
the game was on, sure, I didn't change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great career, and he'll be remembered in baseball
forever. I don't even have a full season, so it's kind of pointless
to even think about a comparison at this stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ryan, Wood is aware that the effectiveness of his breaking
ball will determine whether or not he has a dominant game. Ryan was
only as good as his curve; Wood relies on a hard-breaking slider
and a curve that catcher Scott Servais, the former Astro, says is
as good as ex-teammate Darryl Kile's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breaking ball determines whether you're going to be out
there for two innings or you're going to be out there for eight,''
said Wood. ``Last year (in the minors), that's why I struggled so
much. I wasn't getting my breaking ball over, and I was getting
knocked out early. Regardless of how hard you throw, even if you're
out there throwing 120 mph, they'll time you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be OK the first time through, but after that they'll
time it and you'll get beat. The breaking ball and off-speed stuff
makes your fastball that much more effective. My strikeout pitch
this year has been my slider. You can also use the fastball to set
them up. It can work both ways if you have an effective breaking
ball. You want to keep them off balance and keep them guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Servais, a seven-year veteran who is not prone to exaggeration,
says that Wood is ``the best pitcher I've ever caught, and I caught
some good ones in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's legit,'' said Servais. ``His curve is probably as good as
Darryl Kile's, just not as consistent yet. But Darryl wasn't
consistent, either, for a long time. His fastball is consistently
95, 96 (mph) and when the big boys come up, the top two or three
hitters on every team, he has a tendency to throw it a couple miles
an hour faster. It's a Nolan-like fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   The key for Wood the rest of this season, says Servais, is to
disregard the high expectations and trust his overpowering stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's struggled a little bit the last two weeks, and it's a
combination of a couple things,'' said Servais. ``Part of it is
that the expectations are so high every time he goes out. That's
tough. He's 21 years old and people expect him to strike out 20
every time and win every time. It's like, `Oh, Wood's pitching
today, the Cubs are going to win.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few little mechanical adjustments he needs to make
that he's aware of. And a lot of people are concerned about the
fact that he's never gone through this long of a season before.
You're not going to know how you do until you go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his recent downturn, Wood says he has been able to enjoy
his rookie season. The pressure of having been so close to pitching
perfection in his fifth start in the majors isn't taking away from
a wondrous summer in which he turned 21 and had the world by the
tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a blast,'' said Wood. ``This is a childhood dream
that I get to live out every day. I'm having a great time.
Everything that comes along with it is just fine.'' &QL;

Strikeout pitchers a special blend of raw power, grace
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For all its perfect, timeless symmetry and graceful
choreography, baseball is most compelling when it's a
brute-strength, mano-a-mano battle, lightning vs. thunder.
</P>
<P>
   What fans most love to see is a strikeout-minded pitcher
reaching far back and heaving lasers at a muscle-packed batsman
trying to return serve to the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   In this, baseball's comeback season (labor pains finally
subsiding, attendance rising), the nation is captivated by the
Daily Home Run Watch, the likes of which it hasn't seen since Roger
Maris and Mickey Mantle were alive and chasing the ghost of home
run deity Babe Ruth some 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But if the frequent rocket launches by Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa
and Ken Griffey Jr. weren't enough to draw media salutes _ the
cover of Time magazine _ Major League Baseball now brings its fans
another bonus: strikeout glory.
</P>
<P>
   The physics of the sport dictate that strikeouts proliferate
about the same time home runs do. Astros manager Larry Dierker
observes: ``The two things go together. Home run hitters swing
hard, and they strike out a lot _ except for Joe DiMaggio (who
never struck out more than 39 times in a season).
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are trying to be home run hitters these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros shared, unwittingly, in one of baseball's special
moments, on May 6 in Wrigley Field. Kerry Wood, the precocious,
21-year-old Chicago Cub who is scheduled to pitch today in the
Astrodome, struck out 20 the last time he faced the Astros. He tied
the single-game major-league strikeout record set _ and later
matched _ by Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   This year the major leagues have two pitchers on pace for 300
strikeouts, Curt Schilling, a former Astro, and Randy Johnson, the
newly hired _ or rented _ gun who has won his first three starts
for the Astros, with two of them shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Strikeouts are trendy. National League games last season
averaged an all-time high 13.7 of them. The average increased every
year from 1992 (11.7) through '97, with this year's average down
only slightly, to 13.4.
</P>
<P>
   It's the batters who aren't obsessed with distance who are
difficult to overpower. San Diego's short-swinging Tony Gwynn is
the bane of the strikeout pitcher. He has fanned only once every 32
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a pitch that crosses the plate that he can't put
his bat on,'' Schilling says. ``He's the one guy with a runner on
third and less than two outs that I feel I wouldn't have much
chance to strike out.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are not many Gwynns. So any time a Wood or a Johnson
or a Schilling takes the mound, the possibility lurks for a
20-strikeout gem or a no-hitter. Which is why Johnson, who no-hit
Detroit in 1990, is accustomed to seeing crowds increase 10,000 and
more on nights he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a novelty going to a game when you can watch a
guy strike out a lot of people,'' Johnson says. ``Much like it's
fun to watch Mark McGwire have a chance to hit a home run farther
than you've ever seen.'' &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   If Houston has any baseball tradition of note, it's that of
power arms.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition dates to Don Wilson (18 strikeouts in one game,
two no-hitters) in the 1960s. It continued with the imposing J.R.
Richard (two 300-strikeout seasons) in the '70s and Nolan Ryan (the
all-time strikeout king) and Mike Scott (300 K's, a Cy Young Award)
in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The torch of fire is carried now by Johnson and Billy Wagner,
baseball's hardest-throwing lefthanders of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans like that style of pitching, and I enjoy watching
that style of pitcher,'' says Ryan, who retired in 1993 with 5,174
strikeouts. ``I've always enjoyed watching Billy Wagner and the way
he's gone about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner last year had the highest strikeout average in
major-league history (minimum of 50 innings), with 14.4 for nine
innings. This year he's about the same, at 14.1.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who actually try to last nine innings, Wood and
Johnson are tops, averaging 12 per game, followed by Philadelphia's
Schilling at 10.2.
</P>
<P>
   The one asset virtually all strikeout artists share is 95
mph-plus heat. Dierker, who had 232 strikeouts in 1969, says one
thing hasn't changed since his playing days: ``The guys who strike
out a lot of people are the guys who throw hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wood, Johnson, Wagner, Schilling, (Robb) Nen _ they have
overpowering stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   All rely primarily on their fastball, though none to the extent
Schilling does. Scouts report more than 90 percent of his pitches
are fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling justifies his fastball fascination: ``There's never
been a pitcher in the history of the game who's been successful
without command of his fastball, whether it's John Tudor (known for
his off-speed style) or Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling figures the more he uses his fastball, the more
control he'll have of it. He throws only the hard, straight,
four-seamer _ ``because I want to know where the ball will be when
it crosses the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   He averages just 2.0 walks per nine innings. He deftly moves the
ball in and out, keeping the batter guessing where it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most pitchers have one corner they can work pretty well, but
they have a little trouble finding the other corner,'' Dierker
says. ``Schilling can hit both corners at will. He's proof that the
best pitch in baseball is a well controlled fastball.'' &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Schilling was MVP of the '93 NL Championship Series, but he
didn't blossom into a 300-strikeout ace until last year. He credits
his newfound power to shoulder surgery by Dr. Craig Morgan in
Wilmington, Del. Schilling claims the repair of a frayed labrum
made his arm stronger than it had ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made things different for me in my approach,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   With his shoulder strengthened and his confidence raised, he
became much more aggressive, consciously pursuing stikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Most pitchers find it makes more sense to induce batters into
hitting bouncy grounders than to try to blow fastballs by them. But
the super-power throwers, such as Schilling and Johnson,
incorporate strikeouts into their strategy, depending on the game
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll start an at-bat thinking I want a strikeout,
but that's rare,'' Schilling says. ``I've noticed with Randy, he'll
get ahead in the count and then he'll air it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Johnson throws 93-95 much of the time. But he ratchets
it up 2-3 mph when a strikeout is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very different guy when he has two strikes,'' Schilling
says. ``I think I have somewhat the same philosophy. When I get
ahead in the count and find myself with two strikes, I will go for
the strikeout, because the strikeout eliminates any chance of the
runner reaching base.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he's ``not looking for a strikeout, but I just want
to put him away, whether it's a groundout or a flyout or a
strikeout. I don't want to lose him after all the hard work to put
him in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But yeah, I think my adrenaline, my intensity rises when I get
a guy 0-2, 1-2 and I have a chance to put him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tries to minimize the significance of strikeout numbers.
He doesn't want to violate the code that says winning is the only
thing that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about records; I don't try to strike people
out,'' he insists. ``In a couple of my games where I struck out 19,
I did try to strike out some people, and I couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strikeouts and home runs are things that just develop.'' &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Phil Garner, manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, faced Ryan in his
prime and has seen Wood pitch twice and Johnson many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan had the best fastball of anyone I've seen,'' Garner says.
``When he was putting everything into it, he'd grunt, expel the air
out of his body, and the next thing you'd hear was `Pow,' in the
mitt. You wouldn't even see the ball, like you would on everyone
else. His was just a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Randy Johnson, because of his size, might be the most
intimidating of the pitchers I've known. You're never sure whether
he's going to let one up and in. He makes you want to back away
just a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his height (6-10),'' Garner says, ``Johnson's ball
powers down, and the angle makes it very tough to hit. A hitter
likes to get his eye on the same plane as the ball, to track it,
and you can't do that with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Johnson has such a good breaking ball that lefthanders
don't have a chance against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although an explosive fastball is essential for high strikeout
totals, a reliable second pitch is also needed, or else the power
pitcher will be consigned to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy throws real hard but doesn't spin the ball well,
whether it's a slider or a curve, he can be successful as a
reliever,'' Dierker says. ``But he can't get through the lineup
three times. After a certain number of pitches he starts losing
velocity, and with no other pitch to go to, he's in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this decade, if a pitcher threw hard, he would stay in
the minor leagues until he mastered an off-speed pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But now, if a Wagner or a Nen (who throws 99 mph for San
Francisco) shows command of a fastball but not a breaking pitch, he
becomes a closer. All teams want plenty of heat waiting on the back
burner, the theory being that a 98-mph fastball is especially
daunting to weary ninth-inning batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros traded Schilling (for Jason Grimsley, in case you've
forgotten) in 1992, mistakenly assuming his preoccupation with
power precluded him from being a successful starter.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't realize Schilling's extraordinary control would
extend his velocity. He needed only 94 pitches for a three-hit
shutout last week in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling throws a sharply diving split-finger pitch, but he
uses it only once or twice an inning _ usually to fetch a third
strike on the unsuspecting batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I throw it right,'' he says, ``it has the same rotation
as my four-seam fastball. It's very hard for the batter to pick it
up early.'' &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Ryan may have been the hardest-throwing pitcher ever _ radar
clocked him at 105 in his prime. But he rarely won without command
of his curveball.
</P>
<P>
   Wood throws harder than any other starter in baseball _ 97-100
mph as the ball leaves his hand. But Garner notes that Wood also
``has a very good breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wood, as with many young power pitchers, the issue is
control. ``If he has good control,'' Dierker says, ``you're not
gonna hit him. If he doesn't have control, he's gonna struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who throw 95-plus are going to have a little trouble
controlling their fastball,'' Dierker says. ``The ball is moving so
fast, spinning so fast, it's hard to keep it on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Schilling had control even as a teen-ager, Ryan and
Johnson spent years searching for it. Once they gained command of
the heater, they were able to remain in games long enough to build
their impressive strikeout numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And whether they admit it or not, these power pitchers enjoy
their strikeouts as much as the fans who cheer them on.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson often pumps his fist to register pleasure when he
strikes out a batter. Clemens, who was born in Katy, has won 227
games and claims to value wins above strikeouts, but he gave his
four children names beginning with ``K'' and not ``W.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, 31, is a student of baseball history and a
memorabilia collector, and he doesn't mind saying he'd like to
leave his mark in the strikeout records.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it got close to 300, yeah, I was nervous and it was
something I wanted badly,'' he says. ``After that, I wanted the
record.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished last season with 319 strikeouts. The major-league
record (post-1900) is Ryan's 383, set in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   With teams using five-man rotations instead of four, as they did
in the 1970s, it will be difficult for Schilling or future pitchers
to acquire enough innings to challenge Ryan's record.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at the trends _ more home runs, more swinging from
the heels _ it's not out of the question that strikeout records _
along with home run records _ will be broken. &QL;

Column: Golf's Golden Boy watches luster fade
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ The signs were all there. This would be Phil
Mickelson's year. Golf's Golden Boy, its would-be lefthanded Golden
Bear, had served a long-enough apprenticeship. He was ready to win.
</P>
<P>
   Not the pedestrian events, nor the automotive ones, either. The
Buick Opens and the Mercedes Championships he long since had
figured out. Heck, he owned the Northern Telecom Open before he
owned a PGA Tour card. But what he hadn't mastered was the Masters
and the other majors, the four tournaments that, we're told, take
the true measure of a man's talents. And heart.
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday afternoon, though, Mickelson wore a bewildered
look on his made-for-fame face. Self-doubt had crept into his voice
as he stood behind the Sahalee clubhouse, trying to explain what
had happened, why another chance had blown up in his face.
</P>
<P>
   Guys named Stricker and Singh were running away with the 80th
PGA Championship and Mickelson, the can't-miss kid, was having to
answer for a third-round 78, scored in perfect conditions, that
caused him to free-fall from a respectable four shots behind the
leaders to 15.
</P>
<P>
   He must play today, but his tournament is over, as well as his
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be pretty difficult to get motivated,''
Mickelson said, referring to what's left on his '98 schedule.
``I'll keep playing. I mean, it's not the end of the world. But I'm
real disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson's major slumps
</P>
<P>
   He shot himself out of the Masters with a final-round 74. He
never contended at the U.S. Open, posting a 74 in the third round.
His British Open at Royal Birkdale became a royal mess when scores
of 85 and 78 on the weekend left him 28-over par, in 79th place.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Saturday. He needed 41 swings to get around the
front nine. He bogeyed five holes in a row. Golfers of Mickelson's
stature never bogey five holes in a row. But Phil, as in empty,
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like I was trying to get cute and make a bunch of
birdies, either.'' Mickelson said. ``I just couldn't make any
pars.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-putts. A series of buried bunker lies. Each horror begat
another. Even a modest face-saving on the back nine would include a
double bogey. He went from being nominally in the hunt to having to
punt. Of the 75 players who survived the cut, nobody shot more than
a stroke worse.
</P>
<P>
   So Sahalee becomes Mickelson's 26th major without a win. That's
nowhere near the record for taking a collar _ Tom Kite
hyperventilated through 67 to win his first _ but it's a dreadful
reality for a player with Mickelson's rsum. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   He was a four-time All-American and three-time NCAA champion at
Arizona State. When he won the NCAAs and the U.S. Amateur in the
same year, only Nicklaus had done it before him.
</P>
<P>
   He was just the third golfer, joining Nicklaus and Jerry Pate,
to win five tournaments before his 25th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   He was the fourth-youngest player in history to win a 10th
tournament, trailing only Horton Smith, Gene Sarazen and,
naturally, Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, 28, has 12 tour victories, the most recent in the
season's leadoff event, the Mercedes Championships, after which he
said: ``This year is going to be a proving ground for me because
I've set a lot of high goals. It's going to be a real challenge to
fulfill those. If I can, I can fulfill a lot of expectations people
have for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Running out of time
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday he was honest about whose expectations mattered the
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy other people want me to win,'' he said. ``I
appreciate the support. But nobody wants me to win (a major) more
than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he took a major stumble backward. At an age when
Nicklaus was well on his way to collecting 18 Grand Slam titles,
Mickelson hasn't the foggiest idea how to reverse his momentum and
get back on the fast track to immortality. If anything, he fears
he's drifting off the path.
</P>
<P>
   The younger twentysomethings _ Ernie Els, Justin Leonard, Tiger
Woods _ have beaten him to the breakthrough. If he has any
consolation, it's that players such as Tom Lehman, Davis Love III,
Steve Elkington, Fred Couples and, most belatedly, Mark O'Meara
have succeeded with a better-late-than-never approach. The
difference is none of them was supposed to win a bunch of majors.
</P>
<P>
   Negative thoughts creep into his game. He admits he finds
himself waiting for the next mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, the more difficult it becomes to think
positively.'' Mickelson said. ``You assume something bad is going
to happen. And then it does.''
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived here, he was shown a golf magazine cover with
his photograph on it and a large headline that asked: ``Does Phil
Mickelson have what it takes to win a major championship?'' While
he found the article to be ``fair and well-written,'' there was one
large problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked,'' he said, ``to have answered the question
better than I did.''

KIDS (Phoenix) _ He meticulously prepares for an inquiry like none

   POL-DRAMA (Washington) _ The months of singing, clapping and
praying are nearly over, and it's time for Bill Clinton to present
himself for atonement in the Baptist tradition. For those Americans
who have been watching the presidential sex scandal with mounting
incredulity, experts on Southern politics and religion have an
explanation: The legal drama is actually a Southern religious
pageant about redemption. It is less about small perjuries and more
about large sins like adultery. And in this tradition the customary
conclusion is the big, public, tearful confession. Witness

FREE HOUSE WINS
</HEADLINE>

By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ What Chris McCarron couldn't, or wouldn't, say
in the days leading up to the Pacific Classic, he conveyed as he
rode Free House past the grandstand early in the race Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a cocky individual, I'd have said, `If he runs the
way he's trained, they (his opponents) have (ITAL)no(END ITAL)
chance,' '' McCarron said later. ``But you couldn't have got me to
say that before the race.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he allowed Free House to run four-wide into the first
turn of the 1\-mile race, losing ground to favorites Gentlemen and
Touch Gold, the Hall of Fame jockey displayed his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   And it was warranted, because Free House made up those lost
lengths and more, going on to win the $1 million race by four
lengths, leaving defending champion Gentlemen second and invader
Touch Gold fifth. Pacificbounty and Lazy Lode finished third and
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was an especially satisfying victory for owners Trudy
McCaffery and John Toffan, and trainer Paco Gonzalez, coming after
a urine test produced uncorroborated evidence Free House had the
prohibited drug clenbuterol in his system when he won the Bel Air
Handicap in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we vindicated ourselves this afternoon,'' McCaffery
said.
</P>
<P>
   And it was just as satisfying for McCarron, confirming what he
already thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy with (racing wide),'' McCarron said. ``But I'm
thinking, `OK, don't panic. I'm on the best horse.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, who was aboard Free House for the first time when they
dominated the Bel Air in the gray, California-bred colt's
4-year-old debut, rode him in his recent workouts at Santa Anita
and liked what he felt.
</P>
<P>
   But if the 1997 Santa Anita Derby winner was the best horse in
the nine-horse Pacific Classic, it wasn't obvious to the crowd of
27,576, which came to watch the biggest race of the Del Mar season
and to contribute to a pick-six pool of $3,555,771 on a day track
management guaranteed a $2 million pool.
</P>
<P>
   Free House paid $9, going off as the third choice behind the 6-5
entry of Gentlemen and Puerto Madero and 3-2 Touch Gold.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen ran well, and trainer Richard Mandella said, ``Maybe
he's just not as good as he was last year.'' Puerto Madero finished
a punchless sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Touch Gold was never better than fourth, joining Cigar, Concern
and Unbridled on the list of big-name, out-of-state horses who
stumbled in the Pacific Classic. ``I'm at a loss to explain his
race,'' jockey Pat Day said.
</P>
<P>
   Free House, always on the outside, moved quickly from fifth to
contention on the backstretch, hooked Gentlemen on the turn for
home and took command entering the stretch. In the box seats,
trainer Paco Gonzalez grabbed McCaffery by the arm and said, ``We
got 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   It's never that easy with Free House, who, even in his 17th race
and seventh victory, shied from McCarron's whip and zigzagged
through the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got kind of scared,'' McCaffery said. But Free House
straightened and won in a solid 2:00 1/5, winning more convincingly
than top-ranked Skip Away beat a similar field in the Hollywood
Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The pick-six pool of more than $3.5 million set a Del Mar
record. But 254 tickets were perfect, so the payoff was small,
$7,821. The 10-race card produced another Del Mar record, total
wagering of $22.9 million. . . . Old Topper, facing elders for the
first time, stayed close to the pace under Eddie Delahoussaye and
won the 7-furlong Pat O'Brien Handicap in a $23 upset over Son of a
Pistol. He and Bold Brawley (1986) are the only 3-year-olds to win
the O'Brien. Alex Solis sent Son of a Pistol to the early lead, not
the gelding's usual style.

O'Meara likes his chances
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
REDMOND, Wash. _ They remind Mark O'Meara on every hole at Sahalee
Country Club, as though wishing it will make it come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Mark, things always happen in threes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark, the third time is the charm.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans at this PGA Championship have been generous in their
praise for nearly all of the golfers in the field, but they sense
O'Meara has the chance to accomplish something very special. And
after shooting a 1-under-par 69 in Saturday's third round to put
himself five strokes behind the leaders, O'Meara has given himself
a chance to do what no golfer has done since Ben Hogan in 1953 _
win three major championships in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go out there and play the way I played today and hole
some of the putts, I think I have a reasonable shot at it,''
O'Meara said. ``I don't think that I'm out of the tournament by any
means. And I'm going to go out there and play hard and try to play
smart and give myself a chance. That's all you can ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans, of course, are asking for a little bit more. They want
to watch O'Meara make history firsthand, and they've left little
doubt about how they feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the people out there are pulling for me,'' O'Meara said
with a smile. ``So I'm using that as a positive. Their feedback
coming toward me is wonderful. Hopefully tomorrow I won't let them
down, and I can get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara started the final round of the Masters and the British
Open two shots off the lead. He has more ground to make up this
time but also more experience as well. O'Meara didn't win his first
major championship until he was 41 when he won the Masters, but he
quickly put his new-found knowledge to good use at the British
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the British Open, I used some of the experience that I
gained at the Masters,'' he said. ``And now I'm using that same
experience to try to play well here and win this championship. So
whether I have a little bit of an edge coming down the stretch if
I'm close to the lead, yes and no. I mean, I've got pressure on me
just like every other player has on him.''
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, however, this new Mark O'Meara doesn't seem to
show the pressure. His playing partners all week have remarked
about how calm and collected he seems. Even after a bad shot,
O'Meara never appears to get rattled and never seems to lose his
control.
</P>
<P>
   He also has handled all of the pressure that comes from winning
not just one but two majors in one season with easy grace. There
have been no temper tantrums, no whining that the demands on his
time are too great. O'Meara, in fact, has flourished with all of
the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an honor to have your peers come up to you and tell
you how happy they are for you, for the success you've had,''
O'Meara said. ``And the success I've have this year has been
tremendous. If you were going to pick a couple of tournaments that
you'd like to win in one year, most people would put those two
tournaments very high on their list. So with it comes a lot of
respect and a lot of admiration from the fans and your peers, which
is a tremendously nice thing to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts a little more pressure on me, because I think people
expect me to play well. But I expect to play well. So we're trying
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be apparent pretty early in today's final round whether
O'Meara will have a shot at another title. He will have to get off
to a good start, and the co-leaders will have to stumble. But
O'Meara still has a chance, and for him, that is good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who is going to hit greens and make some putts is
going to win this championship tomorrow,'' O'Meara said. ``If I can
do that, I might have a chance on the last few holes tomorrow.''

   DUBLIN, Ireland _ In the deadliest paramilitary attack ever in
Northern Ireland, a car bomb killed 28 people on Saturday and
injured more than 200 others, including pregnant women and infants,
in the town of Omagh, 55 miles west of Belfast, the capital of the
British province.
</P>
<P>
   The blast raised fears for the survival of the Northern Ireland
peace agreement between the majority Protestants and minority Roman
Catholics, as the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic
watched scenes of spilled blood and destruction on the evening
television news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was carnage,'' said Nigel O'Kane, whose pub is a few
hundred yards from the explosion, which killed or injured many
shoppers. It happened at about 3 p.m., a half hour after the
bombers made an apparently misleading phone call to a newspaper
warning that a bomb would be detonated.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports that a Roman Catholic splinter
group calling itself the Real IRA had claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night in Belfast, Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn
Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political wing, denounced the
attack. Normally, Adams, who is a member of the new Northern
Ireland Assembly, denounces violence but declines to criticize
specific Catholic paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Irish National Television reported that the police at the scene
believed that the warning call was deliberately misleading in order
to maximize the number of victims.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said the terrorists had given a
``totally inaccurate warning'' so as to kill as many people as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   There were few who believed that the misleading warning was a
simple mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The caller, giving a code name recognized as one used by the
Irish Republican Army, according to the police, said the bomb would
go off near the court house. The police then moved crowds of
shoppers several hundred yards away from the court house; but the
bomb exploded at the spot to where the shoppers had been moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's ever happened in this town in such a long time,''
O'Kane said, adding: ``There are a lot of people in tears,
panicking, looking for their loved ones. They don't know if they're
dead or injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the injured were flown in helicopters to hospitals
elsewhere in the province. Local hospitals called for blood donors
and volunteer doctors. Several shops were devastated, and the
streets one-half mile from the center of town were covered with
rubble. British soldiers, the police, firefighters and paramedics
searched for survivors and more dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is blood everywhere,'' said Ken Maginnis, a member of
the British Parliament and a leader of the mainstream Protestant
Ulster Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was obvious that the bombers were a Catholic
Republican splinter group opposed to the peace effort that produced
an accord approved in May in referendums in the North and here in
the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Dublin to crack down on the group, the Real IRA,
which is believed to operate out of the Irish Republic, crossing
the border into the North for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish Republican Army has been observing a cease-fire for 13
months, and the dissidents maintain that the peace agreement is a
sellout of republican goals, particularly the establishment of a
unified Ireland with the mostly Protestant north subsumed in the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of the Irish Republic said the blast
was ``the most horrific act in years, a tragic day.'' He said the
Irish Republic would seek ``to crush these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern added that the Irish government would ``ruthlessly
repress'' the terrorist group, which is believed to comprise about
100 Catholic dissidents splintered away from the main Irish
Republican Army. The splinter group is believed to have ties with a
political party, the 32-County Continuity Committees, which opposed
the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain called the blast ``an
appalling attack of savagery and evil by people who are determined,
whatever the cost to innocent people, to wreck the prospects for
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth expressed shock at the bombing. She offered ``my
heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, the moderate Catholic leader who is the principal
initiator of the peace effort, said the terrorists were ``trying to
destroy the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Paisley Jr., son of the hardline Protestant leader, said the
attack was the result of coddling of republicans by the British and
Irish governments, which have begun the early release of
paramilitary prisoners. He accused Dublin and London of creating
``an endless bloody violent circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Paddy McGann, a local official in Omagh, said the Protestants
and Catholics in the town had lived peaceably together, free of
terrorist attacks for years. He noted that the attacks, attributed
to Catholic dissidents, came on the Assumption of the Blessed
Virgin, an important feast day for Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope whoever did this say their prayers tonight,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton condemned the attack. Clinton
is scheduled to visit Northern Ireland on Sept. 3, and his
spokesman said the president had no plans to cancel the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I renew my pledge to stand with the people of Northern Ireland
against the perpetrators of violence; they will find no friends
here,'' Clinton said in a statement. ``On behalf of the American
people, I condemn this butchery.''
</P>
<P>
   The governments of Britain and the Irish Republic, sponsors of
the peace effort, have repeatedly stated that terrorism by
dissident groups would not destroy the effort, under which a new
Northern Ireland Assembly convened in June to work out a new
political structure that would give Northern minority Catholics
more power.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's attack could lead to retaliation by Protestant
paramilitaries, which in turn would put pressure on the IRA to end
its cease-fire and return the province to the sectarian warfare
that has killed more than 3,200 people since 1969.

RANGERS ROLL IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez demonstrated yesterday
that perhaps one defensive play _ no matter its timeliness _ could
be viewed as the most significant element of an 11-run victory.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred during the second inning of a game that consumed 3
hours, 48 minutes of a beautiful afternoon at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers overcame a four-run, first-inning deficit for a
stirring, 16-5 victory against the New York Yankees, and many would
regard the second-inning grand slam by left fielder Rusty Greer as
the game's critical element.
</P>
<P>
   Greer's home run culminated the visitors' six-run explosion, and
a three-run, eighth-inning home run by right fielder Mike Simms
ensured the Rangers' first victory since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Rodriguez's catch-and-tag exploit might be the play that
kept the Rangers within a half-game of the first-place Anaheim
Angels in the American League West after their 6-3 in victory in 11
innings against the Blue Jays yesterday in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they score there,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said, ``I
believe it makes it a different ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer's opposite-field home run off losing right-hander Hideki
Irabu (11-6) gave the Rangers a 6-4 lead, but Rangers right-hander
Todd Stottlemyre _ who surrendered four runs on five hits and walk
during the first inning _ continued his flirtations with disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees loaded the bases with one out for center fielder
Bernie Williams, and the Yankees cleanup hitter lined a Stottlemyre
pitch into right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers center fielder Tom Goodwin chased the ball down and made
a running catch in the gap. Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch
tagged and scored easily on the play, and shortstop Derek Jeter
advanced toward third base.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin threw the ball to shortstop Royce Clayton, who served as
the cutoff man on the play. Clayton, though, bobbled and dropped
the throw. Jeter, who witnessed the misplay, rounded third and
continued toward the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton retrieved the loose ball and unleashed a strong throw
that short-hopped Rodriguez at the plate. Rodriguez fielded the
tough bounce in the dirt cleanly, blocked Jeter from the plate and
made the tag to preserve the Rangers' one-run advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way Pudge was going to let him score,'' said
Stottlemyre, who afterward pitched four scoreless innings for his
second victory in three decisions despite an afternoon of
unrelenting ordeals. ``He got the ball and sat down right in front
of the plate. He pumped me up.''
</P>
<P>
   The play ranked more improbable considering Rodriguez's
reputation as a catcher whose strengths do not include blocking the
plate from runners attempting to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been told before,'' Oates said, ``that it's better to
live to fight another day than die a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusual, inning-ending double play prevented the Yankees
from tying the game and stranded first baseman Tino Martinez in the
on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was huge to get two outs on that particular play,''
Clayton said. ``You really don't want to face Tino in that
situation with runners at first and third and two outs. He's one of
those guys who has the ability to put the ball in the seats. It was
good for us to get out of that inning and immediately put up
another run.''
</P>
<P>
   Simms' third-inning, run-scoring single provided Stottlemyre a
two-run cushion, and his home run off right-hander Ramiro Mendoza
gave the Rangers a 10-5 lead. The Rangers later blasted
right-hander Joe Borowski for another six runs in the ninth inning
as they sent 11 batters to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Even that did nothing to diminish what is arguably Rodriguez's
finest defensive moment this season.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing prepared right-hander Todd Stottlemyre for
this appearance at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old veteran could not draw upon five World Series
and seven League Championship Series appearances for comfort during
this encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three thousand people attended the Rangers' 16-5 victory
yesterday against the Yankees, and Stottlemyre's emotions allowed
one person in the visitors' dugout affect him.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre's father, Mel, serves as the Yankees' pitching
coach, and it represented the first time the two emerged as
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably emotionally tougher to prepare for and pitch
than any game I've ever been in _ and that includes all the World
Series games, playoff games and big games I've pitched in down the
stretch,'' said Stottlemyre, whom the Rangers acquired July 31 from
the Cardinals. ``I'm glad it's over, but I'm glad I got the
opportunity to do it. It will always be a great memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre earned his second victory in three starts with the
Rangers, but the right-hander encountered unrelenting difficulties.
Stottlemyre surrendered five runs on nine hits and six walks during
his six-inning, 116-pitch appearance and wondered if he would
escape the Yankees' four-run first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a confusing inning, and there were so many base
runners,'' said Stottlemyre, who did not allow a run during his
final four innings despite the Yankees' unyielding pressure. ``They
don't have any easy outs. I was just trying to do anything to get
out of the first inning because it was ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel's afternoon would be worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a day I should have stayed home,'' said the elder
Stottlemyre, whose pitching staff allowed 19 hits and issued six
walks. ``Watching my son struggle and our guys struggle ... was
really difficult, a tough day on me overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd's mother, Jean, sat with her son's wife, Sheri, and her
3-year-old granddaughter, Rachel, in the stands. Jean, even though
Mel's wife, would not be a Yankees fan this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she was rooting for me,'' Todd said. ``There's no doubt
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean told him as much beforehand, and the five planned to spend
the evening together over dinner afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll have to pick up the tab,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the afternoon concluded with one Stottlemyre emerging as
the game's winning pitcher and the other a coach on baseball's best
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything refreshing about today,'' Mel said, ``it's
that he needed it and their team needed it more than we did.''

IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS, LINK EMERGES TO RICH SAUDI  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for new info re Pakistan)   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Law enforcement officials said Saturday night that
American investigators in Pakistan were preparing to fly to Kenya
with a man whom they identified as a suspect in last week's embassy
bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the investigators had been sent to
Pakistan to question several people who had been arrested there in
connection with the bombings. They would not identify the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The people under arrest are suspected of being associated with
Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born businessman who has vowed to wage a
holy war against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested in Pakistan are people who are believed to
have flown from Kenya to Pakistan after the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. authorities flew to Pakistan on Saturday after
Pakistani security police notified them that the man had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The officials declined to specify the nature of the evidence
connecting bin Laden to the bombings. But Saturday's issue of
Newsday reported that a witness had identified a bin Laden
associate as having been in the truck carrying the bomb that
damaged the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Kenya and killed more
than 200 people. The newspaper identified the witness as one of the
two privately employed security guards working at the embassy gate
at the time of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on Saturday, intelligence and law enforcement
officials who spoke on condition that they not be identified said
that there had been no positive identification of the person, who
was described as a relatively low-level member of bin Laden's
circle. It was not clear if he was the person being taken to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   But officials indicated that this was the first potential link
to bin Laden, whom the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
Central Intelligence Agency have suspected from the start was a key
figure in the bombing plot. American officials have cited him since
the early hours of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he renewed his vow to wage a holy war against the
United States, and senior officials have said that he has a network
in Africa, with U.S. intelligence finding evidence that he has
operatives in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials caution that there is still no hard evidence
linking bin Laden or his agents to the bombings, Americans point to
the nearly simultaneous explosions on Aug. 7 as a sign that the
attacks were carried out by sophisticated terrorists. Bin Laden's
network has the financial resources and the organization to have
been the mastermind, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group suspected by the United States is the Cairo-based
Islamic Jihad, but it, too, is financed by bin Laden, American
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a wealthy Saudi family that made its money in the
construction business, bin Laden is thought to have been involved
in the bombings of two U.S. military installations in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   But for lack of evidence, the United States has never issued an
arrest warrant for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden lived for a time in Sudan. He is said to live in
Afghanistan now, under the protection of the Taliban, the
fundamentalist Islamic group that controls most of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said that bin Laden had become the
subject of an intense internal discussion at the FBI over whether
the New York office should take jurisdiction of the bombing case
away from the Washington field office, which has jurisdiction over
crimes against Americans in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials in New York have argued that they have
investigated bin Laden in connection with the World Trade Center
bombing, and therefore should take over the Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam cases in the event that he proves to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in an address videotaped for broadcast
overseas, said that the Kenyans and Tanzanians killed in the
bombings ``were important to America because we cherish our
friendship with your peoples.'' At least 247 Kenyans and 10
Tanzanians died. More than 5,000 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent extremists try to use bullets and bombs to derail our
united efforts to bring peace to every part of the earth,'' Clinton
said. ``We grieve together, but I am proud that our nations have
also renewed our commitment to stand together.''

Stricker, Singh have work cut out
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
REDMOND, Wash. _ Nine out of the last 10 PGA Championships have
been won by players without a previous major championship victory.
</P>
<P>
   That bodes well for co-leaders Steve Stricker and Vijah Singh,
who are tied at 7-under-par 203 and hold a four-stroke lead on the
field in this 1998 PGA Championship. Both men will be seeking their
first major title today at Sahalee Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   But a quick glance over their shoulders should end any warm,
fuzzy feelings they may be having about their position heading into
the final round. Because the men chasing them are a formidable
group indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker shot a 4-under 66 Saturday that included a great
up-and-down to save par on No. 18 to finish tied with Singh, who
turned in a 67. Stricker and Singh both have shown they can win,
with seven PGA Tour victories between them. But Stricker hasn't won
since 1996, and neither man has ever taken a lead into the final
round of a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there will be a little bit more pressure on myself
and Steve,'' Singh said. ``It really depends on how we start off
and how the rest of the guys are playing. But anybody within five,
six shots has got a chance of winning this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   How's this for a who's who list of pursuers?
</P>
<P>
   At 3-under 207 is defending champion Davis Love III, who won his
first major championship at the 1997 PGA Championship at Winged
Foot. Joining him is last week's winner, Billy Mayfair, along with
former PGA Champion Steve Elkington, who has recorded three
consecutive 69s at Sahalee and is playing his best golf of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   One shot behind them at 208 is Mark O'Meara, who has already won
two majors this season and is making a bid to become the first man
since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three major titles in one year.
Keeping pace with O'Meara is 1997 Masters champion Tiger Woods,
along with Skip Kendall and Frank Lickliter.
</P>
<P>
   Love, for one, had to believe being in this position before, and
succeeding, would serve him well today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a little bit of an advantage,'' he said. ``I'll be a
little bit more comfortable than maybe Steve or Vijay. And then you
have others, like Steve Elkington, who's won and been there a lot.
Anything can happen. But I'll feel like I have at least a chance
because I've done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   All of those in the hunt agreed, however, that Stricker and
Singh will have to stumble for any past major success to become any
factor at all. And neither man showed much in the form of weakness
during Saturday's third round.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker had one of the few bogey-free rounds of the tournament,
making three birdies on the front side and then sinking a 10-footer
at No. 16 for his 66. In fact, Stricker has been unflappable all
week, one of the few players under par for every round. Even when
he was in trouble on No. 18, after hitting his second shot into the
trees, Stricker managed to scramble and save par and his share of
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker also has been playing some incredible golf as of late.
He has finished eighth or better in five of his last seven
tournaments and has made nearly $640,000 in official money. That is
all welcome news to Stricker, who won twice in 1996 and then had a
horrendous 1997 season, finishing 130th on the money list with only
one top-10 finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's round is one of my best rounds that I've ever played,
under the circumstances and under the pressure, which gives me a
whole lot of confidence,'' Stricker said. ``It may be difficult
tomorrow. I haven't been in this situation before. So I'm just
going to have to try to worry about my own game starting off, and
try to get myself going in a nice positive direction and feeling
good about what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh's round wasn't quite as smooth as Stricker's on the front
side, where he made three bogeys, but he rebounded nicely on the
final nine, making birdie on four of the first six holes on the
back side.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main plan was to go out there and shoot a solid round and
not be out of the tournament,'' Singh said. ``That back nine I
played really good. That got me back in the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh also has played solidly in recent weeks, finishing in the
top 12 in three of his last four events. His last chance to win was
at the Motorola Western Open in June, where he took a two-stroke
lead into the final round but ended up in second place, trailing by
two.
</P>
<P>
   After his round Saturday, Singh vowed not to change his routine
at all for today's run at the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to keep doing what I've been doing all week,'' he
said. ``I felt really comfortable on the back nine, and even on the
front side. But it's a major event. You never know what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you haven't been there before. So it was O'Meara,
the master of the majors this year, who had the best bit of advice
for the two men he will be chasing today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they're going to learn is that they've got a nice
opportunity tomorrow to go out and play well and try to win this
championship,'' O'Meara said. ``They'll learn about being patient
and going out there and hitting a couple of bad shots and not
getting too frustrated. It's going to be a long day. So you just
have to hang in there and give yourself a chance coming up the last
few holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the philosophy that I try to use, and I'll think that's
what they'll use, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A valuable lesson. The only problem for Singh and Stricker is
that it is one a number of the men who are behind them already have
learned.

 DEBUT OF iMAC LIVES UP TO HYPE  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget that it has the fastest modem around. Never mind the
oodles of built-in software or the memory that leaves other
computers in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   It's just darn cute.
</P>
<P>
   At least that seemed to be the consensus among tech-heads who
swarmed Arizona computer stores Saturday to scoop up the hottest
commodity: Apple's iMac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a really cool machine, that's all,'' said Art
Landrey, a high school math teacher who bought the first iMac at
Computer Town in Chandler on Saturday. ``If you're going to have a
computer, this is the one to have.''
</P>
<P>
   The retro-looking machine has been the talk of the computer
world since Apple announced it would unveil its first new model in
years.
</P>
<P>
   And the much-hyped debut didn't disappoint Saturday, as stores
sold out of the funky Mac faster than they could say ``megabyte.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to our zoo,'' said Jerry Koszut, a salesman at
Computer Town in Chandler, where customers bought up 100 iMacs in a
matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of customers started peering into the store as early
as 7 a.m. and hovered around waiting for the doors to open.
</P>
<P>
   Landrey and his 14-year-old son showed up precisely when the
store opened at 9 a.m. They smiled proudly for a Polaroid snapshot
and picked out some Star Wars game software, before lugging the
prized possession to their car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking it home and hooking it up,'' Landrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Valley stores, with smaller supplies of the computer, sold
out in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened at 8 and they were gone before 9,'' said Benjamin
Whiting, manager of Re-Mac, a Macintosh retailer in Mesa. ``We've
just got one on display left now.''
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, with its transparent plastic monitor and black
keyboard, is a far cry from Apple's first tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original was kind of a joke. I have one that I turned into
an aquarium,'' said Koszut, who has been selling Apple computers
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The new model is an all-in-one piece, complete with a superfast
modem, a CD-ROM, stereo speakers, an out-of-this-world look and
15-inch screen.
</P>
<P>
   All for $1,299.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newer ones have all the features that they could want at a
price they can afford,'' Koszut said.
</P>
<P>
   And local stores were offering deals on extra memory and
software for the iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Elsasser, who works at Arizona State University, picked
one up for her home, along with 32 extra megbytes of free memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are just really excited because it
looks really cool,'' she said. &QL;

EXECUTIVE, ONCE SPOTLIGHTED IN A DIVORCE, TO WED AGAIN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His divorce became a messy public spectacle that
titillated and terrified corporate executives across the country,
but Gary C. Wendt is getting married again anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old chairman of GE Capital Corp., General Electric's
most profitable subsidiary, is scheduled to wed Rosemarie Adams
Sunday night at the First Church of Round Hill in Greenwich, Conn.
Wendt's spokesman, Peter Rosenthal, described the prospective groom
as ``cheerful and optimistic'' but offered few details about the
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they want a private ceremony,'' said Rosenthal, of
Howard J. Rubenstein and Associates. ``Gary generally is a private
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy has been a rarity since Wendt and his first wife, Lorna
J. Wendt, waged a divorce battle that spiraled into the news media
as a test case of the rights _ and value _ of stay-at-home
corporate wives. Rejecting an initial settlement offer of $10
million, Mrs. Wendt and her lawyers contended that she was entitled
to half of her husband's net worth, estimated at $45 million to
$130 million.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as supportive spouse, Mrs. Wendt said, she had
managed their household, entertained her husband's business
associates and even helped put him through Harvard Business School.
The Wendts, who were high school sweethearts, were married for more
than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt's lawyers argued that his ex-wife had distorted the
equality issue. ``Gary's stand was that he always offered half,''
said Marsha Horowitz, another of Wendt's spokesmen. ``The issue had
to do with future, not-yet-earned options. That was the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The case reverberated in corporate suites across America where a
different set of rules applies in divorce cases. While an even
split is common in divorces for ordinary people, judges
historically have been leery of awarding a wife an equal share when
the net worth is above $10 million. Suddenly, corporate titans
faced the prospect of a judge's ruling that a wife was entitled to
half of everything.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, last December, Judge Kevin Tierney of Connecticut
Superior Court resisted any sweeping historical precedent. He
dissolved the marriage, awarding Mrs. Wendt more than $20 million
in money and property, in addition to future stock and pension
options. Both spouses filed appeals and a final settlement is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wendt did not return calls to her Stamford, Conn., home
Saturday. She has founded the Foundation for Equality in Marriage
to advocate her belief that society _ and the courts _ should
better recognize the nonmonetary contributions made to a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The prolonged, bitter divorce apparently has not dimmed Wendt's
opinion of matrimony.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt and Ms. Adams, who are close in age, met in Monte Carlo in
1995, the same year Wendt asked his wife for a divorce. A meetings
planner, Ms. Adams was running a business incentive program for GE
Capital in Europe. She has since retired. Her first marriage, like
Wendt's, ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said he did not know if the couple had signed a
pre-nuptial agreement.

HAIL MARY PASS NEEDED FOR LINEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
After months of painstaking ef fort, scientists now concede that
even their most sophisticated com puters can't calculate the total
number of news stories more impor tant than whether Bill Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky . . . you know.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They can say for sure, however, that one of those stories
involves a former Arizona State University offensive lineman named
Joe Cajic.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Croatian name, pronounced CHI-ich.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's parents immigrated here looking for a better life, and
have done what immigrants do to get it. They worked like dogs. It's
a philosophy they passed onto their two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, The Arizona Republic reporter covering ASU's
training camp wrote, ``The work horse award goes to guard Joe
Cajic. . . . The transfer from Southern Cal made it for 70 of a
possible 72 weight-room workouts over the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cajic grew up in Phoenix and attended Shadow Mountain High
School. He was champion discus thrower and shot-putter and one of
the state's most sought high school football recruits.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother had attended ASU. Joe picked the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few years, I felt like I wanted to come home,'' Joe
says.
</P>
<P>
   Cajic is 6-foot-5, and in those days he weighed about 275
pounds. He spent his junior and senior years at ASU blocking for a
young quarterback named Jake Plummer. But, because of shoulder
surgery and other injuries, the pros were out of reach for Joe. &QL; 
ANOTHER PLAY
</P>
<P>
   After college, he took a job with a roofing wholesaler. He
traveled and put in long hours. Last year, he began suffering
headaches and back pain. He figured it was because he was on his
feet too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the doctor to get checked out,'' he says. ``They ran
a few tests, then told me the results: leukemia.''
</P>
<P>
   The news hit him low and hard, like a crack-back block. But,
it's never been Joe's nature to cry foul. He simply got up and got
back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The only cure for his particular type of leukemia is a bone
marrow transplant. His family underwent blood tests to see if any
of them were potential donors. They weren't. Family was contacted
in Croatia. No one there matched, either. An inter national
computer search was run through the National Marrow Donor Program.
No luck.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't stop Joe or his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I need to do with my time now,'' he says, ``is get more
people to register as potential donors.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fairly easy. All it takes is a little blood and $40. You
can find out about it by contacting the local marrow donor office
at 675-5493 or by calling the national hotline at 800-MARROW2.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Judy Bartholomeaux, who manages the local program, told
me, ``It's a very small chance any of us will match a person in
need. But wouldn't it be a grand thing if we did?'' &QL; 
DOESN'T TAKE MUCH
</P>
<P>
   Donating marrow requires an overnight stay in the hospital and a
few weeks with a sore hip.
</P>
<P>
   For that, you can save a life.
</P>
<P>
   If that's too much, though, cash donations can be made to United
Blood Services to help offset the $40-per-donor fees.
</P>
<P>
   In Joe's case, like many others, a donor would most likely come
from his ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 2.5 million Croats out there,'' he says.
``They tell me there's a one-in-a-million chance I'll find a donor.
To me, that means there are two donors out there. I've just got to
find one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when a team needs a touchdown and time is running
out, a coach sends his receivers to the end zone and has his
quarterback loft the ball into the crowd, praying for a miracle
catch.
</P>
<P>
   This only works if linemen like Joe Cajic can hold off the other
team's rush.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Joe's doing, now. Blocking the opposition, like the
old days.
</P>
<P>
   And hoping there's somebody out there, some friend, some
stranger, going long. &QL;

HAIL MARY PASS NEEDED FOR LINEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI 
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
After months of painstaking ef fort, scientists now concede that
even their most sophisticated com puters can't calculate the total
number of news stories more impor tant than whether Bill Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky . . . you know.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They can say for sure, however, that one of those stories
involves a former Arizona State University offensive lineman named
Joe Cajic.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Croatian name, pronounced CHI-ich.
</P>
<P>
   Joe's parents immigrated here looking for a better life, and
have done what immigrants do to get it. They worked like dogs. It's
a philosophy they passed onto their two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, The Arizona Republic reporter covering ASU's
training camp wrote, ``The work horse award goes to guard Joe
Cajic. . . . The transfer from Southern Cal made it for 70 of a
possible 72 weight-room workouts over the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cajic grew up in Phoenix and attended Shadow Mountain High
School. He was champion discus thrower and shot-putter and one of
the state's most sought high school football recruits.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother had attended ASU. Joe picked the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few years, I felt like I wanted to come home,'' Joe
says.
</P>
<P>
   Cajic is 6-foot-5, and in those days he weighed about 275
pounds. He spent his junior and senior years at ASU blocking for a
young quarterback named Jake Plummer. But, because of shoulder
surgery and other injuries, the pros were out of reach for Joe. &QL; 
ANOTHER PLAY
</P>
<P>
   After college, he took a job with a roofing wholesaler. He
traveled and put in long hours. Last year, he began suffering
headaches and back pain. He figured it was because he was on his
feet too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the doctor to get checked out,'' he says. ``They ran
a few tests, then told me the results: leukemia.''
</P>
<P>
   The news hit him low and hard, like a crack-back block. But,
it's never been Joe's nature to cry foul. He simply got up and got
back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The only cure for his particular type of leukemia is a bone
marrow transplant. His family underwent blood tests to see if any
of them were potential donors. They weren't. Family was contacted
in Croatia. No one there matched, either. An inter national
computer search was run through the National Marrow Donor Program.
No luck.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't stop Joe or his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I need to do with my time now,'' he says, ``is get more
people to register as potential donors.''

PARK LOSES CONTROL OF BREAKING BALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After winning 11 consecutive games at Dodger
Stadium, Chan Ho Park has dropped his last two, including
Saturday's 5-3 loss to the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Park was National League Pitcher of the Month after going 4-0 in
July. He was 9-0 in his last two Julys, but suddenly he has allowed
11 earned runs in his last 20 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Glenn Hoffman said Park never had control of his
breaking ball, which resulted in a career-high six walks in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a lot of pitches early in the game and by the fifth
he was around 104,'' said Hoffman, who pulled Park after 115
pitches. ``He didn't have the command we're used to seeing from
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Park walked Chipper Jones in the first inning before Andres
Galarraga hit a three-run homer. He walked Michael Tucker with two
outs in the sixth, and Jones doubled him home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The walks killed me,'' Park said. ``I hurt the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke struggles: Gary Sheffield is expected to return tonight
after missing two starts with a sore right thumb. That will mean
some much-needed days off for Matt Luke, who is 1 for 12 on the
homestand. After striking out four times Friday, he struck out two
more times Saturday before being lifted for a pinch hitter,
Sheffield, who grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Since his average peaked at .337 on July 4, Luke has gone 12 for
85 (.141).
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been great in batting practice, but there is a big
difference between batting practice and the real thing,'' hitting
instructor Mickey Hatcher said. ``He is trying really hard,
probably too hard. But it is something you go through. He hasn't
played a lot and he wants to succeed, but sometimes you do get a
little overexposed. They have made adjustments on him. Now it is
his turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Young is hot: Eric Young went 2 for 5, extending his hitting
streak to seven games (.481, 13 for 27). He singled and scored in
the first and homered in the fifth, his first since June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Young is now 13 for 31 on the homestand, including a four-hit
game against Florida last Tuesday. He entered the game with a .367
on-base percentage and has a .335 (58 for 173) average in his last
46 games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's home run cut the Braves' lead to 4-3, but the Dodgers
never got closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stayed in control,'' Young said. ``(John) Smoltz was
still throwing well. They never lost control of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Mark Grudzielanek, who committed a league-high 24
errors in 118 games for Montreal, has just one in his first 14
games with the Dodgers. ``We've been working on his footwork more
than his glove,'' third-base coach Joey Amalfitano said. ``Footwork
is such a big part about playing the infield.'' . . . Catcher
Charles Johnson was given the day game off after catching Friday
night. He is 0 for 10 lifetime against Smoltz. Tom Prince started
and went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts. It was his first appearance
on the homestand. He went 1 for 12 on the last trip and is batting
.164 (12 for 61). . . . The Dodgers' last victory over the Braves
was July 20, 1997 (eight games).
