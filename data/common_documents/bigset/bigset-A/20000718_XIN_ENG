BERLIN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Tiffeny Milbrett scored a lone goal
to pace the United States for a 1-0 victory over Norway in the
opening game of the German Football Federation (DFB) Jubilee
tournament in Osnabrueck, Germany Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Milbrett took a pass about 40 yards from the goal, raced around
a defender and scored from 12 yards out, helping the United States
for two consecutive wins against Norway after losing twice in
February.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Norway still leads the United States 13-12 in the series
with one tie, and the two teams will meet on September 15 at
Melbourne, Australia in the first round of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The game also marked the 200th cap for both Mia Hamm and
Kristine Lilly.
</P>
<P>
Norway turned up the pressure during the last 15 minutes
against the American women who intended on protecting their lead,
with midfielder Hege Riise in particular, as she became one of the
best midfielders in the world.
</P>
<P>
In another game, China defeated Germany 3-1 and will face the
United States on Wednesday in Gottingen.

<HEADLINE> Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria to Step Up Anti-crime Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria
have agreed to strengthen cooperation in combating organized cross-
border crimes, the Albanian news agency ATA reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting in the resort city of Ohrid, southern
Macedonia, the interior ministers of the three countries agreed to
make joint efforts in cracking down on organized crimes of various
forms and carrying out common security measures.
</P>
<P>
The ministers called for substantiated tripartite cooperation,
saying it should not stay on paper or become lip service.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Albanian Interior Minister Spartak Poci and
his Macedonian counterpart, Dosta Dimovska, signed a cooperation
accord providing for stepped-up border checks to prevent entry of
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a similar document was signed between Albania and
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, border areas between the three southeastern
European countries have served as a major transit route for
illegal drugs and immigrants destined for western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Poci stressed that the campaign against drug-smuggling and
illegal immigration in the region needs not only strengthened
cooperation among Albania, Bulgaria and Macedonia, but also
collaboration with neighboring Greece, Turkey and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Legally Blind Runyan Makes U.S. Olympic Track Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Marla Runyan, a legally blind
since she was nine, is on the U.S. Olympic team after taking third
in the women's 1,500 meters at the U.S. Olympic track and field
trials in Sacramento, California on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," said Runyan who finished third at 4 minutes 06.
44 seconds, behind winner Regina Jacobs in 4:01.01 and runner-up
Suzy Favor Hamilton 4:01.81.
</P>
<P>
A heptathlete at the U.S. Olympic trials in 1996, Runyan
becomes the first legally blind member of the U.S. Olympic team,
but she thinks of herself as an athlete first.
</P>
<P>
"I never think about my vision as much as the media does," said
Runyan, 31, who has macular degeneration, 20/300 vision and see
peripherally. "And I don't think my competitors do, either. My
vision is just a circumstance. I never really looked at it as a
barrier. I never said to myself I wanted to be the first legally
blind Olympian. I just said I wanted to be on an Olympic team."
</P>
<P>
Runyan had a clear strategy. "I was running for third," said
Runyan who finished ahead of Shayne Culpepper as the latter
clocked in 4:08.38.
</P>
<P>
Runyan was too injured to run for a month until a week ago, and
most of her training since June 9 has been in the pool or on an
elliptical running machine as she had had problems with her left
iliotibial band, which runs along the outside of the leg from hip
to knee.
</P>
<P>
Runyan spent about two weeks at the Olympic Training Center in
Colorado Springs for treatment. She did light track workouts in
the past week.
</P>
<P>
"She's a remarkable woman," said her coach Mike Manley, "She
has a tremendous physical gift, but she also has the mental
strength to overcome problems and focus on what she needs to do to
get where she wants."

<HEADLINE> Jordanians to Seek Signature on Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian Professional
Association (JPA) will seek 2 million signatures to reject any
compensation or resettlement for Palestinian refugees and call for
their return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Association sources said here Tuesday that the JPA, grouping
doctors, lawyers, engineers and other professionals, is also
planning a march to protest against the ongoing summit between U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at David Camp near Washington.
</P>
<P>
The trilateral summit is mainly focusing on Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, borders and water, the thorniest issues
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the JPA, known for its staunch anti-Israeli
stand, issued a sharply-worded statement against the three-day
summit, calling for a jihad (holy war) to liberate Palestinian
territories in stead of "holding negotiations in light of weakened
Arab positions and limitations imposed on Palestinian negotiators."
</P>
<P>
The JPA is apparently afraid that the David Camp summit will end
up with an agreement that falls short of taking into consideration
Jordan's interests, particularly on the Palestinian refugee issue.
</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly said it was ready to allow 75,000
Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland, while the
remainder of the refugees would receive international aid and
settle down in countries where they are living now.
</P>
<P>
There are some 4.5 million Palestinians living in Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon and other Arab countries, as a result of the successive
Middle East wars since the creation of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is now hosting some 1.5 million Palestinian refugees,
most of them have been given Jordanian citizenship, but the
government supports their rights to choose between returning home
or staying in Jordan while asking for compensation from parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming
the second Arab country after Egypt to realize peace with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-Israel sentiment could be easily felt among
Jordanians, over 60 percent of whom are of Palestinian origins.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Qatar Call for Broadening Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Qatar on Tuesday called for
broadening cooperation among Persian Gulf littoral countries in
order to promote stability and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran as a regional power is ready to cooperate with the
countries of the region and those countries can also count on Iran,
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said in a meeting with
visiting Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
He said that with mutual cooperation, the stability and security
of the Gulf region will be realized, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi mentioned the "hostilities and cold war" between Iran
and its Gulf Arab neighbors following the 1979 Islamic revolution,
but stressed that all those differences and suspicions should be
put behind and the countries should extend hands toward "mutual
cooperation and collaboration."
</P>
<P>
The Qatar emir, for his part, underlined his country's
willingness to broaden ties with Iran in various fields, especially
gas and petrochemical.
</P>
<P>
He said that Qatar and Iran have always enjoyed very good and
progressive relations and constructive cooperation between the two
countries will further lead to positive and beneficial results in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hamad also met with Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani on military cooperation between Iran and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Hamad said that Doha is ready to appoint a
military attache to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani, for his part, called for promotion of Iran-Qatar
defense ties by exchange of military delegations and defense
expertise and expansion of cooperation in training.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir arrived here on Monday for a two-day official
visit. He had also held separate meetings with Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami and the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, a series of cooperation agreements were signed
between the two countries on such issues as encouraging investments
by avoiding double taxation, increasing cultural contacts,
exchanging know-how in the medical field, exchanging news services
and increasing Iran-Qatar flights.
</P>
<P>
After years of mutual suspicion caused mainly by previous
Iranian governments' policy of exporting the 1979 Islamic
revolution, Iran and its Gulf Arab neighbors have improved ties in
recent years, especially since President Khatami took office in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami paid landmark visits to Saudi Arabia and Qatar in April
1999, which opened a new chapter for their relations.

<HEADLINE> Albright Cancels Trip to London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has cancelled a planned trip to London as the
Middle East Summit in Camp David entered its final phase on
Tuesday, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters that Albright had been
due to fly to London Tuesday night and speak to a lawyers'
conference in the British capital.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that President Bill Clinton was still planning to
travel to Japan on Wednesday to attend a Group of Eight nations
summit.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton was scheduled to depart aboard a helicopter at
8:40 a.m. EDT (1240 GMT) on Wednesday, then leave Dulles
International Airport aboard Air Force One for Tokyo at 9:10 a.m.
EDT (1310 GMT).
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said that the accompanying press plane, which
had been due to leave on Tuesday evening, has been postponed until
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the press flight was delayed because the
White House did not want reporters to miss any possible
announcement on the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The press plane is delayed until tomorrow morning so White
House people are not in the air 10 hours from some place when we
come out and say something," Lockhart said at a temporary media
center set up in an elementary school near Camp David, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that Clinton, who has been shuttling to mediate
between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat for the past week, worked until 5 a.m. (0900 GMT)
and resumed consultations with his advisors on Tuesday morning
before meeting again with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Due to a strict news blackout imposed on the summit, the
spokesman refused to comment on the substance of the talks.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran Military Ask for Discussion on Base Used by U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the Ecuadoran Air Force
(FAE) General Oswaldo Dominguez said Tuesday the treaty for use of
Manta Air Base by U.S. military men must be discussed publicly.
</P>
<P>
On his part, delegate of the National Congress Leon Roldos
requested revision of the treaty for use of Manta Air Base, signed
in November 1999 between Ecuador and the United States because the
treaty wasn't explained at that time to a full Congress.
</P>
<P>
Roldos said the previous government's decision to grant
American troops use of Manta Air Base, situated on Ecuador's
northwest coast, was and is inadmissible and undue. He argued that
other Latin American countries have refused to allow American
military bases on their land.
</P>
<P>
According to Roldos, Manta Air Base means to be, in some way,
alternative for Panama Base.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Colonel Lucio Gutierrez, leader of the military
uprising on January 21, said Ecuador doesn't obtain any benefit
from the accord signed with the United States and, on the contrary,
could have unpredictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorians don't obtain any benefits from this covenant but
tens of thousands of displaced from Colombia who'll pass the
border, said the retired colonel.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Firm to Buy France Telecom in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch leading telecoms
service KPN Telecom was garnering money to fund a buy-out of its
Belgian joint venture with France Telecom, local press reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch firm confirmed that it took interest in buying the 50-
percent stake it does not own of the Belgian mobile phone operator
KPN Orange.
</P>
<P>
"It is logical," said KPN spokesman Marinus Potman, "that we
are interested in the stake but we have no definite plans yet."
</P>
<P>
The ownership of KPN Orange has been in doubt since France
Telecom snapped up Orange in June.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources said on Tuesday that a loan is in the works
though the Amsterdam-based KPN Telecom did not confirm that it had
secured the loan.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources also said that the loan could be used to
finance KPN's investment in the third-generation mobile phone
services in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands and could also be
used in financing KPN's payment to its Hong Kong partner Hutchison
Whampoa.
</P>
<P>
KPN has forged an alliance with Hutchison and Japan's NTT
DoCoMo to help expand mobile phone services in four of Europe's
third-generation mobile phone markets.
</P>
<P>
The three companies have planned to jointly bid for third-
generation, broadband Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
licenses in Germany, France, Belgium and possibly Italy.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate passed a "marriage
penalty" bill by a vote of 60-39 Tuesday that would cut 248
billion dollars in tax over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is the centerpiece of the 792 billion dollars
Republican tax cut that Clinton vetoed last year, now heads for
negotiations between the House and Senate on a final measure that
could go to President Clinton for signature this week.
</P>
<P>
Republicans want the president to sign it before the party's
national political convention begins July 31 in Philadelphia to
draw public attention to their differences with Democrats on tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
"We will see who supports marriage-tax relief, and we will see
who thinks American families are not entitled to this relief,"
said Republican Senator William Roth, the Senate Finance Committee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said he could sign the measure into law only under
the condition that Congress also send him a bill creating a
prescription drug benefit in the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
Two single people enjoy wider tax brackets than a comparable
married couple in the U.S., resulting in an average tax bill 1,400
dollars higher for 25 million couples.

<HEADLINE> Bidding for Dutch UMTS Licenses Reaches 1.7 Bln Guilders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Bidding for the Dutch auction of
five third-generation mobile phone service licenses reached 1.7
billion Dutch guilders (721 million U.S. dollars) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Telfort and KPN Mobile were the top bidders for licenses A and
B, with Telfort bid being 673.4 million guilders for license A of
the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and KPN
Mobile bid being 672.7 million guilders for license B.
</P>
<P>
The bids surpassed the opening prices offered by the Dutch
government at 470 million guilders (202 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The licenses on offer will entitle holders to use allocated
frequencies for the provision of services until December 31, 2016.
The UMTS services turn mobile telephones into multimedia devices.
</P>
<P>
UMTS stands for universal mobile telecommunications standard,
the newest generation of cellular phone service. UMTS boasts of a
transmission speed 40 times faster than that of the existing GSM
standard.
</P>
<P>
The higher telecommunication speed makes possible new
capabilities such as mobile phone connection to the Internet and
video displays.
</P>
<P>
Eight companies have been allowed into the Dutch auction,
including five already having established telecoms services in the
Netherlands. The bidders were KPN Mobile, Libertel, Telfort,
Dutchtone, Ben, Nogenta Swedish Acquisition, Hutchison 3G
Netherlands and VersaTel.
</P>
<P>
KPN Mobile and Libertel are the largest and second largest
mobile phone operators in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
But two contenders, Nogenta Swedish Acquisition and Ben,
withdrew from the auction.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Treasury has canceled a July bond issue because of
anticipated UMTS license revenues.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is the second European country after Britain to
have auctioned UMTS licenses. In April, the British government got
22.5 billion pounds (34 billion dollars) from the auction sales of
five UMTS licenses, more than five times the sum previously
expected.

<P>
ABU DHABI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Emirates, the leading airline
company of the United Arab Emirates, has signed a contract with the
European aviation giant Airbus Industries for the purchase of three
additional Airbus A330 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The contract will raise the total number of A330s Emirates has

</P>
<P>
The three A330s will be delivered in November and December this

</P>
<P>
Emirates is Airbus Industries' largest Middle East customer. It

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Hungarian bus manufacturer Ikarus has appealed to the
Turkish authorities to support a joint venture in the bus
production in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ikarus' Turkey-desk manager Erzebet Loczy said although Turkey
is an important market, Ikarus cannot sell buses there due to stiff
competition from Asian companies and a major disadvantage in prices
despite good quality.
</P>
<P>
He said this could be overcome by producing the buses in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's first nuclear power plant project will
probably be postponed for a long time amid controversy between the
government and the bidding consortia.
</P>
<P>
The Energy and Natural Resources Ministry should select the
winning consortium by July 24. However, the announcement is set to
be put off for at least another year due to the Treasury's
reluctance to provide guarantees for the financing of the 5-
billion-U.S. dollar plant to be built in Akkuyu in the southern
province of Mersin.
</P>
<P>
But bidders would not accept another delay, warning to withdraw
their bids in case of another postponement.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Increasing poverty and the erosion of purchasing power
in Turkey are attracting greater attention as the government's
anti-inflation program puts extraordinary pressure on wages and
farm produce prices.
</P>
<P>
Unequal income distribution and low growth rates are also shown
as the basic reasons for the fragility of the Turkish economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that there are 20 million people living
below the poverty line, with 5 million of these suffering from
hunger.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shochat announced
on Monday plans to continue reducing purchase taxes on electrical
appliances. Shochat refused to mention any figures for the promised
reductions or to say what highly-taxed electrical appliances will
be included in his plans.
</P>
<P>
Current purchase taxes range from 30 percent to 55 percent on
large home appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and
stoves and between 65 percent to 85 percent on luxury items and
home entertainment equipment such as dishwashers, stereos and video
recorders.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Postal Authority has issued a tender
for a computer company to devise a program that will enable it to
sell stamps via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that the authority will complete preparations
to sell stamps via an Internet site by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
A program is being developed that will allow customers to
download stamps from the authority's web site after paying for them
via credit card, print them out on a home printer and stick them on
the envelopes.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Bank of Israel issued a report on Monday
calling for increasing the minimum wage by adopting standards for
the calculation of such salaries.
</P>
<P>
It noted that over 50 percent of employers surveyed pay their
workers less than the minimum wage, currently 2,798 shekels (about
700 dollars). The sum is updated on April 1 each year, based on 47.
5 percent of the average salary.
</P>
<P>
One of the recommendations raised is to automatically link
salaries to the consumer price index, which would maintain their
real value. Another option is to link the minimum wage to the
median salary.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish company, Ezinc Metal Sanayi A.S., which is
based in central Kayseri province, is exporting solar collectors to
European and African countries.
</P>
<P>
Ezinc Metal Sanayi A.S. Deputy General Director, Hakan Alas,
told reporters Tuesday that they had exported 1.3 million dollars
worth of copper and aluminium solar collectors to Spain, Italy,
France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Egypt, Libya,
Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Jordan in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
Alas said that they plan to increase their solar collectors
exports to 3 million dollars by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Introduce Tougher Traffic Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian authorities will introduce
tougher traffic laws, including a maximum fine of 1,400 U.S.
dollars on a traffic law violator, to reduce road accidents in the
kingdom, police said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new laws are expected to go into effect on August 1 with the
most severe fines to be imposed on hit-and-run drivers, those
driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol or transporting
poisonous or explosive materials without proper authorization.
</P>
<P>
The maximum fine for a traffic wrongdoer will be increased to 1,
000 Jordanian dinars( 1,400 dollars) from the current 50 dinars (70
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new measures are part of the efforts by the government to
curb the alarming rate of road accidents, which claimed 612 lives
in 1999 alone in the kingdom with a population of 4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Officials blamed the leading causes of the accidents on
ignorance of traffic laws, speeding, wrongful overtaking, poor
driving habits, driving under the influence of alcohol and poor
vehicle conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, critics blamed the government for poor road
construction and maintenance and the police are also criticized for
failing to implement traffic laws to the letter.

UNITED NATIONS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
announced Tuesday a Nigerian peacekeeper in Sierra Leone was
killed by rebels from the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) when
his patrol came under fire.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place Sunday near Rogberi Junction in
western Sierra Leone but his body was not recovered until Monday,
the U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said here.
</P>
<P>
The president of the U.N. Security Council, Patricia Durrant
of Jamaica, read a statement to the press here that Council
members expressed condolences to the family of the Nigerian
soldier and the Nigerian Government.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said that there was no evidence to suggest the
incident was a retaliatory move for the weekend operation in which
Indian, Ghanaian and Nigerian soldiers rescued 233 U.N.
peacekeepers who had been encircled by rebels in Kailahun, the RUF
stronghold in eastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said that uprooted civilian fleeing the rebels were
suffering from a lack of water and poor sanitation conditions near
the town of Mile 91, east of the capital Freetown, where some 60,
000 people were gathered.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Food Program is distributing food and trying to find
new campsites, he said.

<HEADLINE> Trial Hears New Evidence on Lockerbie Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Special Scottish court in the
Netherlands for the Lockerbie bombing case heard Tuesday from
witnesses that two Libyans accused of the attack flew to Malta
just the day before the blast of Pan Am flight 103 on December 21,
1988.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors at the court say the Libyan men in Malta loaded a
bomb to be transferred onto the doomed flight. During Tuesday's
testimony, prosecutor Alan Turnbull showed four Scottish judges
presiding over the special court immigration cards for flights
from Tripoli to Malta dated December 20, 1988, in the names of
Lamen Khalifa Fimah and Ahmed Khalifa Abdusamad.
</P>
<P>
The indictment against Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima and Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi, who are charged with planting the bomb that blasted
the Pan Am flight over Scottish town Lockerbie, says Megrahi was
using a false passport in the name of Abdusamad.
</P>
<P>
The other immigration card showed a man traveling as Abdusamad
returned to Tripoli on December 21, 1988, when all 259 passengers
on board the Pan Am flight 103 and 11 Lockerbie residents were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution says the two defendants adopted the cover of
Libyan Arab Airlines employees at Luqa airport in Malta to hide a
bomb inside a Toshiba radio cassette recorder in a suitcase with
stolen Air Malta tags on a flight to Frankfurt, to be transferred
there onto the target flight.
</P>
<P>
Located in Camp Zeist, about 50 kilometers from Amsterdam, the
court also heard from two Toshiba employees, who said their firm
had delivered 20,000 Bombeat RT-SF 16 units to Libya in October
1988.
</P>
<P>
Forensic experts told the trial last month they had gathered
shards of such a model to show what type of bomb was used. Former
Toshiba manager Yoshihiro Miura said Tuesday that almost 80
percent of those models were delivered to Libya.
</P>
<P>
The trial was adjourned early the day until Wednesday morning
to give the defence time to digest five new files related to
Frankfurt airport, the next stage of evidence. The files came from
U.S. civil cases related to the Lockerbie affair.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial started May 3 this year and is expected to
last over one year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands on Tuesday
launched an online finance service for Internet-based consumers
with the tie-up between a Dutch bank and a Dutch telecoms firm.
</P>
<P>
ABN AMRO, the Netherlands' biggest bank, and KPN Telecom, the
country's leading telecoms service, joined hands in offering
Internet-based financial services to consumers, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The two will invest between 150 million and 200 million euro(
140 million-187 million U.S. dollars) in the first two years of
joint venture and the online finance firm, known as Money Planet,
will initially serve consumers in neighboring Belgium and Germany
as well as in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The services to be offered include current accounts, stock
brokerage, mortgages, insurance and investment funds.
</P>
<P>
The new firm hoped to attract at least 1 million clients and be
profitable within four years of operation starting in early 2001.
</P>
<P>
The two parent groups hoped that Money Planet would be well
placed to compete in the online financial market which they
estimated to be worth 19 billion euro (18 billion dollars) in the
three start-up countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Support Debt Relief for Benin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday agreed to support a
debt relief package for Benin under the enhanced Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
</P>
<P>
Total relief from all of Benin's creditors is worth around 460
million U.S. dollars, according to statements from the two lending
institutions.
</P>
<P>
In net present value (NPV) terms, the value of the relief was
estimated at 265 million dollars, or 31 percent of the total NPV
of the western African country's debt outstanding at end-1998
after the full use of traditional debt relief mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's International Development Association (IDA)
and the IMF will start providing interim debt relief by August 1,
2000. The IMF will contribute 24.3 million dollars to the package
and the IDA 124.3 million dollars over the full life of Benin's
debts.
</P>
<P>
Under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, countries with a
satisfactory track record of macroeconomic and structural policy
implementation and a NPV of external debt exceeding 150 percent of
exports are eligible to receive debt relief.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, Benin's debt-to-export ratio was 218
percent. With overall debt relief of 265 million dollars, that
ratio will be brought down to 150 percent by 2011 and under 100
percent in the ensuing years.
</P>
<P>
Benin will receive the remainder of its debt relief from all
its creditors once it drafts what is known in HIPC terms as a "
poverty reduction strategy paper", a document expected to be
completed by April 2001, according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
To date, nine countries, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Honduras,
Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda, are
receiving, or are about to receive, debt relief from the World
Bank and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also approved Tuesday a three-year arrangement for
Benin under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility in a total
of 35.7 million dollars to support the government's 2000-03
economic program.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the program are to achieve real gross
domestic product (GDP) growth of 5-6 percent and contain inflation
below 3 percent. The country's real GDP growth was estimated to
have risen to about 5 percent in 1999 from 4.5 percent in 1998,
and was projected to increase to 5.6 percent in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Saudi-Kuwait Maritime Border Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq fully rejects the maritime
border deal between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as it "does not respect
Iraq's legitimate rights," an Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will not recognize any demarcation of a maritime border
that does not take into consideration Iraq's legitimate rights,"
the spokesman said in a statement carried by the official Iraqi
News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait signed the maritime border deal on July
2 over the demarcation of maritime border of the Gulf waterway and
through the Dorra gas field which is claimed by Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The deal would enable Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to take a common
stand in negotiating with Iran in dividing the area's rich oil and
gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, as one of the Gulf countries, shares maritime borders with
both Kuwait and Iran, said the spokesman, adding that any maritime
border deal "neglecting Iraq's legitimate rights" is not binding on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
have been frozen since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
triggered the 1991 Gulf War to drive Iraqi occupation troops out of
Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed and 16 others
injured in Egypt on Tuesday in a road accident involving a lorry
and two mini-buses.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place on the road linking Cairo and Assiut,
330 kilometers south of the capital, when a front tire of the lorry
punctured, said a statement issued by the Ministry of Interior.
</P>
<P>
The lorry veered and crashed head-on into a mini-bus, and
another following immediately ran into the wrecked vehicles, the
state-run MENA news agency reported, quoting the statement.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the lorry, 28, was killed in the incident, the
statement said. But no details were given to the identities of the
other eight who perished in the accident.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt, blamed on violation of
traffic rules and reckless driving, and often cause major loss of
lives as vehicles are mostly crammed. In the most recent accident,
19 people were killed and 15 others injured on Monday when a mini-
bus ran head-on into a car in southern Minya Governorate.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, U.S. to Explore for Off-shore Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The state-run Turkish Petroleum
Corp. (TPAO) and a U.S. oil company El Paso Energy will explore for
natural gas in the southern Iskenderun and Mersin gulfs.
</P>
<P>
TPAO and El Paso will sign a partnership agreement in Ankara on
Wednesday, reported the semi-official Anatolia News Agency on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The pact is expected to be signed by Osman Demirag, chairman of
TPAO Executive Board and general director, and John B. Holmes,
director of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the draft agreement, TPAO and El Paso will
carry out seismic research in shallow and deep waters in Mersin and
Iskenderun gulfs in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, El Paso sealed an agreement with German-Italian partner
Geo Prakla company for the seismic researches that will be launched
in August.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that El Paso will collect deep-sea seismic data in
Iskenderun and Mersin gulfs. If necessary, the dimensions of the
researches will be increased.
</P>
<P>
The data acquired in the seismic research foreseen to be
concluded by the end of 2000, will be estimated by El Paso.
</P>
<P>
Two wells in Mersin and Iskenderun gulfs will be drilled in July
2001. The number of wells can be increased in accordance with the
results of seismic researches.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are signs indicating natural gas
deposits in the sea off the coast.
</P>
<P>
El Paso will spend at least 20 million U.S. dollars for two
wells and if no natural gas or oil are determined, TPAO and El Paso
will share the expenditures of further operations, according to the
draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
El Paso wants to produce electricity by constructing a station
in the region if natural gas is found in Iskenderun and Mersin
gulfs.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, poor in fossil fuels, largely relies on imports from
oil- and natural gas-producing countries to meet the ever-growing
domestic demand for energy.

<HEADLINE> Large Families in Israel Closer to Receive More Allowances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Labor and Welfare Committee
of Israeli parliament Tuesday endorsed, amid heat debate, more
child allowances for families with five or more children, pushing
the large-family bill further on the way to becoming law.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill that already passed the preliminary and first
readings in the Knesset (parliament) and needs two more readings to
become law, from the fifth child on, each kid can get 250 shekels
(about 60 U.S. dollars) more child allowances to raise the total
sum to 850 shekels (about 200 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The birth grant for mothers who gave birth to more than five
children will also increase.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the committee scrapped an original clause in
the bill calling for big discounts in municipal taxes for families
of five children or more. It also dropped the proposal to extend
child allowances from the current age of 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chair David Tal from the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party
said the bill is a step toward better social status for large
families. "This is not a bill for any one sector. I believe it is a
good bill for all the citizens of Israel."
</P>
<P>
The bill met strong opposition from treasury officials who said
that the bill could cost 480 million shekels (about 120 million
dollars) out of the strained state budget.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Paritzky from the secular Shinui Party charged that the
ultra-Orthodox Party and their Knesset members are pushing the bill
for the big families in their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
"They now pass the law in the committee to be prepared for the
second and third readings in the parliament that will take from the
tax payers, from parents who work with one child, two children,
three children, from parents who contribute to this country by
serving in the army, by sending their children to the army, half a
billion shekels only to produce children," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an outrageous law. It is a disgrace to the parliament,
that such a law has been put on the table, not to mention the fact
that it passed the first reading." Paritzky said.
</P>
<P>
The large-family bill has aroused strong reaction in the Israeli
society. The most papular Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot said in
an earlier editorial that despite the fact the bill was intended as
an egalitarian arrangement to improve the financial status of all
families, every intelligent person knows that its true
beneficiaries are ultra-Orthodox families which typically have many
children.
</P>
<P>
The paper cautioned that if the bill is passed, the
discrimination against secular families, which usually have no more
than three children will be even greater.
</P>
<P>
The editor slammed the legislators from the Shas, the third
largest party with 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset, as
exploiting their political strength to squeeze more and more from
the public coffer on behalf of voters who contribute nothing to it.

<HEADLINE> Arab FMs to Meet to Finalize Details on Regular Summits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of five Arab
countries will meet early September to discuss a mechanism for the
holding an Arab summit on a regular basis, Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen,
which form a committee in charge of handling the issue, will meet
on September 2 to finalize the details, including the venue and
timing of the proposed regular summit, Abdel-Meguid said in an
interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will submit their proposals to the 114th session
of the league's Foreign Ministers Council on September 3. The
council is expected to adopt the proposals.
</P>
<P>
Despite frequent talks about regular summits, aimed at seeking
common stands on key issues related to the Arab world, only one
summit has been held since the 1991 Gulf War, which was prompted by
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The meeting, held in Cairo in 1996,
excluded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
During its meeting early last month, the five-way committee
proposed a summit on yearly basis in March next year.

<HEADLINE> Former Inspector Claims Iraq Back to Make Mass-Destruction Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A controversial former U.N. chief
inspector said here Tuesday that Iraq is back in the business of
making weapons of mass destruction. However, he admitted that he
has no hard evidence to support the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, former head of the now defunct United Nations
Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM), made the remarks to Israel
Radio after a meeting in the Israeli Knesset (parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
There is evidence "to the effect" that Iraq, now "awash with
money," is reproducing biological, chemical weapons again, said the
Australian, who was accused by Iraq of helping plant United States
spies in his inspection teams in charge of disarming Iraq of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Butler left the UNSCOM in June, 1999 after his contract expired.
</P>
<P>
He admitted, however, that because the inspection had been
suspended since the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night
Operation Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq in December 1998, he
has no concrete evidence for his claims.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is also collecting uranium for making nuclear weapons and
it will have nuclear warheads within 12 months if it has relevant
materials, claimed Butler, who is now a diplomat in residence at
the Council of Foreign Relations in New York.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told him, while
he was still involved in the disarming of Iraq, that Iraq has
biological weapons "dealing with the Zionist entity (Israel)."
</P>
<P>
The successful launching of long-range Shahab-3 missile last
Saturday by Iran, with whom Iraq fought a bloody war in 1980-1988,
will only stir up Iraq's ambition to produce more mass-destruction
weapons to counteract the military development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Butler appealed to the United Nations Security Council to stop
Iraq form producing biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
(UNMOVIC), which replaced the UNSCOM later last year, has yet to
begin its fieldwork in Iraq as Iraq refused to cooperate with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards Iraq as a major threat in the region. During the
1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait a year
earlier, Iraq launched Scud missiles against Israeli targets but
caused no casualties.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A small explosive device went
off after 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday at Cape Town International Airport,
South Africa, causing minor damage but no injuries.
</P>
<P>
Airport manager Hennie Taljaard said staff initially thought
it was thunder, but further investigation found a small explosive
device had detonated in a dustbin between the international and
domestic departure halls.
</P>
<P>
Taljaard said no one was injured, nor were any cars parked
nearby damaged in any way. Initial reports that the explosion was
the result of a car bomb were discounted.
</P>
<P>
Police closed off both roads leading to the airport after the
explosion while bomb squad members sifted through the debris and
checked for further devices. Police believed that the blast was
linked with urban "terrorists".
</P>
<P>
These "terrorists" were attempting to ward off tourists,
Western Cape safety and security official Mark Wiley said.
</P>
<P>
He said there were 180 surveillance cameras at the airport and
police were studying the tapes for evidence.
</P>
<P>
All flights were reportedly running as scheduled and no delays
were anticipated.

<HEADLINE> Poverty, AIDS Worsen Children's Situation in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The general situation for Kenyan
children has been worsened in the past ten years due to poverty
and AIDS problems, according to a U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
"The under-five mortality rate has increased from 99 per 1000
live births in 1994 to 117 per 1,000 live births in 1998," the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Representative to Kenya
Nicholas Alipui said Tuesday while officially launching the UNICEF
's annual report The Progress of Nations 2000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, malnutrition continues to plague Kenyan children at
a high rate of between 22 percent to 37 percent despite the
promise that children would thrive and grow to their maximum
potential through good nutrition, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
"Kenya has made commendable efforts but those have been
insufficient since we can not report progress in any of these
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that rapidly increasing poverty, a rapidly
growing HIV/AIDS crisis and a rapidly expanding drought emergency
are major causes for the plight of Kenyan children.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is increasing mortality among children and young adults
and is likely to reduce life expectancy drastically in Kenya
unless stopped now," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The response to the epidemic should be on many fronts --
through information, education, empowerment of women and girls,
communication, practice and behavior change on the part of
individuals as well as society at large, he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A visiting official from the
European Union (EU) said in Rwandan capital Tuesday that Rwanda
has made some progress in its democratization process, according
to a report by Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize a change in the democratization process in Rwanda
manifested in the local government general elections held last
year, where people had to line-up behind candidates of their own
choice and this year's elections of the county chiefs where the
secret ballot shall be employed," EU's special representative to
the Great Lakes region Aldo Ayello told a press conference held
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ayello said, "For us, the democratization process is not a '
recipe' that we are trying to sell to our African friends. Our
idea is that democracy in Africa should follow their history,
culture, traditional, economical and social situation and even
ethnic composition of each country."
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy highlighted the pillars of democracy that the EU
is committed to, which include the right of the people to choose
leaders through general elections, the separation of judiciary,
legislative and executive powers and a protecting system of human
rights and fundamental freedom.
</P>
<P>
The envoy's visit to Rwanda is aimed at evaluating the
democratization process in Rwanda, the performance of its Justice
sector and the peaceful resolution of the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo,

<HEADLINE> Liberia Discusses Border Issues With Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Liberia has renewed border talks
with neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea, the News Agency of
Nigeria reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a senior Liberian government official as
saying that the meeting of the Mano River Union Security Council,
kicked off Monday evening, came after the recent border raids by
Liberian dissidents from Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone and Liberia set up the Mano River Union in 1973 to
boost bilateral cooperation between the two countries and Guinea
joined the union later.
</P>
<P>
Liberia and Sierra Leone have since then been ravaged by civil
wars and mutual suspicion has dominated the relationship between
the two west African countries.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone accuses Liberia of supporting the rebel
Revolutionary United Front by engaging in diamond-for-armament
business, while Liberia accuse Sierra Leone and Guinea of
harboring its dissidents.

<HEADLINE> Agreement on Jerusalem Near Completion: Israeli Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians are
on the verge of reaching an agreement on Jerusalem at the Camp
David summit in the United States, Israel Radio reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem is one of the key issues in the Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks. Israel has insisted that the city is its "
eternal and united capital," while the Palestinians said they will
declare an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted an Israeli source in Washington as saying that
the Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams have spent a lot of
time on Tuesday discussing the Jerusalem issue and are about to
reach an agreement on this most difficult problem.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Israel would take full control of the city
and its surrounding areas while granting the Palestinians control
of the Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The surrounding areas include the settlements of Ma'ale Adumim
in the east of the city, Givat Ze'ev in the northwest and Gush
Etsyon southwest of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
But the report quoted a Palestinian source as saying that
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who is at Camp David with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton, has made
it clear from the beginning of the summit that East Jerusalem
should be put under full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders held lengthy meetings Tuesday to try to work
out a framework agreement on all the key issues of the Israeli-
Palestinian final-status talks, which also include borders,
refugees and Jewish settlements, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Knesset (parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg said here
Tuesday that Israel could reach the framework agreement with the
Palestinians at the Camp David summit, but the outcome might not be
clear until the last minute.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Ehud Barak's mood is very cautious but
determined as the Camp David summit enters its decisive state,"
Burg said.
</P>
<P>
"I would say it is the highest motivation I have ever seen in
any Israeli leader to make such a risky breakthrough in order to
bring peace for the people of Israel and the Palestinians," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"In Israel, usually the best solutions come at the last
minute, ...with the Palestinian side, they are coming sometimes
even after the last moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which began last Tuesday, is aimed at working out a
framework agreement on key issues ahead of the September target for
a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said the peace talks at the summit had
been escalated on Tuesday due to Clinton's anticipated departure
for Japan to attend the ecomonic summit of the Group of Eight,
which comprises the seven richest countries plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his advisors are pressing the Israeli and
Palestinian sides to reach a framework agreement before his
departure Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement or declaration is not reached by then, the two
sides could decide whether to suspend the talk or to continue at
Camp David and wait for Clinton's return.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Opposition Protests Against High Living Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 18 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka's main opposition United
National Party (UNP) Tuesday held here a mammoth protest march
against the rising cost of living.
</P>
<P>
An estimated crowd of over 10,000 people gathered near one of
Colombo's main railway stations creating a massive traffic block.
</P>
<P>
A party spokesman said that many farmers had arrived from
outstations to vent their anger against the rising cost of living
due to the recent depreciation of the country's currency rupee and
the price hike of gas, diesel, electricity and telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the protesting crowd, the UNP Leader Ranil
Wickremesinghe pledged that if elected to power his government
will bring the rising cost of living down and ease the burden on
the poor masses.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Kumaratunga has said that the 11th
Parliament elections will be held during the first week of
November after the current parliament is dissolved on August 24.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise 0.6 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices jumped 0.6
percent in June, chiefly reflecting surging gasoline prices and a
record rise in the cost of natural gas, the Labor Department
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted advance in the Consumer Price Index,
the most closely watched inflation gauge, came after prices rose
just 0.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
After falling sharply in May, energy prices shot up 5.6 percent
in June, the largest increase since April 1999.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices rose 8.8 percent last month, the biggest
increase since March. Prices for natural gas increased by a record
7.8 percent, surpassing the previous record in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, after rising sharply in May, increased by a slim 0.
1 percent in June as falling prices for fruit, dairy products and
poultry helped blunt rising prices for beef and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the "core"
rate of inflation rose just 0.2 percent in June, for the third
month in a row, suggesting that most other prices were under
control.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, overall consumer prices have been rising at
an annual rate of 4.2 percent, compared with a 2.7 percent
increase for all of last year. The pickup in this year's prices is
mostly a result of rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the last 13 months to slow economic growth and keep inflation in
check.
</P>
<P>
Some economic reports have suggested that the Fed's rate
increases are working to slow economic growth. Given that, some
economists expect the central bank to leave rates unchanged at its
meeting on August 22.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government reported that inflation at the
wholesale level rose a sharp 0.6 percent in June, mostly limited
to soaring energy prices.

<HEADLINE> British PM To Assure Japan on Euro policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will seek to reassure his Japanese counterpart Yoshiro Mori this
week about Britain's policy on the euro currency, Blair's official
spokesman said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Alastair Campbell said Blair would set out Britain's commitment
in principle to join the euro, subject to passing economic tests
and approval in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister will use bilateral talks with Mori in Tokyo
on Thursday to explain his government's euro stance, addressing
fears that some major investors in Britain may switch production
to the eurozone, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes only weeks after Britain's ambassador in
Japan, Stephen Gomersall, warned of disinvestment unless investors
are reassured on the euro policy.
</P>
<P>
A report said Gomersall urged Blair to use his trip to Japan to
offer "tea and sympathy" on the euro policy.
</P>
<P>
Campbell said the two leaders would tackle the euro issue
before they fly to the Group of Eight summit, to be held in
Okinawa, southern Japan, from Friday to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"There isn't a fixed agenda for the Japan bilateral (talks)yet,
" Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
"But in relation to the single currency, (Blair) will take the
opportunity to make sure the Japanese understand what the policy
is. Japanese inward investors understand that position but there's
no harm in the prime minister continuing to set it out," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Electricity Prices Show Downward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Electricity prices showed a
general downward trend across the European Union (EU) in January
this year for both households and industrial consumers compared to
the figures in January 1998, the EU statistical office Eurostat
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the two-year period, electricity prices went down in
most of the EU countries because the bloc's 15 member states have
implemented new market rules since January 1, 1998 to liberalize
electricity markets.
</P>
<P>
Most of EU households, regardless of their volume of
consumption, benefited from a decrease in the price for
electricity between January 1998 and January 2000. According to
Eurostat, households or domestic consumers are broken down into
three categories - small, medium and large consumers.
</P>
<P>
The highest overall decreases in prices were in Finland and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands stood out as the only EU member states where
electricity prices increased for all categories, by respectively
15 percent for small, 5 percent for medium and 4 percent for large
consumers. In Ireland, a significant rise was registered for large
consumers (20 percent) but prices were unchanged for the two other
categories.
</P>
<P>
A special situation arose in Italy: prices for medium and large
domestic consumers went down by around 10 percent but jumped at
the same time by 40 percent for small consumers, as a more
equitable tariff structure was implemented.
</P>
<P>
All the other member states recorded a general and moderate
drop of less than 5 percent, according to Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, industrial consumers in most of the EU countries
also witnessed a decrease in prices. The drop was specially high
in Germany, followed by Sweden, Portugal and Finland.
</P>
<P>
Prices for small industrial consumers also dropped
significantly in the Netherlands and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Greece was the only EU member with an overall price increase of
3 percent over the period.

BERLIN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Host favourite Tommy Haas came
from a six match points to defeat Czech qualifier David Miketa 3-6,
7-5, 6-2 on Tuesday to reach the second round of the Stuttgart
Open, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old German, seeded sixth in the claycourt event,
lost the first set and was 5-4 down in the second but the
unheralded Miketa then wasted his chances to seal the match before
collapsing in the decisive set.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty, the eighth seed, was the first
seeded player to bow out of the tournament, beaten 6-3, 7-5 by
Czech Jiri Novak.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Andrei Medvedev crushed Bernd Karbacher 6-3, 6-2 in
the 32-year-old German's last singles match on the professional
circuit.
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy but it's time," said Karbacher, announcing his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
Karbacher reached a career-high 22nd in the world rankings in
1995. But he was then hampered by a string of knee injuries and
fell to a modest 246th in the ATP Champions' Race.

<HEADLINE> Motorola to Invest 1.9 Billion Dollars in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- With the approval of the State
Council, China's highest governing body, Motorola is to invest
another 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in Motorola (Tianjin) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, the U.S.'s largest investor in China, will use a
large proportion of the funds to set up a chip factory in the
north China port city.
</P>
<P>
China has issued preferential policies concerning integrated
circuit producers. Those with an investment above 800 million yuan
(about 96 million U.S. dollars) will be charged only six percent
of added value tax, instead of the normal 17 percent. Also, such
enterprises are exempted from duties on imported raw materials,
and they are allowed to change their profits into U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Motorola sources said the 21st century will be an era of
soaring growth for China's telecom industry, and that the company
would like to expand its business in the country and further
strengthen its cooperation with its Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
Motorola (China) puts most of its investment in its Tianjin
company, to produce pagers, cellular phones and interphones.
Motorola (China)'s sales volume last year was 30.9 billion U.S.
dollars-worth, with profits of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Syria Frees 3 Jordanian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian authorities have released
three Jordanians who had been labelled as political prisoners by
Jordan and they will return to Amman soon after obtaining travel
documents, Jordanian sources said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three were freed last weekend from Syrian prisons, one of
them was identified as 41-year-old Khalid Awad who had been
imprisoned for 12 years in the Tadmour jail in Syria, and the other
two preferred to remain unnamed.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to return to Amman after obtaining travel
documents from the Jordanian embassy in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Imad Sharqawi, a prominent Jordanian lawyer, said he expected
more Jordanian political prisoners to be released soon from Syrian
prisons after Bashar al-Assad was sworn in as Syrian president on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bashar had promised earlier to declare a public amnesty after he
becomes president, said Sharqawi, who was heading a Jordanian
committee lawyers, which is seeking the release of some 650
Jordanian and Palestinian prisoners from Syria.
</P>
<P>
Sharqawi believed that they were arrested mostly on charges of
being members of political parties, especially the Muslim
Brotherhood and radical Palestinian factions, while some others
were accused of serving Jordan's General Intelligence Department.

<HEADLINE> CPLP Leaders End Summit with Maputo Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state from member
countries of the Community of the Portuguese-speaking Countries (
CPLP) ended their third summit on Tuesday in the Mozambican
capital Maputo, with the issue of the final statement known as the
Maputo Declaration.
</P>
<P>
According to the final statement of the two-day summit, the
development of education, training, science and technology in the
African Portuguese-speaking countries is considered crucial for
the further economic and social development of the African
countries that are still facing difficult economic and social
situations.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said that centers for research and training in
the Portuguese language will be respectively set up in Cape Verde,
Mozambique and Angola. Meanwhile Portugal and Brazil will
increase their financing for the CPLP's Special Fund, the Angolan
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement announced that Brazil will assume the
organization's rotating leadership for the following two years
with the Brazilian official Dulce Pereira elected unanimously as
the Executive Secretary of CPLP.
</P>
<P>
According to the Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso and the
new executive secretary, among priorities set by Brazil for its
CPLP mandate are a multilateral campaign against AIDS and the
creation of a program for the formation of 120 diplomats from the
group of seven-nations spanning three continents.
</P>
<P>
The summit also decided that the next CPLP summit will be held
in Brazil in the year of 2002, while Sao Tome and Principe will
host the mid-term Council of Ministers of CPLP in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Portuguese-speaking world, expressed in the
declaration their support for the full independence of East Timor
and the elections planned in the territory next year.
</P>
<P>
Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao, attending the Maputo summit as
an observer, said his country would adopt Portuguese as its "
official language" and hoped to join the CPLP soon as its eighth
member state. In the Declaration of Maputo, the summit also
praised Angola for "its efforts to combat subversion and re-
establish peace" in the context of the aborted 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol. It blamed the new eruption of war in Angola on "Jonas
Savimbi and his followers" in the rebel movement, namely the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), for
not having "fulfilled commitments" taken under the peace agreement
six years ago.

WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A new class of portable, Web-
based products will allow us to surf the Internet without having
to park ourselves at a desk over the next few years, a U.S.
scientist predicted in the latest issue of The Futurist.
</P>
<P>
"The Net has a larger place in the world than the desktop,"
said Mark Stefik, a scientist at the Xerox Palo Alto research
center. He predicted a new class of mobile, Web-based products,
including:
</P>
<P>
-- The personal document reader. This interactive, lightweight
digital display could allow people to watch the news or read
downloaded articles on the go.
</P>
<P>
-- The hiker's companion. This pocket-sized device would be
tied in to the Global Positioning System(GPS) so hikers would
always know where they are. In addition, it could retrieve
information from the Internet about the weather and trail
conditions. It could also summon help in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
-- The Web suit. This would be a radio-networked collection of
wearable devices for computing and browsing the Web. A pair of
special glasses would display information on a virtual screen in
front of a user's eyes -- but still allow people to see the real
world. The Web suit could be set up to respond to voice commands,
or it could be accessed through a keyboard worn on the forearm.
</P>
<P>
Stefik said that technological advances are bring these devices
closer to reality. The advances include improvements in displays,
increasing bandwidth, and longer-lasting batteries.

<HEADLINE> Photodynamic Therapy May Become Safer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a
treatment for cancers and other diseases, may become safer in the
future, reported the latest issue of The Futurist.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at Destiny Pharma in England have developed a
combination of new photosensitive chemicals and light sources that
ensure the potentially toxic, light-sensitive chemicals are not
left behind in the body, according a Futurist report.
</P>
<P>
PDT starts with an injection of light-sensitive chemicals into
a patient's bloodstream. The chemicals are absorbed by the body's
tissue, including the diseased tissue.
</P>
<P>
When a penetrating light is directed at the diseased tissue, it
reacts with the light-sensitive chemicals to produce a toxic
substance that kills the diseased tissue.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Registers Trade Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia witnessed increasing
momentum in both imports and exports for the first half of this
year, the state statistics bureau said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's foreign trade over the period reached 471.8 million
U.S. dollars, with 209.7 million dollars in exports and 262.1
million in imports.
</P>

year's level, with a 71.8-million dollar rise in exports, a 68.5-
million dollar rise in imports and a 3.3-million dollar decrease
in trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to higher copper prices at the international market,
Mongolia's exports of copper powder rocketed 54.7 percent in the
period under review. Exports of livestock raw materials also
enjoyed a considerable hike.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia trades with more than 50 countries, with China
remaining its biggest trading partner.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,July 18(Xinhua) -- France won 12.3 billion francs (1.8
billion U.S. dollars) of trade surplus in May, mainly because of
the sale of a record number of Airbus planes and good performance
of its civilian industry.
</P>
<P>
The French Customs said on Tuesday that the surplus in May is
eight times as high as that in April, which saw a 1.554 billion
franc (229 million U.S. dollars) surplus.
</P>
<P>
France's overall trade surplus in the first five months this
year amounted to 27.564 billion francs (4 billion U.S. dollars),
lower than the same period last year, which registered a 44.7
billion franc (6.57 billion U.S. dollars) surplus.
</P>
<P>
The lowering of the trade surplus is partly caused by the
rising of oil prices in world markets.
</P>
<P>
France sold 18 Airbus passenger planes, a steam ship and
several satellites in May.

<HEADLINE> Chad Denies Fall of Garrison to Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chad denied on Tuesday the fall of a
strategic garrison in the northern desert to the rebel force of
Movement for Democracy and Justice in Chad (MDJC), according to a
report by Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
The government forces are still controlling the garrison of
Bardai and fighting is continuing around it, the agency quoted the
Chadian government as saying in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The attackers are in the process of pulling out from the area
after meeting strong resistance from government forces, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
AFP also quoted an anonymous source of the Chadian government
as saying that the MDJC tried to catch the garrison in order to
use it as an air support base to receive logistics from a third
country.
</P>
<P>
The MDJC, which has been harassing government forces in the
northern desert region of Tibesti since October 1998, said on
Tuesday that it had taken the garrison of Bardai, killing 240
government soldiers and wounding hundreds of others.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drug Cheaters Go for Oympic Medals without Punishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The USOC has evaded its responsibility to screen and discipline
those cheaters in its quest to produce medal-winning athletes,
said Wade Exum in his 30-page complaint filed in the U.S. District
Court in Denver.
</P>
<P>
Although no athletes were named, the lawsuit said that Exum
knows of competitors who tested positive for performance-enhancing
drugs in the Olympic trials and went on to win medals at the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, Exum said his anti-drug efforts were "willfully
and repeatedly undermined" by the committee's "unwillingness to
adopt an anti-doping program that had any real probability of
preventing athletic doping and protecting the health and well-
being of American athletes."
</P>
<P>
The USOC's real interest is "procuring gold medalists who
perform not just superbly, but who realize superhuman achievements,
" the suit said, adding that the USOC "knows that to achieve these
superhuman records, doping must occur."
</P>
<P>
It further pointed out that Exum was told to mind his own
business when he raised concerns that non-doctors were given keys
to what the suit calls "a pharmacopeia" in the USOC's Sports
Medicine Division and allowed to dispense the medicines to
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Exum is "aware of documentation" that will support his
allegations, including the one about Olympic medal-winners who
have escaped punishment, the USA Today quoted Exum's attorney John
McKendree as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the case, Exum also charged that USOC leaders hampered his
anti-drug battle and denied him promotions and opportunities
because he is black, saying that he was forced to resign and will
be seeking lost pay and benefits in addition to punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
USOC chief executive officer Norm Blake criticized the timing
of the lawsuit, filed less than two months before the start of the
2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, because it raises "
unwarranted allegations" that tarnish the reputation of American
athletes.
</P>
<P>
Exum resigned June 5 after nine years as director of the USOC's
Drug Control Administration, saying he was forced out by racial
discrimination, ethical dilemmas, harassment and other factors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Urge Halt to Damage to Ancient Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Chinese scholars today
urged that the rampant damage being done to ancient cities be
stopped and that officials responsible for such activities be
investigated according to law.
</P>
<P>
The experts from the State Cultural Relics Bureau and other
departments revealed at a seminar on protecting ancient cities
that a number of important historical cities are being seriously
damaged to pave the way for urban construction and infrastructure
building.
</P>
<P>
Among the cities are Anyang in central China's Henan province,
where the capital of the Shang Dynasty was located and the
earliest Chinese characters on animal bones were discovered. The
local government has built a highway that has badly damaged
historical sites.
</P>
<P>
Another is the eastern city of Dinghai, where the first battle
of the Opium War was fought, in 1840. Most of the old buildings
have been pulled down in order to facelift the area, despite local
criticism.
</P>
<P>
The scholars listed a number of other ancient cities that have
been disfigured, including Guiyang, an important city in the
history of the Long March, and Xiangfan, where there was once a 1,
000-year-old wall.
</P>
<P>
Many cities have lost the qualification for bidding for being
listed as World Cultural Heritage because of such destruction,
according to the scholars.
</P>
<P>
To people's astonishment, many officials consider such
destruction to be achievements in promoting economic growth, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the authorities regularly investigate and
re-evaluate the historical cities, and officials responsible for
such damages be punished.

WUHAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The second Yangtze River flood crest
this summer today arrived at the meandering Jingjiang section,
which is considered the most crucial section on the river for anti-
flood precautions.
</P>
<P>
The crest passing the Shashi Hydrometeorological Station in

morning, surpassing the danger line by 0.01 m. This is the first
time this summer that the flood has risen over the mark, according
to the station's records.
</P>
<P>
The second crest was formed by the gathering of mammoth water
flows from the upper reaches of the Yangtze and its tributaries,
which have received large amounts of rainfall, with flooding in
the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
No danger spots have been reported at press time. All provinces
along the lower reaches are on high anti-flood alert.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Shanghai, China's
biggest industrial and commercial center, may make the down
payments for their new houses now with loans offered by the local
branch of the China Construction Bank (CCB).
</P>
<P>
Since they can apply for the loan with their old houses and
the new houses they will buy as the mortgage, they don't have to
afford the payment immediately, which usually accounts for over 20
percent of the cost of a new house and is a great burden for most
people.
</P>

Insiders pointed out that the measure has greatly eased the
pressure on those citizens who are not rich but hope to improve
their living conditions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ten branches and offices of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) today signed agency
contracts with 10 city commercial banks on payment settlement
businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to the contracts, the 10 city commercial banks will
entrust the ICBC to do its payment settlement businesses, marking
the beginning for the two sides to establish a standardized and
legalized cooperative relationship.
</P>

the past several years amid the country's reinforced financial
system reforms, and have contributed significantly to China's
economic construction.

<HEADLINE> Referendum Needed to Approve Agreement With Israel: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Public referendum was the sole way for
the Palestinians to accept a possible agreement with Israel,
Mustafa al-Barghuti, member of Palestinian People's Party's (PPP)
General Secretariat, said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Most Palestinian factions were not represented in the ongoing
talks at Camp David between Palestinian leaders Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak under the auspice of United
States President Bill Clinton, he said.
</P>
<P>
Any agreement to be reached at the Camp David summit would not
be accepted by the Palestinians unless it complies with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Council's decision
on Jerusalem, borders, refugees and settlements, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said referendum was the sole means to learn whether the
possible deal meets the redlines set by the council, the
centralized power body within the Palestine National Council.
</P>
<P>
The 129-member PLO Central Council approved early this month
Arafat's plan to declare an independent state on September 13 this
year with Jerusalem as its capital, even if a peace deal cannot be
reached with Israel by that time.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)
disengaged itself from the Palestinian delegation to Camp David
talks, objecting what it called U.S. pressures on Arafat to twist
his attitude and interfere in Palestinian internal affairs.PPP and
DFLP are both opposition factions in the PLO.
</P>
<P>
The talks at Camp David, near Washington, entered the eighth day
on Tuesday with no reported breakthrough on the final-status
issues, specially the fate of Jerusalem and refugees.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Israeli side was said to have asked to expand
Israeli control over Jerusalem by annexing Maalita Adumim, Gush
Atsbun and Gibat Zaif Allah Jewish settlement into the disputed
holy city.
</P>
<P>
Israel demanded full Israeli control over those locations while
it proposed handing over some quarters of the city to the
Palestinians and establishing a safe passage to the Temple Mount
and allowing a Palestinian flag on the shrine, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Reassures Public on Special Powers Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
reassured the people Tuesday that his bid to seek special powers
from Congress is intended solely to speed up the rehabilitation
and development of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The president told reporters here that the fast-track
implementation of Mindanao projects through these extra powers
will prove to the people of Mindanao his administration's
sincerity and resolve to secure a better future for them.
</P>
<P>
"We have no other intention but to speed up the development of
Mindanao, nothing else," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada asked critics of the government's proposed extra powers
measure to first scrutinize the merits of the proposed bill before
"issuing unsubstantiated comments against it."
</P>
<P>
"We have no other aim but to fast-track Mindanao's development
and put in place confidence building measures to show our Muslim
brothers that we are sincere in developing Mindanao as soon as
possible," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration will attack the root cause of the
Muslim in urgency -- which is poverty -- through the
implementation of socio-economic development projects and programs
in the long-neglected island.
</P>
<P>
The measure will include provisions providing for a moratorium
on strike and lockouts, the suspension of temporary restraining
orders involving certain and vital government infrastructure
projects, and the declaration of tax holidays and special economic
zones in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the measure will not allow negotiated contracts
for infrastructure projects and the procurement of supplies. It
will instead push for public biddings, which will ensure
transparency and graft-free contracts.

<HEADLINE> S. African Inflation Rate Remains at 5.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The official inflation rate
remained unchanged at 5.1 percent last month, Statistics South
Africa announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bureau head Mark Orkin said the main contributors to the
inflation rate were similar to those in May this year.
</P>
<P>
"These were annual increases in transport -- mainly due to a
23-percent rise in petrol prices over the year -- food, medical
care and health expenses and household operation," Orkin said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He said these factors were partially offset by the drop in
mortgage interest rates which fell from 19 to 14.5 percent in the
past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The annual percentage change in the CPIX (the consumer price
index), excluding mortgage interest rates, also remained the same
at 8.5 percent in metropolitan areas in June, Orkin said.
</P>
<P>
Food prices rose at the annual rate of 9.5 percent last month,
up from 8.8 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
"This was mainly due to annual increases in the prices of
vegetables, meat and grain products," Orkin said.

<HEADLINE> France Seeks to Solve Dispute Over Seizure of Russian Yacht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 18 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine has written a letter to his Russian counterpart Igor
Ivanov to explain the seizure of the Russian yacht "Sedov" last
week at the French port of Brest.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry assistant spokesman Francois Rivasseau
said on Tuesday that the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact
with the Russian embassy in Paris to "examine the best ways to
solve this problem."
</P>
<P>
French judicial authorities seized "Sedov" last Thursday after
the yacht arrived at the invitation of the annual Brest
international yachts rally.
</P>
<P>
The move was made at the request of the Geneva-based import-
export company Noga which accuses the Russian government of
refusing to pay it 1.4 billion U.S. dollars for the food it sold
to Russia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"Sedov," a 117-meter, four-mast white yacht with 176 people on
board, is the vedette of the Russian fleet belonging to the
Murmansk Military Technology University.
</P>
<P>
Russia has warned France of serious consequences if it does not
release the yacht.

<HEADLINE> Ex-East Germany Sports Boss Gets Sentence in Doping Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A Berlin court handed down a
suspended sentence against former East German sports boss Manfred
Ewald on charges of doping the mainly young female athletes who
brought huge swimming and track and field success to the country.
</P>
<P>
Ewald, 74, got a 22-month suspended prison sentence, and co-
defendant Manfred Hoeppner, a former top East German sports doctor,
received an 18-month suspended sentence, according to local media
reporting.
</P>
<P>
The sentences came at the end of a lengthy trial which heard
often emotional accounts from the victims of how they suffered
hair growth, muscle-mass increase and other severe hormonal
dysfunctions.
</P>
<P>
Both officials were found guilty of 20 of an original 142
counts of aiding and abetting bodily harm in connection with the
systematic doping programme, which also resulted in ailments from
liver disease to miscarriages and even death.
</P>
<P>
Both men also were ordered to pay the court costs of 20 women
who joined as co-plaintiffs, all former East German athletes who
say they still suffer the side-effects of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
Ewald said nothing after leaving the court while Hoeppner said,
"I think the court did an orderly job. I can live with the ruling.
"
</P>
<P>
Former track and field athlete Brigitte Michel said the co-
plaintiffs were disappointed with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
"We, the victims, are not satisfied at all. The abuses cannot
be corrected with any ruling," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ewald was president of East Germany's sports federation from
1961-88 and of its National Olympics Committee from 1973 until the
country ceased to exist in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Hoeppner, as the country's top sports doctor, worked out the
details of the doping program _ including the secrecy rules _ and
distributed the steroids to the sports doctors and coaches, the
court found.
</P>
<P>
The results were dramatic: Little East Germany, with less than
17 million people, went from 20 gold medals in 1972 to an
astounding 40 in 1976. East Germans won 11 of 13 events in women's
swimming in 1976 and again in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The court said it handed down a lesser sentence to Hoeppner
because he had apologized to the former athletes and cooperated
with prosecutors in other doping cases. Ewald never made a direct
apology.
</P>
<P>
About 20 former East German coaches, doctors and other have
been convicted and given fines, suspended sentences or both.

<HEADLINE> Melvin Lister Wins Long Jump in U.S. Olympic Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Collegians Melvin Lister,
Dwight Phillips and Walter Davis swept the men's long jump top
three spots at the Olympic track and field trials Monday night,
but will they be good enough to extend the Americans' domination
of the event at the Sydney Games?
</P>
<P>
The United States has won every Olympic long jump competition
since 1964 except for the 1980 Moscow Games boycott.
</P>
<P>
The streak of seven straight gold medals, including the last
four by Carl Lewis and the world record jump by Bob Beamon in 1968,
now appears in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Lister's best jump of 8.32 meters was the shortest winning
performance at the trials since Larry Myricks' 8.28 meters in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Lister was elated, pumping his fists in the air after he
landed. But his excitement has to be tempered as U.S. long jumping
has deteriorated after Lewis retired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Only two Americans were ranked in the top 10 last year --
Erick Walder at No. 4 and Roland McGhee at No. 10, and the United
States was shut out of medals at the World Championships. Walder
finished sixth and McGhee seventh Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Phillips was second at 8.14 meters, and Davis finished third
at 8.11 meters.
</P>
<P>
Sandra Glover, an elementary school teacher in Houston until
this year, ran the fastest time in the world this year in winning
the women's 400-meter hurdles in 53.33 seconds, beating world
record-holder Kim Batten and Tonja Buford-Bailey to second and
third in 54.70 and 54.80 seconds respectively.
</P>
<P>
Glover who was to make her first Olympic team, was last year's
U.S. champion and fifth at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Four-time NCAA champion Seilalu Sua won the women's discus at
65.90 meters, the second-longest ever by an American and the
longest in 14 years, only next to Carol Cady's national record of
66.10 meters.
</P>
<P>
Sua set the American junior record three times in 1997 and has
a habit of hitting big throws in championship meets.
</P>
<P>
Suzy Powell finished second at 64.58 and Kristin Kuehl was
third at 61.74.
</P>
<P>
Lynda Blutreich, the American record-holder in the javelin,
won the event at 58.28 meters, and will be the only U.S.
representative at the Olympic games if no one else reaches the "A"
standard by September 11.
</P>
<P>
Blutreich, an assistant coach at Duke, finished third at the
1996 trials, but did not go to Atlanta because she did not meet
the qualifying standard.
</P>

BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasuries picked up
broadly today but the trade kept thin with a trading value of 1.45
billion yuan, 47 million more than yesterday.
</P>
<P>
009908, a 3.30 percent bond due 2009, edged up 0.24 percent to

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Hungarian bus manufacturer Ikarus has offered a joint
venture for bus production in Turkey, reported Turkish Daily News
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ikarus Turkey-desk manager Erzebet Loczy said that although
Turkey is an important market, Ikarus cannot sell buses there due
to stiff competition from Asian companies and a major disadvantage
in prices despite good quality.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem can be overcome by producing buses in Turkey
and appealed to the Turkish authorities to support a joint
Hungarian-Turkish Ikarus project.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's first nuclear power plant project will
probably be postponed for a long time amid controversy between the
government and the bidding consortia, reported Turkish Daily News
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Energy and Natural Resources Ministry should select the
winning consortium by July 24, the latest deadline set after
several postponements.
</P>
<P>
However, the announcement is set to be put off for at least
another year due to the Treasury's reluctance to provide guarantees
for the financing of the five billion U.S. dollars plant to be
built in Akkuyu in the southern province of Mersin.
</P>
<P>
But bidders will not accept another delay. A representative of
the U.S. firm Westinghouse warned they will withdraw their bid if
the government again postpones it.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Increasing poverty and the erosion of purchasing power
in Turkey are attracting greater attention as the government's
anti-inflation program puts extraordinary pressure on wages and
farm produce prices, reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Unequal income distribution and low growth rates are also shown
as the basic reasons for the fragility of the Turkish economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate there are 20 million poor people, with five
million of them below subsistence level. In other words, there are
five million people in Turkey suffering from hunger.
</P>
<P>
Unfair income distribution and widespread poverty do not only
have economic implications, but also political ramifications.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shochat announced
on Monday plans to continue reducing purchase taxes on electrical
appliances. Shochat refused to mention any figures for his promised
reductions or to say which highly-taxed electrical appliances will
be included in his plans.
</P>
<P>
Current purchase taxes range from 30-55 percent on large home
appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and stoves and
from 65-85 percent on luxury items and home entertainment equipment
such as dishwashers, stereos and video recorders.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Postal Authority has issued a tender
for a computer company to devise a program that will enable it to
sell stamps via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate the authority will complete preparations to
sell stamps via an Internet site by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
A program is being developed that will allow customers to
download stamps from the authority's web site after paying for them
via credit card, print them out on a home printer and stick them on
an envelope to put in the mail.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Bank of Israel issued a report on Monday
calling for increasing the minimum wage by adopting standards for
the calculation of such salaries.
</P>
<P>
It noted that over 50 percent of employers surveyed pay their
workers less than the minimum wage, currently 2,798 shekels ( about
700 U.S. dollars). The sum is updated on April 1 each year, based
on 47.5 percent of the average salary.
</P>
<P>
One of the recommendations raised is to automatically link
salaries to the consumer price index, which would maintain their
real value. Another option is to link the minimum wage to the
median salary.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish company, Ezinc Metal Sanayi A.S., which is
based in central Kayseri province, is exporting solar collectors to
European and African countries, reported the Anatolia News Agency
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ezinc Metal Sanayi A.S. Deputy General Director, Hakan Alas,
told reporters Tuesday they have exported 1.3 million U.S. dollars
copper and aluminium solar collectors to Spain, Italy, France,
Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Saudi
Arabia, Yemen and Jordan in last six months.
</P>

Alas said they plan to increase their solar collectors exports
to three million U.S. dollars by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Continue Seeking Release of All Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government reassured
the public Tuesday that it would continue to seek the release of
all hostages still being held by the Abu Sayyaf in their lairs in
the southern provinces of Sulu and Basilan.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said the government remains
hopeful the release of German hostage Renate Wallert would be the
beginning of a series of breakthroughs to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this is the start of breakthroughs in the case. We
hope this will cover not just the Malaysian captives but the
Europeans as well," Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Zamora also stressed the government didn't pay any ransom for
Wallert's release. "We always believe in a no-ransom policy. Any
ransom you give would allow them to buy arms and recruit new men,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf released Wallert Monday but still kept her son
and husband in captivity. Wallert was flown to Manila and has been
brought back to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Wallert as the first European hostage to be released since the
Abu Sayyaf took 21 persons hostage from a resort in Sipadan Island
of Malaysia on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Her release also came days after the foreign ministers of
France, Finland and Germany met with Philippine President Joseph
Estrada over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
On July 14, the Abu Sayyaf released a Malaysian hostage,
bringing to two the Malaysian they had freed.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the hostages abducted from Sipadan Island, the Abu
Sayyaf is also reportedly holding 16 Filipinos, three French
journalists, one German journalist in different places.
</P>
<P>
Chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado expressed
confidence on Monday that the government can secure the safe
release of all the other hostages soon.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado also reiterated the government's willingness to
discuss community projects with the Abu Sayyaf once the crisis is
over.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier said it would implement community
development projects for Mindanao, acknowledging the need to
address the root of crime and rebellion.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Khmer Rouge Commander Released from Charge of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 18 (Xinhua)-- A Cambodian court on Tuesday
released a former Khmer Rouge commander who had faced six charges
of attempted murder, kidnapping, robbery, armed group, terrorism
and destruction of state property.
</P>
<P>
Chhouk Rin, 48, military commander in former Khmer Rouge
controlled district in Kampot province, located about 140
kilometers southwest of Phnom Penh, faced the above charges
including a charge of murdering three western backpackers in a
train ambush in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The attacks caused to the deaths of 10 Cambodian passengers on
train and injured three others at the spot while three foreigners
were killed two months later in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The three backpackers known as Australian David Wilson,
Frenchman Jean Michel Braquet and Briton Mark Slater were killed
along with ten other Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
Judge Thong Sam Ol announced no guilty to Chhouk Rin,
explaining that he defected to the society following an appeal by
the government as stated by the law on outlawing the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
After it has brought to force, this law allows an amnesty
period of six months for members of the political or military
organization of the 'Democratic Kampuchea' group to reintegrate,

of Cambodia, without being charged for offenses they committed, he

</P>
<P>
Chhouk Rin, defected to the government on Sept.15, 1994,
bringing along some hundreds of ex-Khmer Rouge forces. And he was
promoted as colonel after joining the government since then.
</P>
<P>
Last year, one of his colleagues, Noun Paet, 52, was sentenced
to life imprisonment on the same case because he did not defect to
the government until his arrest.
</P>
<P>
Three former Khmer Rouge commanders have faced the above six
charges, they are Chhouk Rin, Noun Paet and Sam Bith.
</P>
<P>
The cases of Chhouk Rin and Noun Paet have been cleared while
Sam Bit remained free from the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh's court officials, however, said Sam Bith will be
brought to the trial as well whenever an investigation his case is
completed. He is ranked as a brigadier general, advisor to the
defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
Australian government has urged Cambodian government to take
legal action against Sam Bith.
</P>
<P>
The court has issued an arrest warrant to Sam Bith since early
this year, but the government has failed to carry out its
obligation.
</P>
<P>
Chhouk Rin was arrested in early Jan, this year and put under
detention since then.

<HEADLINE> WFP Launches Major Relief Operation for Drought-hit Afghans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) Tuesday announced a major relief operation to help
up to 1.6 million famine-threatened people survive the worst
drought in Afghanistan in over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Under this new emergency operation, WFP will bring about 120,
000 metric tons of food into Afghanistan at a cost of 55.4 million
U.S. dollars over the coming 12 months.
</P>
<P>
WFP estimates that between 8 to 12 million Afghans will be
affected by the drought and between 3 to 4 million severely
affected.
</P>
<P>
The extremely low level of precipitation in the first half of
2000 has destroyed almost all the rain-fed crops in the country
and decimated the livestock. The next chance for a normal crop
will not be until May 2001, it said.
</P>
<P>
The cereal deficit for Afghanistan in 2000/2001 is expected to
be as high as 2.3 million tons, more than double that of the
previous year, said Mike Sackett, WFP Afghanistan Country Director.
</P>
<P>
The director further observed that the effects of the drought
are seriously aggravated by the ongoing civil war and an economy
which in many areas is in a state of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, a country in war for the last 21 years, needs
about 4.1 million tons of cereals a year to meet domestic
consumption.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Madame Tussaud's to Open in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Have you ever imagined sharing
the picturesque view of Victoria Harbor with nearly one hundred
most famous celebrities in the world, including famous British
writer Shakespeare, and pop super stars like Michael Jackson and
Madonna?
</P>
<P>
This fantasy will come true when the reputed Madame Tussaud's
studio in London opens its third permanent overseas wax portraits
exhibition, which is also the first in Asia, at the Victoria Peak,
Hong Kong, in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Preparation for Madame Tussaud's Hong Kong is on the full wing
and 94 world celebrities will make their Hong Kong debut as
scheduled, Richard Hollyer, Head of Molding of the Madame Tussaud'
s studio in London, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The heads, arms, bodies and clothes of the wax figures have
arrived in Hong Kong in over 100 crates for assembling and
decoration.
</P>
<P>
At a rented workshop at the Hong Kong's Academy for Performing
Arts, Hollyer and a small team of experts who have specially flown
in from London are working on the wax figures, fitting together
various body parts, dressing them, and most important of all,
doing detailed hair styling and skin coloring, which is key to
make the figures lifelike.
</P>
<P>
Except a few portraits still awaiting a final touch, the
majority of the wax figures have been assembled and transported to
the Peak, including the portraits Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing,
Movie star Jackie Chan, and windsurfing champion Lee Lai Shan.
</P>
<P>
"We sometimes say our attraction is the next best thing to
meeting these celebrities in real life, but in some ways it is
better than the real things," said Peter Carson, general manager
of the Madame Tussaud's Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Where in real life would you have 100 celebrities all gathered
under one roof?" he said.
</P>
<P>
For guests to Madame Tussaud's, they can interact with
incredibly realistic likeness of celebrities, movies stars,
sporting heroes and world leaders, get up close and personal and
even be photographed with them.
</P>
<P>
The original Madame Tussaud's in London, which was founded by
Madame Marie Tussaud, has a 200-year history of modeling
celebrities. Since its founding in 1884, Madame Tussaud's has been
London's most popular attraction and drawn over 2.5 million
visitors yearly.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong is the most popular tourist attraction in the
Asian region, Madame Tussaud's has chosen it as its third
permanent overseas location, the others being in Amsterdam, since
1970, and Las Vegas which opened last July, said Hollyer.
</P>
<P>
Madame Tussaud's Hong Kong will feature a variety of themed
areas including Movie World, Sports and Behind the Scenes, a
creation of the sculptor's studio showing the mysterious procedure
how lifelike wax portraits are made. The new Madame Tussaud's in
Hong Kong is expected to draw up to 500,000 visitors a year.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Technical Guideline on Urban Garbage Disposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China today issued a 10-page
technical guideline on urban garbage disposal, in a bid to tackle
the pollution caused by the country's growing mountains of
domestic garbage.
</P>
<P>
Yang Luyu, director of the Department of Urban Construction
under the Ministry of Construction, said the policy was also
designed to improve garbage disposal technology and reduce the
waste of resources through the adoption of proper disposal
technology.
</P>
<P>
The policy calls for measures to reduce the amount of garbage
discharged in urban areas, including discouraging the practice of
excessive packaging, and promoting clean vegetables and clean fuel
for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy, local governments are encouraged to
choose the right garbage disposal technology and equipment that
best suits local conditions.
</P>
<P>
It also encourages diversified investment in garbage disposal
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 114 million tons of domestic garbage collected last
year in the country's 668 cities was dumped in land-fill areas,
which occupy a lot of land and pollute the environment, the
director said.
</P>
<P>
Urban garbage, which has been growing at seven percent on
average each year during the past decade and more, will pose a
great threat to the country's environment unless the disposal
methods are improved, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Technical Guideline on Urban Waste Water Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China today issued a 10-page
technical guideline on urban waste water treatment, in a bid to
clean up the country's polluted rivers.
</P>
<P>
Yang Luyu, director of the Department of Urban Construction
under the Ministry of Construction, said at a news briefing that
about 70 percent of the waste water in urban China is discharged
directly into water areas without treatment, resulting in the
pollution of more than one third of the country's rivers.
</P>
<P>
As part of the framework plan for national urban waste water
treatment, the policy serves as an important guideline for local
governments in planning and building water treatment plants, the
director said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, only 31 percent of the waste water in
urban China was treated by about 398 waste water treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
According to the guideline, at least half of the waste water
should be treated in towns and cities across China by 2010, while
for some major cities at least 70 percent of the waste water
should be treated.
</P>
<P>
Some experts believe that more than 30 billion yuan is needed
each year during the coming 10 years to reach the waste water
treatment targets.
</P>
<P>
The guideline is based on advanced techniques used at home and
abroad, the director said.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Blasts Taiwan's Pro-Independence Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China's official Xinhua news
agency published a commentary today condemning the pro-
independence stance of a Taiwan-based political party.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says a Taiwan-based party organized by a handful
of "Taiwan independence" elements in Taiwan province recently
announced that they are going to found the "interim government of
the Republic of Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The party also plans to issue a "declaration of independence"
and apply to join the United Nations as "Taiwan State," the
commentary says.
</P>
<P>
These actions all show that separatists in Taiwan are stepping
up their secessionist activities, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan-based party, which was set up in 1996, is an
extremist "Taiwan independence" body, and is attempting to make "
political room" for "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
However the party has won little support from Taiwan people,
and their candidate for "president" was ineligible to run due to a
lack of petitioners. After the elections, 23 of its leading
members quit the party, it says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary berates these "Taiwan independence" extremists
for their stubborn pro-independence positions, as the cross-
straits ties are at a critical point and Taiwan compatriots are
increasing their call for the improvement of the ties.
</P>
<P>
These extreme activities will only disgust Taiwan people,
rather than get their attention.
</P>
<P>
The commentary criticizes the activities demanding "Taiwan
independence," saying that the Chinese government and the Chinese
people will not sit idly by when there are "Taiwan independence"
forces at work.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan independence" is a blind road, the commentary says. It
urges the small number of "Taiwan independence" elements to
abandon their pro-independence stance and cease their activities
to split the motherland.

encourage a merit certification system."
</P>
<P>
Sun urged that more attention be paid to the work, saying that
the departments concerned should take this opportunity to
encourage local police chiefs to study hard and to combine the

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Get More Aid From EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has formally
notified the Lebanese government of its intention to raise its
pledged aid package from 120 million euros (108 million U.S.
dollars) to more than 200 million euros (180 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The aid package was approved at the Washington 1996 Friends of
Lebanon conference for the 1996-2000 period, An Nahar newspaper
Tuesday quoted diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for the implementation of development
projects for the entire country but preferably for the south, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The sources denied reports that some EU members have recently
expressed reservation about giving additional aid to Lebanon, and
stressed that the money will be delivered after the EU completes a
study of the projects which Lebanon plans to implement.
</P>
<P>
The EU has not yet made any decision about the donor conference
for helping reconstruct south Lebanon due to be held in Beirut on
July 27. Its member countries will be present at the meeting at an
ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
The EU will make its final decision on the size of the aid at
its September conference of donor states that will be held at
ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Since signing the Economic and Financial Cooperation Agreement
with the European Community in 1977, Lebanon has benefited from
more than 900 million euros (810 million dollars)in grants, loans
and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
The money went to projects in reconstruction, economic and
social development, human rights, environmental protection and
refugee assistance.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Speaker Expects Peace Agreement at Camp David </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel could reach a peace
agreement with the Palestinians at the Camp David summit, but the
outcome might not be clear until the last minute, said Israel
Knesset (parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Ehud Barak's mood is very cautious but
determined as the Camp David summit enters its decisive state,"
Burg told local media.
</P>
<P>
"I would say it is the highest motivation I have ever seen in
any Israeli leader to make such a risky breakthrough in order to
bring peace for the people of Israel and the Palestinians," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the prospects for reaching an agreement at the
summit, Burg said he still hoped a deal was possible.
</P>
<P>
"In Israel usually the best solutions come at the last minute...
with the Palestinian side they are coming sometimes even after the
last moment," he added.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which began at Camp David near Washington last
Tuesday and was attended by Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, is aimed at working out a
framework agreement on key issues such as Jerusalem, borders,
refugees, settlements, ahead of the September 13 target date for a
final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said that the pace of the peace talks at
Camp David had been accelerated on Tuesday due to Clinton's
anticipated departure for Japan to attend the G-8 summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his advisors are pressing both the Israeli and
Palestinian sides to reach the framework agreement before his
departure on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If an agreement or declaration is not reached, the two sides
could decide to suspend the talk or to continue at Camp David and
wait for Clinton's return.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament to Debate Early Election Bills Again: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset, or Parliament,
will bring two bills which call for dissolving the Knesset and hold
early elections, to the vote in two weeks, Speaker Avraham Burg
announced Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The move will revive the opposition parties' early election
threats against Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who is now attending a
three-way summit with U.S. and Palestinian leaders at Camp David,
Maryland in order to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who was elected to his post last July, should end his
four-year term in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The two bills were submitted by the major opposition faction
Likud and another right-wing party Yisrael Beiteinu -- National
Union.
</P>
<P>
Burg announced that he had approved the vote of the two bills,
which will take place before the Knesset's summer recess due to
begin on August 4.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a similar early-election motion, also proposed by
Yisrael Beiteinu -- National Union and Likud, was defeated by the
government in its first reading in the Knesset with the help of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised more financial budget for Shas's educational
network, in return for the pivotal party's voting against the
early-election bill.
</P>
<P>
It was said then that according to Israeli law, since the bill
was dismissed, the oppositions should wait at least six months
before they could table a similar one asking for early elections,
unless Speaker Burg concluded that a substantive change has
occurred in the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
However, the Shas party, along with two right-wing partners in
Barak's coalition, Yisrael Ba'aliya and National Religious Party
had resigned from the government ahead of the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Legal advisers of the Knesset thus ruled, Burg said Tuesday,
that the bills could be voted upon once again due to the drastic
change of the political scene.
</P>
<P>
Burg said that he had informed the government about his
decision.

<HEADLINE> Barak Ordered to Explain Businessman's Presence at Camp David </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli High Court of Justice
on Tuesday instructed Prime Minister Ehud Barak to explain within
five days why Yossi Ginnosar, a businessman, is on behalf of the
government at the three-way Camp David summit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the interim injunction issued by the court, Barak has
to show that there is no conflict of interests between Ginossar's
activities in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and his
participation in the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Ginossar has been Barak's personal liaison with PNA Chairman
Yasser Arafat. He is now doing public relations work for Barak in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The court's instruction followed a petition by Knesset
(Parliament) Member Zvi Hendel from the National Union Party who
demanded that Ginossar not be allowed as a member of the peace
talks delegation.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, Hendel petitioned the High Court to order
Barak to stop using Ginossar as a liaison with Arafat, because he
allegedly maintained highly lucrative business relations with the
PNA.
</P>
<P>
In response to Hendel's charges, the Prime Minister's office
issued a statement saying that "the prime minster invited Ginossar
to the talks because of the contribution he has made to several
prime ministers in the past in developing relations with the
Palestinians and his good connections. All three parties to the
talks are pleased that he is there."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak instructed David Ivry, Israel's ambassador to
Washington, to continue assisting three Israeli public relations
experts who are using the Israeli Embassy as their base to explain
the government's stance in peace talks. They are businessmen Tal
Silberstein, Moshe Gaon, and Yoni Koren.
</P>
<P>
Barak's instruction was given only a few hours after Ivry
decided to suspend the activities of the lecturers. Ivry's decision
was made in light of two petitions submitted to the Israeli High
Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The petitions were submitted by the opposition Likud bloc and by
the right-wing group "Betzedek." They requested that the High Court
of Justice immediately instruct the prime minister, his legal
advisor and the Civil Service Commissioner to prevent private
citizens from filling official positions.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit between Barak, Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton began on July 11 in a bid to hammer out a
framework deal for the settlement of the final status issues
between the Israelis and Palestinians, including the status of
Jerusalem, border, water resources, the future of Jewish
settlements and the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
As the talks entered the crucial stage, the opposition parties
in Israel also stepped up their efforts to undermine Barak's
political authority in the talks.

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes U.S., Israeli Allegations on Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Tuesday refuted the remarks made by U.S. and Israeli
officials on Iran's successful test-firing of a Shahab-3 missile,
saying such propaganda campaigns are doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel are using Iran's missile test as an
excuse to justify their own arms race and provide their needed
budget, Kharrazi was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the U.S. has launched a propaganda campaign
against Iran to divert world public opinion from the development of
its national missile defense (NMD) system.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Defense Ministry announced on Saturday that it has
successfully test-fired an upgraded Shahab-3 medium-range missile
with an aim to upgrade the defense power of the country in line
with its policy of deterrence.
</P>
<P>
The missile, with a range of some 1,300 kilometers, was said to
be able to hit Israel and U.S. forces stationed in the Gulf, thus
causing concern and strong reaction from both countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen warned Monday of the risk
of an accelerated pace of missile development by Iran in the wake
of its successful Shahab-3 missile test.
</P>
<P>
"I think any time you have success in a particular missile
system, it gives you confidence to move forward with more tests
with greater capability," Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister, however, defended Iran's missile
test, saying the test is aimed at reinforcing the defense
capabilities of Iran and posing no threats to any country.
</P>
<P>
"How is it that the Zionist (Israeli) regime can equip itself
with various kinds of weapons including weapons of mass destruction
but regional states should not have weapons to defend themselves?"
Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
Iran uses its defense capabilities to insure the stability and
security of the region, he added.

<P>
"During the 25 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties,

understanding between our two peoples, as well as ever-expanding
exchanges between departments and at different levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields between
the two peoples are also developing smoothly, he added.
</P>
<P>
The senior Chinese leader said he was "pleased to see that
China-Thailand relations have become an exemplary model of
peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation between
countries with different social systems."

<P>
Noting that "Thailand is one of the most important cooperation
partners of China in Southeast Asia, " he remarked, " at the turn
of the century, China-Thailand cooperation enjoys a new
opportunity for development."
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that, with concerted efforts of both sides, the

<HEADLINE> Golden Triangle Drug Growing Threat to China: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Evidence points to the fact that
the drug problem in the notorious Golden Triangle is a growing
threat to China, a senior police officer said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the opening of the Fifth ICPO-Interpol Heroin
Conference, Chen Cunyi, a deputy director of the Ministry of
Public Security's anti-narcotics bureau, said that the center of
the notorious Golden Triangle is moving northward to the northern
part of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
China's anti-narcotics forces are under increasingly greater
pressure, he said, noting that besides traditional drugs like
opium, the Golden Triangle is also producing new strains like
methamphetamines, known as "ice," according to the Chinese police
officer.
</P>
<P>
The output of drugs in the area is increasing steadily, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China seized 5.3 tons of heroin, mostly smuggled
from the Golden Triangle. Meanwhile, Chinese police investigated
187 drug cases, including 148 "ice" cases handled by police in
Yunnan Province, which borders Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Last year, local police also confiscated nearly 272 tons of raw
chemicals for use in drug-making, while nearly 250 tons were
seized by Yunnan police, accounting for 91 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
China has become a major sales market for drugs from the Golden
Triangle, though the country has launched a series of anti-drug
campaigns, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Golden Triangle drugs, "ice" in particular,
are also posing more of a threat than ever before in the world,
according to the police officer.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Meets Taiwan Kuomintang Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Qian Qichen met here
today with a delegation from Taiwan's Kuomintang party, led by Her
Zyh-huei.
</P>
<P>
Qian confirmed the consensus reached by the Kuomintang
delegation during its talks with the Mainland-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
During its stay in Beijing, the Taiwan delegation and the
mainland association agreed to adhere to the consensus achieved in
the 1992 talks between the mainland body and the Taiwan-based
Straits Exchanges Foundation and to promote direct mail, shipping
and aviation services.
</P>
<P>
Qian told the Taiwan visitors that the Taiwan authorities'
avoiding of the One-China Principle is the fundamental factor in
the two sides finding it difficult to resume cross-Straits talks
and to improve cross-Straits ties.
</P>
<P>
To find a solution acceptable to the two sides to resolve their
disputes under the One-China Principle will be helpful for the
cross-Straits exchanges and for the final realization of peaceful
reunification under the One-China Principle, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
"Under the One-China Principle, all Taiwan-based parties,
groups and individuals are welcome to have wide-ranging contacts
and talks with us to accumulate consensus and join forces for
improving and developing cross-Straits relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, director of Taiwan Affairs Office under the
Communist Party of China's Central Committee and the Taiwan
Affairs Office of the State Council, attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation arrived in Beijing on July 16 at the
invitation of the mainland association.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Help Drought-hit Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has agreed to
help Iran cope with a severe drought that has hit the country and
inflicted heavy damages, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Jazayeri, secretary of Iran's national committee for
lessening effects of natural disasters, signed an agreement here
Monday with visiting representative of the U.N. Development Program
Francisco Bastali to the effect, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iranian and U.N. experts will cooperate in
forging medium- and long-term projects aimed at countering droughts
and reducing the financial damages.
</P>
<P>
They will also endeavor to formulate appropriate guidelines for
the optimal use of water and related resources.
</P>
<P>
Jazayeri said that drought has so far engulfed 17 Iranian
provinces completely and 11 others partially, resulting in over 13,
181 billion rials (about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars) in damages to
agricultural, cattle and potable water sectors.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government has allocated some 0.3 percent of
the state budget, equal to 2,600 billion rials (some 317 million
dollars), to combat the drought.
</P>
<P>
Violent protests broke out recently in the southwestern Iranian
city of Abadan over the lack of potable water. Protesters smashed
shop windows and set tires ablaze to vent their anger with the
local government for failing to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been undergoing a particularly dry summer this year
that has worsened the drought problem the country has been facing
since last year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Withdraws International Staff From Southern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has withdrawn
its international observers from southern Iraq, U.N. spokesman in
Iraq George Sommerwill told Xinhua on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sommerwill said that the U.N. began the operation on Sunday by
pulling out its staff from Basra, Misan, Thi-Qar and Qadissiyah in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Iraqi staffers in the U.N. team are
continuing their work in the above-mentioned provinces.
</P>
<P>
"For the coming week, there will be no international U.N.
observers in southern Iraq," said Sommerwill.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. took the move by listening to "some advice," but the
international observers are expected to be back in the south to
resume their work soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also rule out the possibility that the U.N. activities in
Iraq might be affected by the event.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Iraq and the U.N. has shown signs of
deterioration recently.
</P>
<P>
An editorial, issued by an English-language newspaper Monday on
the 32nd anniversary of the revolution on July 17, 1968, condemned
the U.N. for doing nothing to Iraq and the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"All Iraqis and fair-minded people of the world feel that the U.
N., in one way or another, is the main reason behind prolonging
sanctions imposed on Iraq," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan vehemently attacked the
U.N. Security Council on Sunday, claiming that it has turned into a
council "for war against the Third World states, especially those
rejecting the U.S. subordination and submission."
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-Iraqi relations were also affected by the killing of
two staffers of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in
late June.
</P>
<P>
A lone gunman, identified as 38-year-old Fuad Haidar, burst into
the FAO building on June 28, killing two FAO staffers. After a two-
hour confrontation with the Iraqi security forces, the gunman
turned himself in.
</P>
<P>
Haidar said that he did this in protest against the decade-old
U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that the sanctions have so far claimed the lives
of over 1.3 million people, most of them children and the elderly.

<HEADLINE> New Sri Lankan Envoy Leaves for London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Sri Lankan diplomat left
for London Tuesday morning to assume duties as the South Asian
island's new high commissioner (ambassador) to Britain, family
members said.
</P>
<P>
Mangala Moonesinghe, former Sri Lankan High Commissioner in New
Delhi, is expected to present his credentials to the British queen
this week or next week.
</P>
<P>
A respected former parliamentarian, Moonesinghe is the longest
serving High Commissioner under the government of President
Chandrika Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
He was a member of the team which had discussions with the
Norwegian peace brokers earlier this year to seek peace with the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels who are fighting
for a separate state in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Moonesinghe's appointment to London comes at a time when Sri
Lanka is making a great effort in pressurizing the British
government to close down the LTTE office in London.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Moonesinghe, who is a good
negotiator, may be able to play an important role during his
tenure in London.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Court to Give Verdict on Anwar's Sodomy Trial Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The High Court here announced
Tuesday it will give on August 4 its verdict on the sodomy trial
of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the date is tentative, Judge Arifin Jaka said "If I
am not ready, I will notify both parties. I will write my judgment
so that you all can look at it."
</P>
<P>
Arifin made the announcement after Anwar and Gobind Singh Deo,
counsel for Anwar's adopted brother Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja
finished their submissions at the end of the joint sodomy trial
Tuesday, the 117th day of the trial, one of the longest in the
Malaysian history.
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would base his decision solely on the
evidence before the court and for this he needs some time.
</P>
<P>
"As a Muslim, first I'm answerable to the next world. My
conscience is clear," Arifin told Anwar who personally replied to
points raised by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, and Sukma, 39, are separately charged with
sodomizing Azizan Abu Bakar, 39, former driver of Anwar's family.
</P>
<P>
Sukma, a businessman, also faces another charge of abetting
Anwar to sodomize Azizan.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution closed its case against Anwar and Sukma on the
46th day of the trial on August 20 last year after calling nine
witnesses, including former inspector-general of police Haniff
Omar while the defence called 31 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, also the former finance minister, is now serving a six-
year jail sentence for corrupt practices.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Traditional Exports Down 8.7 Percent Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's traditional
exports decreased by 8.7 percent in 1999 compared with the
previous year due to a decline in production volume and world
market price.
</P>
<P>
A Bank of Tanzania Economic Bulletin released here on Monday
said traditional exports declined from 167.5 million U.S. dollars
in the fourth quarter of 1998 to 152.9 million dollars in the last
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The document attributed the fall to a decline in export volumes
as well as export unit prices of the export commodities.
</P>
<P>
Export volumes for coffee, cotton, tobacco and cashew nuts went
down by 16.4 percent, 2.5 percent, 7.4 percent and 36.1 percent
respectively when compared with the volumes recorded during the
same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Only sisal and tea recorded an increase in export volumes by 45.
3 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Except for cashew nuts, whose export unit price increased by 66.
9 percent, all other traditional exports recorded a decline in
export unit prices when compared with prices attained during the
corresponding period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The fall in export unit prices for most of the traditional
commodities is partly explained by an increase in global
production that left prices depressed, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the fall in demand of commodities in their raw
form and the decline in quality of some traditional commodities
also accounted for unfavorable price movements in the world market.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank report said, unlike traditional
exports, non-traditional exports recorded an increase of 13.2
percent to 94.3 million dollars from 83.3 million dollars recorded
in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly attributed to petroleum products and
mineral exports, which registered sharp increases of 1,072.3
percent and 336.8 percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Famine Relief Food Arrives in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A consignment of 20,000 tons of
maize donated by the U.S. government to help alleviate hunger in
Kenya has arrived in the Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa in the
southeastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Daily Nation newspaper quoted the World Food Program
(WFP) as saying on Monday that the donation will be distributed to
hungry families in the North Eastern, Rift Valley, Eastern and
Coast provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Already more than 14,000 tons of the relief food has been
discharged and is on the way to the targeted destinations," said
Joern Lose, WFP official at Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The official said the maize consignment, which is worth over 5
million U.S. dollars, was donated by the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 3 million Kenyans are in
desperate need of food assistance this year compared to 961,000 in
1992 when the country experienced severe drought last time.
</P>
<P>
According to the Office of the President, the Kenyan government
has purchased 868,680 bags of maize (90 kilograms per bag) during
the last season, of which 811,600 bags have been distributed to
drought- and famine-hit areas since July last year.
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, the government announced to waiver the duty of
imported maize to encourage local millers to import more maize as
the government's famine relief stocks had dwindled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government set aside 500 million shillings (
about 6.5 million dollars) for the purchase of some 303,000 bags
of maize for distribution to food deficient districts.

<HEADLINE> E-tailers in U.S. Hit by Internet Fraud: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Fraud on the Internet is
taking its toll on electronic retailers (e-tailers) in the United
States, who are also getting hit by credit card companies,
according to a survey released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey of some 160 U.S. companies, conducted by research
and consulting firm Gartner, reveals that 12 times more fraud
exists on Internet transactions than offline ones, and that e-
tailers are paying credit card discount that are 66 percent higher
than traditional retailer fee.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Gartner said, Web merchants bear the liability and
costs in cases of fraud, while credit companies generally absorb
the fraud for traditional retailers as long as the retailer
follows procedures and saves a physical signature on a credit card
transaction receipt.
</P>
<P>
Surveyed e-tailers reported that their average credit card
discount rate was 2.5 percent plus about 30 cents a transaction.
The same average for traditional retailers is about 1.5 percent
plus 30 cents a transaction. This means a merchant may pay credit
card processors 2.8 U.S. dollars for selling a shirt online, but
pay only 1.8 dollars for the same transaction in the physical
store.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, e-tailers must pay for Internet payment gateways
and fraud detection, which can add another 50 cents to each
transaction. Meanwhile, credit card companies have failed to offer
e-tailers cost-effective solution for fraud prevention.
</P>
<P>
According to Gartner, there is no incentive for a credit card
company to break this unfair fee structure for e-tailers. But the
credit card issuer that is bold enough to lower the fees online
could create a real competitive advantage on the Web and possibly
gain early market share among e-tailers and Internet shoppers.

<HEADLINE> Clash Between Kosovo Serbs, U.N. Forces Injures 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethnic Serbs in Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province clashed Monday night with U.N. peacekeepers,
leaving nine Serbs injured, the Tanjug news agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conflict erupted in Kosovska Mitrovica when an unnamed
local Serb youth, who had been badly tortured by Albanian
terrorists, was arrested by the U.N. police at 9.00 p.m. (1900 GMT)
Monday, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 Serbs gathered at the local police complex to demand
the release of the youth. Several Serb youths seized an American
policeman as hostage in exchange of the arrested Serb youth. The
American shot and wounded a Serb man.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, U.N. peacekeepers rushed to the scene to disperse
the protesters, using tear gas and stun grenades. Nine Serbs were
injured and sent to hospital, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yugoslav official statistics, Albanian extremists
launched more than 5,000 terrorist attacks, leaving over 1,000
civilians dead and some 360,000 non-Albanian residents displaced
one year after the NATO-led U.N. peacekeeping forces entered
Kosovo in June 1999.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Grant Swiss Citizens Border Privileges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Swiss President Adolf Ogi has
obtained guarantees from the British government that holders of
Swiss passports will soon be granted the same time-saving
privileges enjoyed by European Union (EU) nationals when entering
Britain.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair gave the assurance to Ogi on
Monday during their talks in London, said Swiss Radio
International.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that Britain would move as soon as possible to scrap
the need for Swiss citizens to join non-EU nationals for passport
control in often lengthy queues.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 600,000 Swiss citizens travel to Britain every
year, where about 500 Swiss companies are based.
</P>
<P>
Their discussions in London also focused on the progress being
made in the ratification of the bilateral treaties between the EU
and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Following their talks, Ogi said the British prime minister
would do all he could to ensure speedy ratification -- not just in
Britain but also in other EU states this year so that the
bilateral accords could come into effect on schedule in January.

<HEADLINE> WTO Technical Assistance Fund Gets Donation From Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government has pledged 2.
6 million Dutch guilders (about 1.2 million U.S. dollars) for the
period 2000-2001 to the Global Trust Fund for World Trade
Organization (WTO) Technical Assistance to benefit developing
countries and economies in transition.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Netherlands' Ministry for Economic Affairs,
Director-General for Foreign Economic Relations Dirk Bruinsma on
Monday signed a memorandum of understanding with WTO Director-
General Mike Moore, according to a WTO press release.
</P>
<P>
"Funding technical assistance to help developing countries
implement their WTO obligations is in all WTO members' interest
and no charity," said Bruinsma.
</P>
<P>
"Technical assistance is certainly not the only solution to
implementation problems but the least we can do is provide a
minimum and stable source of funding."
</P>
<P>
Moore said: "Once again, I am extremely grateful to the
Netherlands for its donation to the Trust Fund. Only through these
types of generous contributions can the WTO respond now to an
increasing demand for technical assistance."
</P>
<P>
He said his organization's regular budget for technical
assistance of about 450,000 U.S. dollars is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Moore has called on WTO members to raise the regular budget for
technical assistance. A group of countries, including the
Netherlands, have proposed a phased increase in the regular budget
of 10 million Swiss francs (about 6.6 million U.S. dollars)
earmarked for technical assistance.

<P>
HANGZHOU, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Snakes, scorpions and toads are
raised at Wang Lizhong's breeding center, where requests for his
considerable stock of all that slithers and hops are arriving from
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Every day, the 32-year-old farmer in east China's Zhejiang
Province, has a packed schedule of meeting clients, taking calls,
and returning e-mails. Only months ago, Wang was a man without a
market, but now, he says, orders for his critters are "pouring in
like snowflakes."
</P>
<P>
Last March, a Japanese company bought three tons of sun-dried
snakes for medicinal purposes from Wang's website.
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea the Internet was so magical," said the excited
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
In less than two years, Wang has signed 1.3 million yuan (about
157,000 U.S. dollars) worth of deals, earning 600,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Only few years ago, he lived in a village in the city of
Haining, and knew nothing about computers or the Internet. But he
learned from a friend who opened a computer shop in a nearby town.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, Wang opened his website, hetianlong.com, for
just 2,000 yuan (about 240 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
From that point on, he said, "customers have been like pies
falling from the sky." His products are sold to Guangdong, Fujian,
Henan and other provinces in China, as well as Japan, the Republic
of Korea and other counties.
</P>
<P>
China has 13 million Internet users, 200,000 of which are in
Zhejiang Province.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Famous Chinese actress Zhao Lirong
died of lung cancer at her home Monday. She was 73.
</P>
<P>
Born at Baodi County of Tianjin Municipality, Zhao early on
studied a form of local opera especially popular in northern China.
</P>
<P>
In her 60 years of professional life, she was considered an
outstanding talent in both stage opera and films.
</P>
<P>
She received the best actress award at the Tokyo International
Film Festival in 1991 for her performance in "Spend the New Year."
She also won the 1992 Baihua Best Actress, an important national
award given annually in China.
</P>
<P>
In her 60s, Zhao experimented with comic routines, short
performances featuring two or three players. She gained a
reputation for them in China and they became the highlight of her
artistic life.

Other villagers in Zhejiang are cashing in on the e-commerce
craze. From his site alibaba.com, Lin Haibo earns more than 20,000
yuan a month selling fashionable shoes to the Republic of Korea
and as far away as the United States.
</P>
<P>
More and more Chinese peasants are learning computer skills to
handle business instead of trekking long distances to meet clients
in person.
</P>
<P>
Another farmer who sells shoes via the Internet is Wang Yong'an,
in Yuexi county in the Dabie Mountain, Anhui Province in east
China.
</P>
<P>
For centuries, the rugged mountain roads made it difficult for
peasants to climb out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Wang opened a website to sell handtailored cloth shoes.
To cater to international clients, he often went to study English
at a school more than 10 kilometers away and learned computer
science on his own by reading texts on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Wang has helped more than 1,000 families escape poverty by
selling shoes made by them to customers in the United States,
Japan, Britain and Finland.
</P>
<P>
This year, he opened a new website yangsheng.com in Chinese and
English languages, and his ambitious goal is to help more than 4,
000 families in the mountainous areas earn more money.
</P>
<P>
"Internet shortened the distance between this mountainous area
and the global market," he said.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Completes Acquisition of HK Union Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) announced here today that it has finished all
legal procedures for acquiring the Hong Kong Union Bank and now is
officially the Union Bank's holding company.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a Chinese commercial bank has acquired a
bank listed in the international financial center.
</P>
<P>
ICBC sources said the acquisition has been approved by the
People's Bank of China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission,
the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the Hong Kong
Monetary Administration and the Hong Kong Securities Regulatory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
On April 19, the ICBC and Hong Kong Merchants (Holding) Co.
signed a trade deal in Hong Kong on acquiring 240 million shares,
or 53.24 percent of Union Bank's total equity, by the ICBC at 7.52
HK dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
Market response to the deal has been positive, with the price
of Union Bank shares rising to 8.7 HK dollars by July 14 when the
deal was completed.
</P>
<P>
The Union Bank maintains its status as a listed company after
the acquisition due to the fact that minority shareholders still
hold up to 30 percent of the bank's equity.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu: China-Russia Trade Has Great Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
today that the Chinese government pays great attention to the
development of trade and economic cooperation with Russia and the
two sides should do more to explore the great potential.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who
is on a state visit to China, his first since he won the
presidential election in March.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that although the two countries have witnessed growth
in trade and economic cooperation over the past several years,
enterprises of both China and Russia should increase contacts and
study each other's market to help expand trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They can use economic means to push forward bilateral ties, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also said he is looking forward to meeting
with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov for the fifth regular
meeting between prime ministers of the two countries later this
year in Beijing. He added that China is busy preparing for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Putin said trade and economic cooperation between Russia and
China have bright prospects as the two countries are complementary
in their resources, technology, products and professionals.
</P>
<P>
He said the governments of the two countries should help
enterprises expand cooperation in various areas.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kasyanov will bring home more firm cooperative
projects after his meeting with Zhu, Putin added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Chinese President Jiang Zemin exchanged views
with Putin on a wide range of issues. They also signed the Beijing
Declaration and a joint statement on the anti-ballistic missile
issue.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Tons of Grape May be Dumped in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- About 50,000 to 60,000 tons of
grapes
might end up in dumps in Cyprus this year because of overproduction
and stiff competition in the European market, local media reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The grim prospect was disclosed by Cyprus' Commerce and Industry

Minister Nicos Rolandis.
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult to sell the large quantities of grape to
the wine industry because of its inability to export bottled wine
to the
European market, Rolandis said Monday, after a meeting with
representatives of farmers' unions.
</P>
<P>
The unions stressed the importance of the government support for
the grape production and wine industry.
</P>
<P>
Union leader Michalis Litras said that the solution of dumping
grapes is painful, but it comes out of necessity, adding that the
state is the natural employer of farmers and therefore must bear
the weight of overproduction on its shoulders.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 11,625 tons of grapes had to be dumped for the first
time since 1989, just over 10 percent of a 107,000-ton harvest.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy might be repeated this year, and market conditions
are worse than last year, said reports. Prices on the European
market, for white grapes in particular, are too low this year for
Cyprus' producers to compete.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of Cyprus grapes are exported in raw form or
processed, usually as wine.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government used to buying up producers' unsold grapes
and dispose of them in a bid to keep market prices stable, but it
placed a huge burden on already depleted state coffers.

urged Turkey to grant cultural rights to people of the Kurdish
origin as well as the rights to receive education in the Kurdish

short term.
</P>

<P>
A military report reaching here said the ambush occurred at 6:
30 this morning in Matanog, Maguindanao, a few meters from the
headquarters of the 3rd Marine Battalion near the town hall.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, elements of the Army's 27th Infantry
Battalion were on their way to clear the area of rebels when they
were waylaid by about 100 MILF guerrillas who were waiting for the
convoy to pass.
</P>
<P>
The fighting came a day after a massacre in Lanao del Sur
province where suspected MILF secessionists shot dead 20 civilians
inside a mosque.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada ordered Tuesday the military and the
police to go after the perpetrators of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said members of the MILF have split into
small group after their caps in Mindanao were overrun one after
another by government forces since April this year.
</P>
<P>
MILF Chairman Hashim Salamat called for a jihad against the
government after the falling of Camp Abubakar, the headquarters of
the MILF in Mindanao on July 9.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF has been fighting for an independent
Muslim State in Mindanao for more than two decades, a request

<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Water
Resources Kipng'eno arap Ng'eny has been charged with abuse of
office for a loss of about 186 million shillings ( about 2.5
million U.S. dollars) in his position as head of Kenya's former
sole telecommunications corporation.
</P>
<P>
It was one of the biggest cases in the past 20 yeas regarding
the volume of loss caused by abuse of office, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After a claim about his mismanagement was made by Parliament's
Public Accounts Committee, the Kenya Anti-corruption Authority
last week obtained the approval to apprehend him.
</P>
<P>
Ng'eny denied the charge before a Nairobi court on Monday and
was released on 10 million shillings (about 130,000 dollars)
personal bond.
</P>
<P>
The case is expected to be heard again on July 31.
</P>
<P>
The offense was allegedly committed in October 1992 when Ng'eny
was managing director of the defunct Kenya Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation.

Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to resume "as early as possible"
their postponed second round of talks on normalizing ties, Kono
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The two nations still need to make some arrangements to set
the date for the normalization talks ... but I want to set it
through the ministerial meeting," Kono said.
</P>
<P>
Kono said the two countries also agreed to resume swiftly a
meeting between their respective Red Cross societies on
humanitarian issues and the postponed third round of homecoming
visits by Japanese wives of DPRK people.
</P>
<P>
Japanese government officials said the two countries reached
the agreements through informal contacts when Kunihiko Makita,

TOKYO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo
Tuesday on worries that the liquidation of bad loans in Japan may
not go smoothly, with the benchmark Nikkei index closing below 17,
000 points for the first time in three weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
The two presidents agree that to ensure their relationship as
good friends, good neighbors and good partners, the two countries
would sign a cooperative treaty of non-alliance, and the two
foreign ministries are authorized to conduct negotiations on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
They also highly value the successful resolution of the
majority of the border issues between the two countries, and
agreed to speed up negotiation to expedite the settlement of the

<P>
On economic and trade relations, Jiang pointed out the two
countries would increase overall cooperation in all fields,
including the economic and trade sectors, in a bid to lay a firm
foundation for their strategic partnership, and he outlined
several reasons and suggestions for doing so.
</P>
<P>
First, China and Russia, close geographically, are highly
complementary in their economy, science, technology, resources,
personnel, and other areas, and great potential remains to be
tapped. Both sides should carry out more explorations in this
regard in line with the rule of the market economy based on mutual
trust and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Second, the arrangement of regular meetings between prime
ministers of the two countries has done a lot to stimulate
bilateral cooperation in all specific fields, and both sides
should make full preparations for the fifth regular meeting this
fall so that they can reach as many agreements as possible.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that China will work with Russia to bring bilateral
relations to a new stage where the two countries will always be "
good friends, good neighbors and good partners."
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during talks with Russian President
Vladimir Putin, who is on a state visit to China, the first since
he won the Russian presidential election in March.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said it is a correct and historical choice for China and
Russia to establish and develop a strategic partnership of
cooperation. The partnership serves the strategic interests of the
two countries and the needs of safeguarding world peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The partnership will also help push forward the process of
multi-polarization of the world, Jiang stressed, adding that to
strengthen the good-neigborly friendship and the strategic
cooperation with Russia is China's set policy in its relations
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The strategic partnership between China and Russia has been
fruitful with the joint efforts of both sides over the past few
years, Jiang noted, adding that their meeting today served as "an
important link between past and future" in Sino-Russian relations.

efforts to strengthen cooperation with China in various areas,
Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
After becoming president, Putin has reiterated that Russia will

Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
"We greatly appreciate that," Jiang said.

existing friendship and make plans for the long-term development
of bilateral relations.
</P>

Russia is determined to build an all-dimensional, multi-tier
and high-level relationship with China. The Russian side thinks
this will serve not only the interests of people in both countries

<HEADLINE> No Change in Death Sentence of Murderers of German Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The death sentences handed down to
the four men convicted of murdering German citizen Juren Hermann
Pfrang and his family are not subject to change, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a regular press conference in response
to a question on a report that the German government and relatives
of the German victims petitioned for a lesser punishment for the
four defendants.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said as the case took place in China, it must be judged in
accordance with Chinese law, which is exactly what Chinese
judicial authorities have been following so far.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the tragic case allows for no milder punishment, as
the murders were brutal and have had serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
The murderers must be sentenced to death, he said, otherwise
the sentences will not be in the interests of protecting Chinese
and foreign citizens in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the public prosecutors of the Nanjing City People'
s Procuratorate at a public hearing held two months ago, at
midnight on April 1, the defendants broke into the Nanjing
residence of the Pfrang family and fatally stabbed all its four
members.
</P>
<P>
Juren Hermann Pfrang was deputy general manager of Yaxing Benz
Ltd., a Sino-German joint-venture bus manufacturer based in
Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, east China.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court in Nanjing, the provincial
capital of Jiangsu, on July 14, gave the death penalty to the four
defendants.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police will continue to
strengthen cooperation with their colleagues in other parts of the
world to strike back against international drug crime.
</P>
<P>
China's Public Security Minister Jia Chunwang made the above
remarks when addressing to today's opening ceremony of the Fifth
ICPO-Interpol Heroin Conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that as the planting, production and using of drugs
are on the rise across the globe, law-enforcement departments in
all countries are facing the challenge of rampant drug-related
crimes.
</P>
<P>
To root out this problem, governments of all countries,
especially related law-enforcement departments, should strengthen
their cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's major drug problem is heroin
trafficking from the Golden Triangle area bordering southwestern
China. The unbridled narcotics dealing and use in the area has
turned the country into a drug transporting channel as well as a
victim of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the number of registered drug users in China amounted
to 680,000, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
For many years, Chinese police have fought to block the flow of
drugs from the Golden Triangle to the Chinese mainland, and have
scored remarkable achievements, Jia added.
</P>
<P>
Jia promised that the Chinese Government will continue to work
together with countries bordering this area. In the meantime, it
will reinforce collaboration with ICPO-Interpol and other
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The conference attracted more than 200 representatives from
over 60 countries and international organizations, including ICPO-
Interpol secretary-general Raymond Kendall.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Government Angered by Campaign Against British Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government blamed some
parliamentarians for making public the delicate dispute over ending
British army exercises off its sovereign bases in Cyprus, local
media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Marios Matsakis, deputy of Democratic Party, faxed
a letter to Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, demanding the end
of British army exercises outside the bases.
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by nine deputies, three of them from ruling
Democratic Rally party, five from the main opposition AKEL party
and one from Democratic Party, was subsequently leaked to the
press.
</P>
<P>
The deputies, all from Limassol district, southern coast of the
island, where one of the two British sovereign bases situates,
urged the foreign minister to take measures to terminate as soon as
possible the exercises undertaken by British soldiers outside the
boundaries of their bases.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government, however, has denounced the letter as
mishandling a delicate matter.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, it should not be dealt with by publishing letters.
Any ideas or opinions should be discussed in private by the
government and the foreign ministry before making them public,"
said government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides, Democratic Rally leader Nicos Anastassiades and the
Attorney-general Alecos Markides were thought to have been angered
by the leak, said the report.
</P>
<P>
But Matsakis hit back. slamming the government's reluctance to
confront the British bases.
</P>
<P>
British has retained two sovereign military bases under the 1960
Treaty of Establishment of the Cyprus Republic, one in Limassol
area, and one in southeastern area of the island.
</P>
<P>
The British bases are allowed, under the 1960 treaty, to use
land outside the bases for military exercises for a certain period
each year.
</P>
<P>
Local people believe that the British troops violated the human
rights of Greek Cypriots by holding the military exercises outside
the bases.

The Jerusalem Post:

-- Egypt is concerned that an Israel at peace with its Arab
neighbors may compete with it for regional hegemony, and as a
result is unlikely to warm its chilly relations with Israel, even
if a peace agreement is signed with the Palestinians, a political
source in Jerusalem said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source was explaining the meaning of a cable recently sent
by Israeli Ambassador to Egypt Zvi Mazel, saying that Egypt is not
interested in a normalization of ties, but a continuation of the
present "cold peace," even if Israel inked an agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohanmmed Bassiouny said that
Egypt is not interested in cooling the ties with Israel and the
peace process remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has warned that without an
agreement that would guarantee Palestinian control over Al-Aqsa
Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in East Jerusalem,
there would be no deal on any subject at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The tone of the Palestinian leader's message is indicative of
the general atmosphere at Camp David: The talks are intensive and
there is a rush to meet a deadline that is marked by the departure
of U.S. President Bill Clinton for the G-8 meeting on the Japanese
island of Okinawa on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation believes that the Americans are about to
present a document of bridging proposals in order to push the two
sides toward an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Germany Monday signed a historic deal to pay out DM 10
billion (about 4.8 billion U.S. dollars) to compensate nearly 1
million surviving Nazi-era slave and forced laborers, essentially
closing its reparations programs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after 18 months of negotiations among
the German government and industry, the U.S., Poland, Russia,
Ukraine, Belarus, the Czech Republic, the Claims Conference, and
Israel, as well as lawyers for Nazi victims who had sued German
industry in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
Slave laborers, who were primarily Jewish Nazi victims, are
expected to receive payments of up to DM 15,000 (about 7,190
dollars). Forced laborers, who are Central and Eastern Europeans,
will receive about DM 5,000 (about 2,397 dollars). Payments could
begin by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Bashar al-Assad, the son of the late Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad, was officially sworn in as the new president of Syria
Monday. The 34-year-old Bashar will begin his seven-year term as
president Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the office-taking ceremony in the parliament in
Damascus, Bashar made his maiden speech, in which he laid his plans
for Syrian policy for the coming year. Most of his address was
devoted to internal Syrian affairs, but toward the end, he
mentioned peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Bashar underscored that Syria would not compromise on the matter
of sovereign Syrian territory and demanded that Israel completely
withdraw from the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iraq Woos Arab, European States to Walk out of Isolation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has been intensifying efforts
to strengthen relations, especially trade ties, with Arab and
European countries to break the decade-old United Nations sanctions
and walk out of isolation.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government's efforts are manifested in the exchange of
visits and signing of lucrative contracts between Iraq and these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Gives Priority to Improving Ties With Other Arab States
President Saddam Hussein has said Iraq should give preferential
treatments to Arab countries in developing trade ties with them.
</P>
<P>
By taking advantage of the latest visit by Algerian Minister of
Commerce Mourad Medelci, Iraq shows its keenness to improve and
strengthen ties with other Gulf and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The visit was highly valued by the Iraqi leadership. Senior
Iraqi officials, including Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan,
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, Minister of Finance Hikmet Mizban
Ibrahim, Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah, Health Minister Umid
Medhat Mubarak and Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf, all
held talks with the Algerian minister during his July 10-13 visit.
</P>
<P>
Algeria is just one of the Arab countries with which Iraq hopes
to establish friendly relations to break its isolation in the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Close economic and trade ties have resulted in the resumption of
diplomatic ties between Iraq and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries, within the framework
of the U.N. oil-for-food program, has increased to 400 million U.S.
dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian program allows Iraq to sell oil, under U.
N. supervision, to buy basic goods such as food, medicine and other
supplies to help offset the crippling impacts of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has announced some 80 companies are expected to attend
the Baghdad International Fair in November, while there were only
30 last year.
</P>
<P>
Oman is just another example. The week-long Omani Products Fair,
which concluded on May 16, enabled the Omani companies on
exhibition to gain contracts worth 40 million dollars, seven
million dollars more than the total sum of contracts Oman signed
with Iraq under the past seven phases of the U.N. oil-for-food
deal.
</P>
<P>
Besides Oman and the UAE, Bahrain and Qatar have also renewed
diplomatic ties with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Trade ties between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, a close American ally,
are improving. In March, more than 50 trucks carrying medicine and
medical reagents from Saudi Arabia arrived in Baghdad as part of a
contract for Iraq to import 300 trucks of medicine and medical
reagents from Saudi Arabia, with each truck's load amounting to 18
tons.
</P>
<P>
Now the yearly trade volume between the two countries has
exceeded 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's traditional rival Syria has confirmed it will exchange
interest sections with Iraq, while Iraq-influenced Lebanon has
already restored diplomatic relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has reaped a lot by developing trade ties with Iraq.
Nearly 100 Egyptian companies participated in the exhibition held
in Baghdad last April, and secured contracts worth 100 million
dollars from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has won contracts worth one billion dollars under the past
seven phases of the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
What is more, there have been signs of thaw or improvement in
trade relations between Iraq and Jordan, Turkey, Malaysia,
Pakistan, Indonesia and other Arab and Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Cements Ties With Europe
</P>
<P>
Iraq has attached great importance to maintaining and developing
relations with Russia, its traditional ally.
</P>
<P>
As Iraq's biggest trade partner, Russia has got contracts worth
over six billion dollars during the past seven phases of the U.N.
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
In return, Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised to his
Iraqi counterpart Saddam Hussein that Russia is determined to push
for the removal of the U.N. sanctions, which were imposed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Such a message was conveyed to Saddam by Putin's special envoy
Nikolai Khorotzeiv, who visited Iraq in May.
</P>
<P>
Russia has also expressed its willingness to restore military
cooperation with Iraq after the U.N. sanctions on Iraq are lifted.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Russia, Iraq has strengthened relations with
France, Italy, Germany and other European Union (EU) countries
which are more sympathetic with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France, another important trade partner of Iraq before the 1991
Gulf War, has been urging its firms to make larger investments in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France upgraded its representation in Iraq last year by sending
a diplomat to run its interest section in Baghdad for the first
time since 1990, besides the already-opened trade center in
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of his Italian counterpart, Iraqi National
Assembly (Parliament) Speaker Saadoun Hamadi headed for Rome on
June 7 for a landmark visit to Italy. This is the first time for a
senior Iraqi official to visit an EU country.
</P>
<P>
The Italian parliament passed a resolution on June 21, demanding
the government to support the lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and
reopen the Italian embassy in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which is trying not to be left behind, sent a 78-member
industrial and business delegation to Iraq in late May to seek a
share of Iraq's market.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, Oil
Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid, Trade Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah
and other senior Iraqi officials, the German delegation signed a
number of contracts to provide medicine, medical appliances, oil
spare parts and agricultural equipment for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the official Iraqi News Agency (INA), the
Iraqi trade minister said trade ties between Iraq and Germany "will
witness important and big steps" during the forthcoming period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Romania, Austria, Poland, Bulgaria, Greece and other
European countries have sent officials or business delegations to
Iraq, trying to gain a slice of its profitable market.
</P>
<P>
Iraq Still Has a Long Way to Go
</P>
<P>
Iraq in reconstruction, a market of 200 billion dollars, has
been attracting officials and business delegations from all over
the world to Iraq for business talks.
</P>
<P>
Motivated by economic interests, these profit-seeking countries
are vying for Iraq's market by gaining contracts under the U.N.
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these countries are very cautious in dealing with Iraq
by sending only low-ranking officials to the country, for fear of
offending the U.S. and its Western allies which have been
vehemently opposed to any lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq
unless it is cleared of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It is also noteworthy that although the number of countries
calling for lifting the U.N. sanctions on Iraq is increasing, there
is more oral support than concrete actions.
</P>
<P>
All these factors have somewhat dampened Iraq's hope that the
strengthening of trade ties will lead to the improvement of
political ties between Iraq and Arab, European countries, and
ultimately result in the breaking of the U.N. sanctions as well as
its international isolation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Venture Capital Investment Hits Record High in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A total of 735 million U.S.
dollars were invested in 129 Israeli hi-tech companies during the
second quarter of the year, setting a new record high in a single
quarter, the Ha'aretz daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The investment eclipsed by 19 percent the previous record of 617
million dollars set in the first quarter, the paper quoted a report
issued on Monday by Kesselman and Kesselman, a local affiliate of
Price Waterhouse Coopers, in Tel Aviv, as saying.
</P>
<P>
It also brought to 1.35 billion dollars the amount of venture
capital raised by local start-ups in the first half of the year,
which is 34 percent more than all of 1999's venture capital
investment.
</P>
<P>
Of the 735 million dollars, 226 million dollars were invested by
62 venture capital funds (57 based here and five in the United
States), and the rest by other venture capital companies, including
institutional and individual investors.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Fellus, head of the hi-tech division of Kesselman and
Kesselman, said that "The steep plunges experienced by dot.com and
technology stocks on Nasdaq last quarter have neither curbed nor
slowed the growth rate of venture capital investment in Israel."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, venture capital companies invested
397 million dollars in Internet-related companies this quarter or
54 percent of the total investment, as opposed to 71 percent in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that there has been a recorded drop in
investment in Internet-related companies since 1998, although these
companies still managed to attract the lion's share of venture
capital investment," Fellus was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 129 transactions, also a record high, showed an increasing
trend of venture capital investments in earlier stages. The number
of seed-stage and first-round investments accounted for 50 percent
of all investments in the quarter, up by 55 percent and 42 percent
respectively over the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The report concludes that an increasing number of funds are
finding it necessary to adjust to the reality of earlier stage
investment, as more and newer venture capital firms are beginning
to specialize in this investment field.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Experts Find Link Between Worms Treatment and AIDS Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 18 (Xinhua) -- There is a connection between
treatment for intestinal worms and level reducing of HIV virus in
the blood of AIDS patients, Israeli medical experts said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The worms do harm to human beings' immune system, thus help the
AIDS virus to do evil, according to Professor Zvi Bentwich, chief
researcher of Kaplan Hospital in Rehovot.
</P>
<P>
When the worms are killed, Bentwich said, the immune system will
be reactivated to fight against the fatal AIDS virus and reduce the
virus level in the blood.
</P>
<P>
The expert said the discovery is very important and his team is
the first in the world to establish such a connection.
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised to find that we are the first but it is the
fact," he said.
</P>
<P>
The findings, which were made in cooperation with Ethiopian
scientists in a five-year research, have been presented to the
recently-concluded world conference on AIDS in South Africa and
aroused great interest from participants, said Bentwich.
</P>
<P>
The discovery has wide implications because the level reducing
of HIV virus can not only slow the AIDS development and extend the
patients' lifecycle, but also reduce their infective ability
through sexual or mother-baby channels.
</P>
<P>
Bentwich said his team will expand its clinical trials in other
African and Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Sudan in Secret Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Government officials from Uganda
and Sudan are reportedly in the United States for talks aimed at
settling differences obstructing the normalization of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which were described as "secret" by a Sudanese
newspaper al-Sahafa, were scheduled to start on Monday under the
auspices of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, the New Vision
daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Army Spokesman Phinehas Katirima, however, dismissed the
reports in a telephone interview with Xinhua, saying "we are not
of the meeting."
</P>
<P>
He said while Uganda had fulfilled its obligation under the
Nairobi peace agreement to release Sudanese prisoners of war,
Sudan had not done so.
</P>
<P>
Sudan was supposed to facilitate the release of children
abducted by Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Sudanese State Minister for Foreign
Relations Ali Abdel Rahman al-Nimeiri headed a government
delegation and left for the talks on Sunday. Meanwhile, Ugandan
State Minister for Regional Cooperation was also reportedly out of
the country, but it was not confirmed whether he was in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and his Ugandan
counterpart Yoweri Museveni signed an agreement in Nairobi last
December to promote normalization of ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The accord aimed to stop either country from supporting rebel
activities in the other and to secure the return of each other's
missing nationals.
</P>
<P>
The LRA has received sanctuary inside Sudan since 1988, while
Uganda has supported the Sudan People's Liberation Army, a rebel
group fighting the government.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Look Into Taxation Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is to embark on a major taxation policy
study among the 21 member states to identify areas of internal
tariffs harmonization, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, whose terms of reference have already been drawn up,
will start as soon as donor funding is sourced, said the regional
grouping's Director of Trade, Customs and Monetary Affairs
Charles Chanthunya in an interview here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the study would look into differences in tax policies
and practices of particular member states and help the secretariat
to identify areas which require harmonization.
</P>
<P>
Proposals would be made after the study and then a common stand
would be taken, he said, noting that the study is especially
important in the face of the COMESA Free Trade Area to be put in
place by October this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Chanthunya, the external tariffs harmonization
among member states, which started in 1994, is progressing very
well.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that there would be required adjustments made
well before the year 2004 when the exercise is expected to be
finalized.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that by the year 2004, all member states would have
made the necessary adjustments and be able to charge the same
tariffs on goods entering each other's country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Uganda at High Risk of Polio Contraction: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has been listed among
African countries with a high risk of polio contraction after wild
polio cases are confirmed persisting in neighboring countries, the
New Vision daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's chances of being declared a polio-free state within
the next three years have diminished, said Dr. David Newberry of
Core International based in Atlanta, the United States.
</P>
<P>
This follows a recent report of a wild polio case in Pokot in
Kenya two weeks ago. Similar cases have been reported in Burundi
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), countries in the
same surveillance area as Uganda.
</P>
<P>
No country in the surveillance area can be declared polio-free
unless no polio case has been reported for six years, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Newberry, Uganda is prone to wild polio attacks
mainly because of the insurgency in neighboring countries like the
DRC, Rwanda, Sudan and Somalia where people are forced to flee.

TOKYO -- Tokyo and Washington have reached a basic agreement on
Japan's annual reduction of its host-nation support for the U.S.
military facilities in Japan by 2.5-3.0 billion yen (23-28 million
U.S. dollars) under a new five-year agreement starting next April,
local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was a compromise of the U.S. in an attempt to
avert public criticism over the financial burden of maintaining U.
S. facilities in Japan and to ease growing anti-U.S. sentiment in
Okinawa Prefecture, where U.S. servicemen have recently been
involved in a number of incidents, the report quoted government

<P>
Fourth, the growing volume of exports and foreign investment
contracts have laid a sound basis for growth in the next six
months. Over the first half year, export orders of industrial
goods surged by 27.2 percent, while contract value of direct
foreign investment jumped by 24.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the value of actual foreign investment was 17.16
billion U.S. dollars in the first half of the year, 7.5 percent
less than in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, the Chinese government's decisions to accelerate
development of the western parts of the country and help loss-
making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) out of difficulties by the
end of the year will spur economic growth. The improvement of the
global economy and China's expected entry to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will also boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the bounceback of the economy is still not stable
because of inadequate demand. The country has yet to resolve such
problems as slow growth of farmers' income, troubled SOEs and the
imbalance of the economic structure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government will continue to carry out
a pro-active fiscal policy in the second half of the year. It will
also step up reform of the economic structure and system,
accelerate restructuring SOEs and improve environments for
investment, financing and service of private companies.

<P>
Secondly, the factors that have had lagging effect on the
economy over time have taken a positive turn. Over the first half
year, growth of output of steel, cement, nonferrous metals, crude
oil and electricity exceeded economic growth. Price indices of
industrial products and raw materials rose by two percent and 4.3
percent respectively over one year ago. Ye said that the price
hikes of raw materials is most likely to push up prices of
consumption goods in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Over the first half year, stockpiles at industrial enterprises
grew by a diminished rate of 1.4 percent, far less than the growth
of 9.9 percent of industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that since stockpiles have been cut over the first half
of the year, the growing demand will push up economic growth in a
bigger way in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, Chinese people became less interested in
saving their money owing to interest rate cuts, newly imposed tax
on interest and the requirement that they must use real names for
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Of the 364.5 billion yuan worth of newly increased savings
deposits over the period, 255.8 billion yuan was in current
deposit accounts rather than long-term deposits. The growth of
current deposits was 244.8 billion yuan more than that in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Over the first half of the year, indices of investment
sentiment, consumer confidence and entrepreneur confidence all
surged to new highs. China's stock market witnessed the biggest
boom among all stock markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
Third, non-government investment has begun to pick up. From
January to June, investment by collective enterprises grew by
seven percent over the same period of last year, while investment
by private enterprises grew by 8.6 percent.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is expected to
maintain its growth momentum in the second half of the year, an
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ye Zhen, spokesman of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS),
told a press conference held by the Information Office of the
State Council that the economy will definitely see a higher growth
rate this year than the 7.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
NBS figures show that China's economy grew by 8.3 percent year-
on-year in the second quarter, comparing with 8.1 percent in the
first quarter. The growth rate was 8.2 percent over the first half
year, 0.6 percentage points higher than in the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that the economy has reversed a slowing trend and shown
steady signs of a comeback. He cited a number of favorable factors
for continuous improvement of the economy in the next six months.
</P>
<P>
First, the Chinese government is determined to continue to
carry out a pro-active fiscal policy for the rest of the year.
Over the past two years, the government has issued more than 310
billion yuan-worth of additional treasury bonds to fund
infrastructure construction. The government investment has
effectively stimulated demand and laid a sound foundation for
future economic growth.

<HEADLINE> China, Russia Presidents Sign Joint Statement on ABM Issue (2) EDS-Recast with correction in sentence one </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any damage to ABM will trigger a new arms race and lead to an
about-face in the positive trend that appeared in world politics
after the end of the Cold War, the statement points out.
</P>
<P>
This is clearly not in the fundamental interests of any nation
in the world, it says, and the country that proposed an amendment
to ABM, a basic document in the area of disarmament, must "take
all responsibility" for undermining international stability and
security.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of the international situation shows that the demand
of a certain nation to amend ABM on the pretext of missile threat
is totally unjustified. The proposal to revise ABM is actually a
ruse to cover its attempt to violate ABM, it says.
</P>
<P>
The alteration of the content of ABM will harm the treaty and
lead to a chain of negative consequences, it says, noting that it
is of great immediate significance in the present strategic
situation to maintain the completeness and effectiveness of the
ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
The statement says that the correct way to adapt oneself to the
new challenges in international security, safeguard world peace
and protect the legitimate security interests of different
countries is not to undermine ABM, but to push forward the
establishment of a just and rational international new political
order, abandon power politics and the random use of force in
international affairs, and strengthen regional and global security.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam earned 143 million U.S.
dollars from exports of fine art and handicraft articles in the
first six months of this year, an 88.2 percent year-on-year
increase, Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fine art and handicraft articles of the country have been
exported to 50 countries and regions, including Singapore and
Japan with about 60 million U.S. dollars worth of house utensils
and ceramics being shipped to Japan annually. As a result,
handicrafts have become one of Vietnam's 10 biggest hard currency
earners.

Vietnam's export value of handicrafts reached 170 million U.S.
dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has great potential for development of handicraft
production. The Vietnamese government has recently listed
handicrafts among industries enjoying priority. Prime Minister
Phan Van Khai has asked localities and relevant agencies to map
out plans to exploit available materials in accordance with local
socio-economic development plans and to set up a number of
commercial centers at home and abroad with the aim of supporting
sales of fine art and handicraft articles.

<HEADLINE> Fiji's New President Names Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within hours of his swearing-in, the new president announced a
government which excluded rebel supporters in key cabinet
positions and named an ethnic Indian to a junior ministerial post,
the website said.
</P>
<P>
Iloilo said several Indian community leaders had been
approached to join the government but had declined.
</P>
<P>
Qarase, an indigenous Fijian, had been named interim prime
minister by Fiji's military, but the rebels accused him of being
too accommodating towards Fiji's ethnic Indian minority.
</P>
<P>
"As head of state and a symbol of national unity in Fiji, I
cannot appoint a cabinet that is expressly committed to excluding
a particular community," Iloilo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But rebel spokesman Joe Nata rejected Qarase's appointment,
saying: "We are not accepting it."
</P>
<P>
The rebels had made the dismissal of Qarase's interim
government a condition for the release last week of hostages

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Funds to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The board of the World Bank has
approved the release of substantial funds to Kenya as part of the
planned renewed assistance, the East African Standard newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The funds would help Kenya implement the ongoing public sector
reforms and the poverty reduction strategy as set out in the
interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, said Ramphele Maphele, a
director of the bank and managing director of Human Development,
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, Maphele did not disclose how much the board had
approved for disbursement, only saying that the money is available
and will be released as soon as the necessary formalities
finalized.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and Head of
Public Service Richard Leakey on Monday, Maphele said the approval
was hastened by the numerous problems now facing Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo, Kenya cleared
the last hurdle in May towards gaining up to 360 million U.S.
dollars from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (
IMF) as new loans.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts from the World Bank and the IMF were
satisfied with the government's economic recovery programs and
policy measures, he said, adding that the handing out of the money
is likely to begin after July.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls to Help Ease Zambia's Refugees Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has appealed to
the donor community to help ease the pressure on the Zambian
government following the fresh influx of refugees, the Times of
Zambia newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. resident representative Olubanke King-Akerele was quoted as
saying here on Monday during the opening of the 12th Consultative
Group (CG) meeting that the Zambian authorities are under pressure
to look after refugees fleeing from the war-torn countries.
</P>
<P>
She cited the recent arrival of 25,000 Angolan refugees in the
western part of Zambia, saying the situation is compounded by
instability and volatile military position along the Zambian-
Angola border where 9,000 Zambians have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
The donor community should provide assistance to help ease the
pressure on the Zambian government, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to King-Akerele, funding constraints faced by the
World Food Program and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees have made it impossible to provide refugees with basic
needs and rehabilitate infrastructure leading to camps.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, she said, the United Nations, the Organization
of Africa Unity and the international community have endorsed
peace efforts in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"There is, however, more political and financial support needed
to keep the momentum of U.N. peace missions," she said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day CG meeting, which was attended by representatives
from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European
Union and a number of donor countries, aims to review and assess
short and long-term economic agenda in the donee countries and
solicit development assistance to Zambia.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, France Resume Talks on Return of Ancient Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean and French experts
Tuesday began their third round of talks here on the return of the
Oekyujanggak documents of the medieval Choson Dynasty to South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The South Koran Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry said the two-
day meeting is expected to resolve the issue before the opening of
the third Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) here in October.
</P>
<P>
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin agreed to resolve the ancient document issue as soon
as possible during Kim's state visit to France last March.
</P>
<P>
The documents were taken away from the dynastic archives in
Kanghwa Island of South Korea by then French navy during a
military conflict in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
At their second round of meeting last April, the two sides
failed to reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
At that meeting, South Korea insisted that the documents be
returned while France said the documents are now French property
and that the matter must be solved in a legal manner.
</P>
<P>
The French once proposed the leasing of the documents to South
Korea on a short- or long-term basis, but South Korea rejected the
proposal.

<TEXT>
<P>
The statement says that political, legal and diplomatic means
must be used to strengthen international efforts in the matter,
prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their
carriers, explore possibilities for the setup of a global
monitoring system for preventing proliferation of missiles and
related technologies, and for carrying out extensive and non-
discriminative dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A non-strategic missile defense program and international
cooperation in such areas, which is not prohibited by ABM, should
not undermine security interests of other countries, not lead to
the establishment of any closed military or political bloc, or
threaten global and regional stability and security, it says.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are deeply concerned that a certain country in
the Asia-Pacific region might deploy any such non-strategic
missile defense system, and steadfastly oppose this, it says. (

<TEXT>
<P>
The damage wrought by ABM will trigger a new arms race and lead
to an about-face in the positive trend that appeared in world
politics after the end of the Cold War, the statement points out.
</P>
<P>
This is clearly not in the fundamental interests of any nation
in the world, it says, and the country that proposed an amendment
to ABM, a basic document in the area of disarmament, must "take
all responsibility" for undermining international stability and
security.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of the international situation shows that the demand
of a certain nation to amend ABM on the pretext of missile threat
is totally unjustified. The proposal to revise ABM is actually a
ruse to cover its attempt to violate ABM, it says.
</P>
<P>
The alteration of the content of ABM will harm the treaty and
lead to a chain of negative consequences, it says, noting that it
is of great immediate significance in the present strategic
situation to maintain the completeness and effectiveness of the
ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
The statement says that the correct way to adapt oneself to the
new challenges in international security, safeguard world peace
and protect the legitimate security interests of different
countries is not to undermine ABM, but to push forward the
establishment of a just and rational international new political
order, abandon power politics and the random use of force in
international affairs, and strengthen regional and global security.

<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin today signed a joint
statement on the anti-ballistic missile issue.
</P>
<P>
The statement says the development of the international
situation fully proves the correctness of three documents: the
joint statement on the Sino-Russian Relations at the Turn of the
Century signed on November 23, 1998; The joint Press Communique on
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) signed on April 14, 1999; and
the conclusion and the comments on ABM made in the Sino-Russian
Joint Statement on December 10, 1999, during the Sino-Russian
summit.
</P>
<P>
It says that the 1972 ABM Treaty remains the cornerstone of
global strategic stability and international security.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty "forms the basis of key international agreements on
reduction and limitation of offensive strategic weaponry and
prevention of proliferation of massive destructive weaponry," it
says, adding that it is "of vital importance to maintain and
strictly observe ABM."
</P>
<P>
The statement says that the establishment of the National
Missile Defense system (NMD) as planned by the United States makes
people "deeply worried."
</P>
<P>
China and Russia believe that the nature of NMD "is to seek
unilateral military and security advantages," which will "pose the
most grave adverse consequences not only to the national security
of Russia, China and other countries, but also to the security and
international strategic stability of the Unites States itself."

<TEXT>
<P>
-- The further and comprehensive development of economic, trade,
scientific and technological, and military-related technological
cooperation between China and Russia is vital for the expansion of
the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of cooperation based on
equality and trust.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state said they were satisfied with the
performance of prime ministers at regularly-held meetings, and
think the regular-meeting system plays a major role in promoting
bilateral cooperation in the areas of economy and trade, science
and technology, national defense, energy (including oil and gas
industry), transportation, nuclear industry, aviation and
aerospace, and banking.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are committed to widening cooperation in
specific areas to consolidate the strategic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia will explore possibilities for Russia's
participation in the development of China's western regions,
including the joint development of oil and gas resources and gas
pipeline laying.
</P>
<P>
Both wish to strengthen cooperation in the sectors of science
and technology, education, culture and sports.
</P>
<P>
-- The two countries believe that the Sino-Russian agreement
signed on December 9, 1999, for the joint use of certain islets in
border rivers and surrounding waters for economic purposes is
unprecedented. The smooth implementation of the agreement marked a
major step forward for the two countries to build their border
into a bridge of friendship.
</P>
<P>
In a constructive and pragmatic spirit, China and Russia will
continue their talks to speed up resolution of disputes over areas
still under negotiation. The status quo should be maintained for
the areas until a solution is reached.

-- Russia reiterated its consistent principled stance on the
Taiwan issue, saying that it recognizes the government of the
People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government
representing China, and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Russia will not support any form of Taiwan independence. It
supports the People's Republic of China's stance on not accepting
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Russia opposes Taiwan's entry into the United Nations or into
any international organization eligible only to sovereign states,
and will not sell weapons to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
China is truly grateful for Russia's faithful adherence to the
"one China" principle on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia believe that the Taiwan issue is China's
internal affair. Both believe that no outside force should be
allowed to interfere in resolving the Taiwan issue, and stress
that such an attempt can only add to the tension in the Asia-
Pacific region.

BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Facts have proven that the Sino-
Russian strategic partnership of cooperation is not only in the
fundamental interests of the two countries and the two peoples,
but also beneficial to world peace and stability, said Chinese
President Jiang Zemin here today.
</P>
<P>
Such a new strategic partnership is non-aligned, non-
confrontational, and is not targeted toward any third party, Jiang
said in response to a question while meeting the press jointly
with President Vladimir Putin following their formal talks.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that in recent years, the relationship between China
and Russia, two close neighbors and both permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council, has seen developing soundly.
</P>
<P>
With regard to bilateral ties, China and Russia will continue
to deepen their relationship and will become "good neighbors, good
partners and good friends," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
On the international stage, the two countries would continue to
devote themselves to the safeguarding of world peace and stability
and the establishment of a new political and economic world order.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Jiang noted the two countries would further expand
their cooperation in political, economic, military, and all other

<TEXT>
<P>
The survey revealed the biggest quarterly plunge in business
confidence in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The survey of nearly 800 businesses for the three months to
June showed that a net 42 percent of firms expect the general
business situation to worsen during the second half of the year
compared with a net 6 percent in the previous quarter that
expected it to get better.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular fall is blamed on a weak domestic economy, on
higher costs such as petrol, interest rates and the lower currency
increasing the cost of imported goods, tightening profitability
and some government policies.
</P>
<P>
Institute Director Alex Sundakov said that the survey does not
mean the New Zealand economy is slipping into recession but growth
is weak.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lead - Australia Announces Sanctions Against Fiji  (Adds Sanctions Details, More Downer Comments) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Australia announced Tuesday it
will recall its high commissioner to Fiji and terminate most non-
humanitarian aid programs to the Pacific nation as part of a range
of sanctions following the coup there.
</P>
<P>
All joint military exercises would be suspended and Fiji
national sporting teams would be banned, Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Fiji would be allowed to compete at the Sydney Olympics,
Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"The government is relieved by the long-overdue release of all
remaining hostages in Fiji but condemns the apparent consolidation
of unconstitutional and undemocratic rule in that country," Downer
said.
</P>
<P>
"On 29 May, I announced the government would take a range of
measures against Fiji in the event of an unacceptable outcome to
the coup," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those measures will now be implemented with immediate effect,"
Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said government-to-government cooperation under the
Australia-Fiji Trade and Economic Relations Agreement would be
suspended and most non-humanitarian aid activities would be
terminated.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a cut of around 30 percent to our bilateral
aid program to Fiji," he said.
</P>
<P>
All naval ship visits, senior officer visits and joint military
exercises had been suspended and a number of Australian defence
advisers also would be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Australia would encourage regional bodies to transfer planned
meetings to other countries, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia would continue to press for an early return
to constitutional rule in Fiji within the framework of the country
's 1997 constitution.
</P>
<P>
"Fiji now has a clear choice - return quickly to democracy or
forego indefinitely its former place as a valued and respected
member of the international community," Downer said.

<P>
HARARE, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year rate of
inflation for the month of June increased marginally by 0.6
percent to 59.3 percent despite the inflationary pressures
prevailing in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office Monday said the increases in
food prices accounted for 25.9 percentage points while non-food
items accounted for 33.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in year-on-year inflation was largely accounted
for by increases in the price of fruit and vegetables, bread and
cereals, drink and meat," the office said.
</P>
<P>
It said that "the increase in year-on-year inflation to 59.3
percent from 58.7 percent in May is explained by relatively sharp
increases in June's month-on-month inflation this year by 2.3
percent."

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Financial Market Vulnerable to Crisis: Think Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Increased foreign capital influx
into the South Korean stock market has made it vulnerable to a
possible crisis, said the Korea Center for International Finance (
KCIF) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a report, the KCIF, a government-run organization monitoring
finance and foreign exchange, said the government should make a
contingency plan to deal with a sudden exodus of foreign funds
from the domestic stock market.
</P>
<P>
Refusal to extend 50 billion U.S. dollars of short-term foreign
debt and a withdrawal of 20 percent of foreign investments could
push South Korea back into the economic chaos which it experienced
in late 1997 due to corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners invested 9.63 billion U.S. dollars in the first half
of this year, nearly doubling their total investments last year.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a government body has issued such
kind of warning although private economic institutes have warned
of a possible economic crisis before.
</P>
<P>
If stock values fall and the South Korean won depreciates,
foreign investors will withdraw their capital out of local stock
markets en masse, and the financial and foreign exchange markets
will be severely destabilized, said the think tank.
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of a second financial crisis cannot be
eliminated completely as local capital can also leave the nation
to minimize foreign exchange losses, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Korea Stock Exchange, as of late June foreign
investors owned 87.7 trillion won (79 billion dollars) worth of
stocks.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said foreigners would not pull out at
once since they want to avoid the double loss that would occur by
selling stocks and exchanging money.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Putin Describe Talks as Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin both described their
talks in the morning as "fruitful" as they met with the press here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in his opening remarks that the first visit to China
by Putin as Russia's president is an important event in the
history of China-Russia relations, and the two sides pay great
attention to it.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state held a friendly and practical discussion,
exchanged frank views on bilateral relations and cooperation in
various areas, and reached consensus.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed several agreements based on their talks,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were the Beijing Declaration and a joint
statement on the anti-ballistic missile issue, and two inter-
government agreements, one on joint energy development and the
other on the construction and operation of a fast-neutron
experimental reactor.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China also signed a cooperation pact with the
Russian Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that with the joint efforts of the two sides, the
strategic partnership between China and Russia will be deepened in
the new century.
</P>
<P>
Putin said that the aim of his current visit to China is to
confirm and consolidate the existing friendly relations between
the two countries. He stressed the friendly relations with China
should be attributed to the joint efforts of both Russia's first
president Boris Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the Russian side holds that it is most important to
form a plan ensuring the long-term development of the friendship
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Russia aims to carry out successful cooperation with China in
international relations and in security and economic areas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said his current visit to China has
gotten off to a fine start and has been "fruitful."

<HEADLINE> Talks to Be Held to Increase Sri Lankan Airline Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Ministry of Tourism
and Aviation is to conduct a series of bilateral negotiations with
aviation authorities in Australia, Britain, Indonesia and Yemen to
cater to increasing tourist traffic, the official Daily News
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Tourist traffic to and from these countries is on the rise and
the negotiations are aimed at increasing the existing capacity to
meet the demand," a senior official of the ministry was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry will hold negotiations with British
aviation authorities in September to ascertain the possibility of
increasing Sri Lankan Airline flights from its present nine
schedules. Talks will also be held with Indonesian authorities in
August followed by negotiations with Australia and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
The official added that 54 bilateral agreements had been
successfully signed with several countries around the globe, but
with escalating tourist traffic these agreements did not suffice
to meet the present demand.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan Airlines made its inaugural direct flight from
Colombo to the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka on July 1 this year as
a part of its efforts to make Colombo a regional aviation hub.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini Princess Faces Charges of Illegal Entry into U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. immigration judge said
Monday that a Bahraini princess who fled her country to marry a U.
S. Marine must face charges of illegally entering into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Judge Ignacio Fernandez refused to dismiss the charges against
the Bahraini princess, 19-year-old Al Khalifa, with a ruling that
prevents her from applying for permanent residency in the U.S.
without seeking political asylum.
</P>
<P>
She has up to a year under U.S. law to apply for political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
Al Khalifa, who faces extreme persecution for marrying a non-
Muslim if she returns to her country, is planning to apply for
political asylum in the U.S., said her attorney.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Bahraini Embassy in Washington said her
family is eager for her to return and that she would not face
persecution.
</P>
<P>
Al Khalifa, whose father is a cousin of Bahrain's head of state,
Emir Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, met U.S. Marine Jason Johnson last
year at a mall in the Bahraini capital of Manama, where the 25-
year-old Marine was assigned to a security unit.
</P>
<P>
As Johnson's deployment ended late last year, Al Khalifa used
forged U.S. military documents to fly to the U.S. on a commercial
airplane. She was discovered in Chicago by immigration officials .
</P>
<P>
The couple, who later got married in Las Vegas, now live at
Camp Pendleton, a Marine base 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of
San Diego in California.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini royalty belongs to Islam's mainstream Sunni sect and
rarely marry outside the family circle. Muslim women are not
allowed to marry non-Muslim men.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teenager in School Shooting Remains at Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in the south
Seattle suburb of Renton are still on the lookout Monday evening
for a 13-year-old boy who "started yelling" and then allegedly
opened fire with a handgun in the cafeteria where he was attending
summer school.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the incident Monday morning, but
officials were concerned about the boy, who fled after the
shooting and remained at large hours later.
</P>
<P>
"We really want to find him before he does something else
stupid or something happens to him," said King County Sheriff's
Department spokesman John Urquhart.
</P>
<P>
He described the suspect as a white boy with dirty blonde hair
streaked with purple or blue. The boy was still believed to be
carrying a handgun, which apparently belonged to the boy's
grandmother, according to a TV report Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred at A.W. Dimmitt Middle School, where the
boy is among some 200 students enrolled for summer classes.
</P>
<P>
Urquhart said the boy walked into the cafeteria during a break
period before lunch, stood up on a table, shot once into the
ceiling and ordered all the students to get up on the cafeteria's
stage.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, students in the cafeteria -- and there was
quite a few of them -- went in pretty much all different
directions," Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
When a teacher shouted to the boy that police were coming, he
ran, Brittany said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Trade Surplus Hits 2.15 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea registered a trade
surplus of 2.15 billion U.S. dollars last month, the Korean
Customs Service announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In June, the nation's exports hit 15.3 billion dollars, up 19.4
percent from the same month last year while imports were 13.15
billion, up 29 percent, with a trade surplus of 2.15 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest monthly trade surplus in the first six
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, South Korean exports stood at 82.
84 billion dollars while imports amounted to 78.59 billion, up 25.
5 percent and 44.7 percent respectively from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the trade surplus decreased 7.42 billion dollars from
the same period a year earlier, down to 4.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
The customs service said high oil prices were the biggest
variable diminishing the trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
The service attributed the dropping trade surplus to increasing
imports, especially oil imports, which hit 11.71 billion in the
first six months of the year, a rise of 105 percent from the same
time of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Hughes Reports Gain in Sales, Loss in Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Hughes Electronics Corp.
Monday reported a rise in sales but a loss in profit for the
second quarter, according to news release from the El Segundo,
California-based company.
</P>
<P>
Hughes said its sales rose to more than 1.8 billion dollars
from about 1.3 billion dollars in the same quarter a year ago,
while its net loss narrowed to 69 million dollars from 97 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hughes said its smaller loss was due primarily to a 76-million-
dollar charge taken in last year's second quarter at its satellite-
making business, which is being sold to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Hughes posted a nearly 45-percent gain in second-quarter
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, to
179.6 million dollars from 124.3 million dollars
</P>
<P>
DirecTV, a satellite pay-TV service, was seeing subscriber
growth in urban and suburban markets after recently gaining the
ability to provide local TV channels, said Hughes Chairman
Michael Smith in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Hughes' satellite-TV units saw second-quarter sales rise to 1.2
billion dollars from 870 million dollars a year ago, but the group
had negative cash flow of 14 million dollars, vs. 11.5 million
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
At June 30, DirecTV had 8.7 million subscribers, including
about 435,000 from the Primestar service it acquired.

<HEADLINE> West Beats East to Win WNBA All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Despite the absence of best
player Cynthia Cooper, the West outscored the East 73-61 to take
the WNBA All-Star game in Phoenix Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Lisa Leslie from the Los Angeles Sparks scored a record of 16
points and grabbed six rebounds as the West established their
leading position 40-33 at half break.
</P>
<P>
The outcome could have been worse, like last year's 18-point
win by the West in the inaugural game, but the West committed 23
turnovers against 15 for the East.
</P>
<P>
Tina Thompson, Cooper's Houston teammate, had 13 points and a
record 11 rebounds to garner the MVP honors. Mwadi Mabika, Leslie'
s teammate in the Sparks, and Yolanda Griffith of Sacramento each
scored 10 points.
</P>
<P>
Taj McWilliams of Orlando, who finished with 10 points, made
two free throws with 2:47 to play to bring the East within 66-59.
</P>
<P>
Tari Phillips of New York, who also had 10 points, scored 55
seconds later to cut the deficit to five.
</P>
<P>
But Griffith, who displaced Cooper, a victim of a sprained
ankle, as the league MVP last year, made a layup with 1:37 to play,
opening a 68-61 lead, and Brandy Reed, Griffith and Ticha
Penicheiro of Sacramento each made a free throw down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
Reed, a Phoenix forward left off the West roster in voting, was
added as a 12th player by the league last week to avoid a fan
revolt in the host city. But she fizzled on the court, shooting 1-
for-11 and turning the ball over three times.

<HEADLINE> Restructuring Plan Unveiled to Revitalize Thai Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand (
SET) on Tuesday unveiled a restructuring plan that will split the
bourse into two entities.
</P>
<P>
The first entity will be an operating company to run the daily
affairs of the stock market, while the second will be a foundation
focusing on the development of the local capital market, according
to a SET statement.
</P>
<P>
The exchange's operating unit, which will be a public company
whose shareholders and a board of governors will be current
members of the exchange, will take over the exchange's 10 billion
baht (250 million U.S. dollars) in assets. The board, however,
would have to decide whether to list the company, it said.
</P>
<P>
The unit charged with developing the exchange's business will
operate like a foundation, and use some of the operating company's
assets to build the bourse's infrastructure, it stated.
</P>
<P>
Under the changes, which need a parliamentary amendment of the
Stock Market Act, the exchange's regulatory function would be
separated from its management role, said it.
</P>
<P>
"The SET was set up both as a regulator and operator of the
market. Splitting into an operating company would put the service
focus a lot more clearly on the operations," SET president
Vicharat Vadakan was quoted as saying by the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It would also put SET management on a clearer frame of
accountability to the board and shareholders, and regulatory
functions would largely be placed in the hands of the Securities
and Exchange Commission," Vicharat remarked.
</P>
<P>
"We will retain only that amount of regulation of our members
in order to ensure the integrity of the market," he added.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's benchmark SET index has dropped 35.6 percent this
year, making it the world's fourth worst-performing stock market.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government and
people feel happy about the great achievements China has made in
its reform and opening up and modernization program, said
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Meeting outgoing Chinese Ambassador Yan Ting'ai Monday, Hun Sen
said that "a prosperous and powerful China benefits peace and
development in both Asia and world."
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of China's policy of not devaluing Renminbi,
the Chinese currency, during the Asian financial crisis in the
1998-1999 period. "This is a responsible attitude and has made
great contributions to the southeast Asian countries to tide over
the crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
The traditional and long-standing friendship between Cambodia
and China has been further enhanced in the new period, he said.
The friendship not only meets the fundamental interests of the two
peoples, but also benefits the unity and cooperation among the
developing countries, Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Cambodian government and people, the prime
minister expressed his heart-felt thanks to the Chinese government
and people for sincere support and assistance to Cambodia's
realization of peace and reconstruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Taufik Hidayat
has confirmed his participation in the Sanyo Indonesia Open
badminton tournament, which starts on Wednesday, after previous
reports that he might withdraw due to a back injury.
</P>
<P>
Taufik said he and the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI)
official doctor Michael Triangto had met orthopedic specialist Dr.
Chaehab.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Chaehab said I can compete in the event but I must be very
careful with my movement during games. I still feel the pain but
it's not a big deal," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Taufik said he wanted to retain his title in the five-star
tournament despite his injury. The 18-year-old defeated his
teammate Budi Santoso in last year's final in Bali.
</P>
<P>
"Of course I want to retain my title. Just wait and see my
performance at the event," he said.
</P>

<P>
PBSI official in charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar said that he had received a report from the
medical team saying that Taufik was fit to play.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Russian Presidents Hold Formal Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin held formal talks this
morning at the Great Hall of the People, following more than two
hours of private talks.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in 1989
described his talks with the former Soviet Union leader as "the
end of the past and the beginning of the future."
</P>
<P>
At a time when the Sino-Russian relationship is poised to enter
the new century, Jiang said, his talk with Putin can be described
as "a pivotal conversation that inherits from the past and opens a
new chapter for the future."
</P>
<P>
Putin thanked Jiang for his invitation of him to China and for
the hospitable reception he received here. He told Jiang he was
delighted to spend a good time with friends in the friendly land
of China.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Russia attaches utmost importance to developing
the Russian-Chinese relations. He attributed the growth of the
well-grounded bilateral relationship to the unremitting efforts
made by Russia's first president Boris Yeltsin and President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Putin said his ongoing mission to China aims to consolidate the
existing good Russian-Chinese relationship and craft a blueprint
for long-term development of the ties.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that Jiang and Putin had conferred with
each other since Putin assumed the Russian presidency. The two
heads of state had their first meeting early this month when
attending the Shanghai Five Summit in Tajikistan's capital city
Dushanbe.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Strives for Emergence of Drug-Free Yangon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is striving for the
emergence of a drug-free region for Yangon division, estimating
that it will be realized after the end of the country's 15-year
plan (1999-2014) of narcotic drug eradication.
</P>
<P>
Measures are being coordinated for implementing the first five-
year project (1999-2004) of the 15-year drug eradication plan in
the Yangon division, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Yangon division commander Major-General Khin Maung Than,
the report said measures to be taken for the short-term five-year
project cover education, treatment, rehabilitation and control of
drug.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made in cooperation with departments
concerned in the move area-wise in towns and districts, Khin Maung
Than stressed at a coordination meeting here Monday regarding the
plan.
</P>
<P>
He also called for endeavors to combat narcotic drugs from all
sectors in implementing the project as a national task and to
develop the socio-economic life of the national people of the
border areas and to end poppy cultivation in the areas.
</P>
<P>
After declaring Mongla region in eastern Shan state as a "drug-
free zone in April 1997, Myanmar started implementing the 15-year
plan in 1999, aimed at total eradication of narcotic drug in the
whole country. The plan, which costs 255 million U.S. dollars,
covers 51 drug cultivating and producing townships.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that up to now there remains 89,500 hectares of
poppy cultivation and a total of 86,537 drug addicts in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
As part of its drug control efforts, Myanmar has established
six treatment centers including Yangon, catering to 2,000 addicts
annually, and eight rehabilitation centers for ex-addicts.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics regarding its law enforcement
efforts, in 1999, the Myanmar authorities seized 1,447.55 kilos of
opium, 272.94 kilos of heroin, 274.48 kilos of marijuana, 278.97
liters of phensedyl, 262,542.5 liters of precursor chemicals as
well as 28.75 million tablets of stimulant drugs, destroying 12
heroin refineries.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the authorities confiscated in
the first five months of this year a total of 1,044 kilos of
narcotic drugs including 678.4 kilos of opium, 20.2 kilos of
heroin and 330.75 kilos of marijuana as well as 3,999 liters of
precursor chemicals and 7.358 million tablets of stimulant drugs
with a total of 1,586 drug-related cases exposed and 2,170 drug
offenders punished.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan Govt Hopeful of All-Party Support for New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has said her government is hopeful that it will
receive the support of all major political parties to have its
proposed new constitution adopted in Parliament to resolve the
long-running ethnic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that all parties, specially the main
opposition United National Party (UNP), will extend their
committed support to make this a reality when it (the new
constitution) is presented in Parliament soon," said Kumaratunga
on Monday, when addressing the inauguration of a project to
provide housing, vocational training and scholarships to members
and families of the service personnel serving in Sri Lanka's north
and east to fight Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said that the government's peaceful negotiations
with 13 political parties on the constitutional reforms is a
landmark approach towards achieving lasting peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
She said that the majority of the Sinhalese and Tamils and
Muslims had recognized their efforts as being sincere and endorsed
them at the last nine provincial and national elections that have
been held.
</P>
<P>
The president has said she would present the proposed new
constitution before Parliament in early August and push it through
before the dissolving of Parliament on August 24. The new
constitution aims to devolve more powers to regions including one
administered by minority Tamils to partly meet the rebel demand of
independence.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Tiger rebels are fighting for a separate homeland called
Eelam for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The government of the ruling People's Alliance and the UNP
reached consensus on the new constitution early this month after
four months of peace talks. Kumaratunga is currently talking with
minority Tamil parties in a bid to hammer out consensus on the new
constitution.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Officials Agree to Allow Flexibility on Tariff Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Senior economic officials of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed to
allow member countries more flexibility on when they participate
in a tariff reduction scheme, a Thai official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who are attending an ASEAN economic conference
from July 17 to 19 here, will establish a protocol to amend the
Common Effective Preference Tariffs (CEPT) scheme, a tariff-
reduction program that lies at the heart of the ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA), Director-general Karun Kittistaporn of the Business
Economics Department said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The protocol will be forwarded for formal approval to the
upcoming ASEAN economic ministers' meeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand,
in October, said Karun, who heads the Thai delegation at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The proposal of readjusting the CEPT scheme follows Malaysia's
decision to continue to protect its car industry.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has said it intends to delay the transfer of its
vehicle parts from the temporary exclusion list for tariff cuts to
the inclusion list, which was required by the CEPT.
</P>
<P>
The failure to adhere to the original CEPT scheme calls for a
formal regulatory adjustment to the scheme, Karun said.
</P>
<P>
"Since ASEAN works on a compromise basis, the senior officials
have agreed to offer flexible conditions to allow members to delay
transferring their products from the temporary exclusion lists to
the inclusion lists for tariff reduction," he remarked.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, any ASEAN members requesting a delay in
participating in CEPT would be obliged to provide financial
compensation in return as a sign of good will.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN member countries include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and
Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Cut Financial Support for Japan-based U.S. Military Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo and Washington have reached a
basic agreement on Japan's annual reduction of its host-nation
support for the U.S. military facilities in Japan by 2.5-3.0
billion yen (23-28 million U.S. dollars) under a new five-year
agreement starting next April, local media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was a compromise of the U.S. in an attempt to
avert public criticism over the financial burden of maintaining U.
S. facilities in Japan and to ease growing anti-U.S. sentiment in
Okinawa Prefecture, where U.S. servicemen have recently been
involved in a number of incidents, the report quoted government
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government currently pays roughly 180 billion yen
(1.7 billion dollars) each year in support of the 47,000 U.S.
troops stationed in Japan under a 1987 agreement to help the U.S.
defray part of the military upkeep cost in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who will meet in Tokyo on Thursday, are expected to seek
a final accord when Japanese and U.S. foreign and defense
ministers hold a "two-plus-two" meeting in September, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Mori and Clinton are scheduled to meet in Tokyo prior to the
three-day summit of the Group of Eight (G-8) major nations, which
opens Friday in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had objected to any reduction in the host-nation
support, while pressure from lawmakers led Japan to call for
streamlining and cost-cutting after the current accord expires on
March 31.
</P>
<P>
The accord will affect the Special Measures Agreement, signed
by Japan and the U.S. in 1987, which stipulates that Japan cover
all yen-based costs incurred by U.S. forces in Japan for labor,
utilities and training relocation.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the basic agreement will realize the cutback
by implementing a reduction of up to 10 percent for the upper
limit on utility costs at U.S. bases, with the U.S. paying for all
costs for off-base housing.
</P>
<P>
The host-nation support, dubbed "sympathy" budget in Japan,
began in fiscal 1978 when the U.S. economy was foundering and the
cost of living in Japan skyrocketed amid the country's robust
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to Be Tried Next Month : Attorney General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman insisted that former president Soeharto be
present in court when his corruption trial begins, possibly next
month.
</P>
<P>
"If Soeharto cannot attend the trial because of illness or
other factors, then the trial will have to be delayed until he can
appear in court," leading local newspapers Tuesday quoted Marzuki
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the former president earlier warned that their 79-
year-old client was physically unfit to stand trial, saying he has
deteriorating speech capability.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki has vowed to complete the dossier on the former tyrant
by August 10 with the trial expected soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
The team of prosecutors assigned to handle the case will soon
put the final touches on the dossier and the Attorney General
Office will write up the formal indictment next week, said Marzuki.
</P>
<P>
"We will make an announcement next week on the district court
selected to try the case, and the name of the prosecutor to handle
the case," he added.
</P>
<P>
With little cooperation from Soeharto, the investigating team
has built its case based on testimony from more than 100 people,
including his children and cronies and cabinet ministers who
served under him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Development Audit Agency (BPKP) is now in
the
final stages of calculating the value of Soeharto's ill-gotten
wealth, Attorney General Office spokesman Yushar Yahaya said on
Monday, adding that the results are expected before the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
He said the Attorney General Office has seized a number of
documents on Soeharto's accumulation of wealth, which reportedly
inflicted huge losses on the state during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
He said the state prosecutors will soon seize more of Soeharto'
s assets, but he declined to name any properties or companies.
</P>
<P>
"They will be seized and held before the Soeharto files are
submitted to court," he added.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid has said Soeharto's wealth is about
45 billion U.S. dollars. The Time magazine last year put the
Soeharto clan's wealth at closer to 15 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rules Out Foreign Troops For Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian top government
officials Monday reaffirmed that the government will reject
foreign intervention in settling the communal clashes in the
ravaged islands of Maluku.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid disclosed that United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan had telephoned him days earlier and
told him "there had been suggestions about the need for foreign
troops in Maluku."
</P>
<P>
Wahid pointed out that as a sovereign state, Indonesia is fully
responsible for its domestic affairs and it had taken several
measures to end the conflict in Maluku, including imposing a state
of civil emergency in the provinces of Maluku and North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
The president also said, "Kofi will try to ensure that these
proposals (for foreign troops in Maluku) will not be put on the
agenda of the U.N. Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Admitting that events in Maluku had international repercussions,
and thus the whole country needed to work hard to resolve the
crisis, Wahid insisted that Indonesia would reject any foreign
involvement in quelling the fighting in the spice islands.
</P>
<P>
"Only when we are overwhelmed, maybe we will scream for
logistics and equipment only, no more than that. It is the maximum
that we can accept," the president was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab also ruled out
international intervention in Maluku and North Maluku, but said
Jakarta would welcome humanitarian aid from abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said that some religious leaders in the bloodied islands
have asked the government to invite international forces to help
restore security and order there.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue not to accept that because foreign
intervention is negative in nature and could undermine our
sovereignty," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Shihab said the government will not invite foreign troops,
including a U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
"This is our internal problem. Foreign intervention would give
the impression that the government has failed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister underlined his comments by warning of harsh action
against international forces or groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We will not hesitate to arrest such groups," he was quoted by
the Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite the state of civil emergency in Maluku and North Maluku,
which took effect last month, violence has continued unabated,
particularly in Ambon, capital of Maluku, and the surrounding
areas.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 people have been killed over the past week and more
than 3,000 people have died since the communal violence erupted in
January 1999.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Announces Another Oil Production Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The OPEC secretariat announced here
Monday that the bloc will boost its oil production by 500,000
barrels a day from the end of July if oil prices remain above the
desired range of 22-28 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the secretariat said if petroleum prices
continue to remain at the current levels till July 28, members of
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will
increase their output.
</P>
<P>
Crude price hit 28.84 dollars a barrel last Friday, its 10th
straight day above 28 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Under OPEC's so-called "price-band" mechanism designed to
regulate global oil prices, the producers are to raise output
targets by 500,000 barrels a day if the price of the reference
basket of OPEC crude oils exceeds 28 dollars per barrel for 20
consecutive trading days.
</P>
<P>
OPEC President Ali Rodriguez has told oil ministers of the
group to be "prepared to take the necessary steps to raise output.
"
</P>
<P>
If the plan is implemented, production targets for OPEC members,
except Iraq, will rise from 25.4 million to 25.9 million barrels a
day. The additional 500,000 barrels will be attributed among
member countries at the range of increase between 1.96 to 1.97
percent.
</P>
<P>
To contain the rocketing world oil prices caused by
insufficient output increases by OPEC, the group raised output two
times this year in vain.
</P>
<P>
On July 3, Saudi Arabia signaled a daily production increase of
500,000 barrels. Reports said that oil companies in the kingdom
have already started to raise production since last week.
</P>
<P>
The move has temporarily brought down oil prices on the world
market, but the prices bounced back after Venezuela, Iran and some
other OPEC members voiced opposition to the production increase.
</P>
<P>
These countries believe that the hike of oil prices was sparked
by the high prices of petroleum products, gasoline in particular,
on the U.S. and European markets rather than lack of oil supply.
</P>
<P>
After OPEC's announcement, crude futures traded in London
dipped to 28.71 dollars a barrel on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Albania Becomes WTO Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Albania became a full member of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday, Ermelinda Meksi, the
minister of Economic Cooperation and Trade, announced.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the move will not only help the country to boost
its exports to other WTO members but also represents a giant step
toward signing an agreement on association with European Union (EU)
."
</P>
<P>
Albania applied for joining the WTO in 1992 but the
negotiations with the organization broke off because of the
political and economic crisis in the country during 1996 and 1997.
In 1998, the government set up a permanent secretariat to handle
its relations with the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Not to Run for Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu announced on Monday that he will not run for
another term of presidency.
</P>
<P>
In a live broadcast on television, he said that his decision
will enable him to wage a just and firm struggle against
corruption of all kinds in the country.
</P>
<P>
The president also decided not to run for a parliament seat or
head of any political party.
</P>
<P>
But he pledged that he will dedicate his life to protecting the
interests of the country and the people when and if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu's decision surprised the political circles in
Romania. Mincea Ionescu-Quintus, chairman of the National Liberal
Party, described it as a brave decision which will win respects of
the people.
</P>
<P>
However, Teodor Melescanu, chairman of the Alliance for Romania,
holds an opposite viewpoint, saying that the decision means that
the president failed in office for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The presidential and parliament elections are scheduled for the
end of 2000. Constantinescu has been regarded as a strong
candidate for the next presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A series of 15 sand storms have
hit large areas of China last spring, and more are expected over
the next few years, according to a Chinese meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Outlook weekly cited statistics from the
State Climatic Center as indicating that the sand storms in China
this year were the most serious in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
A vast region, including northwest, north and northeast China,
as well as regions along the Yellow, Huaihe and Yangtze rivers,
suffered from the sand and dust blown on the wind.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Yu, an expert at the center, there have been
nearly 70 sand storms in northwest China over the past five
decades, and 21 in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
"The trend will continue," said Lu Juntian, another expert.
</P>
<P>
"There have been five periods with high frequencies of sand
storms in China over the past 1700 years, with each period lasting
about 90 years," Lu said, adding that probably China is about to
enter a new period of frequent sand storms.
</P>
<P>
The sand and dust have caused serious air pollution,
difficulties in everyday life, and even casualties and economic
losses. This spring alone, sand storms caused 30 million yuan (
about 3.6 million US dollars) in direct economic losses to the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China.

<HEADLINE> Sailing Organization Confirms Atlantic Crossing Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The catamaran Club Med broke
the sailing world record for an Atlantic crossing by nearly two
days, the World Speed Sailing Record Council said in a statement
received here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 33.5-meter catamaran, piloted by New Zealander Grant Dalton
and Frenchman Bruno Peyron, started the crossing last month from
Cadiz, Spain, and completed the journey at San Salvador, Bahamas,
in 10 days, 14 hours 53 minutes 44 seconds, the British-based
council said.
</P>
<P>
The yacht also set a new world record for the farthest distance
sailed in 24 hours, at 719.6 miles (1,158.8 kilometers).
</P>
<P>
With the crossing, the yacht has won a place in The Race _ a
nonstop, round-the-world yacht race that begins in Barcelona,
Spain, on December 31, which offers a prize of two million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The previous record for Atlantic crossing from Spain to San
Salvador was 12 days 12:25:26, set in 1988 by Serge Madec, while
American Steve Fossett held the 24-hour speed record for covering
667 miles in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Orlando Magic Keeps Free-agent Amaechi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The Orlando Magic has the
promise of John Amaechi to stay with the franchise as the free
agent declined to join the ranks of reigning champions the Los
Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
And it's a blessing for the Magic especially after it failed to
lure Tim Duncan from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
"Against the counsel of my agent, sisters and best friend,
against everything that says I'm not making the best of the
situation, against my own best financial sense, I'm re-signing
because I think the Magic need me more than the Lakers," Amaechi
said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Amaechi, the 2.08-meter center, turns down a six-year, 17
million US dollars guaranteed contract offer from the Lakers to
sign a short-term deal with the Magic. He averaged 10.5 points, 3.
3 rebounds and 21.1 minutes in 80 games last season.
</P>
<P>
However, Amaechi, 29, can make more in a multiyear deal with
the Magic than with the Lakers - as much as 27 million US dollars
over six years, but not until after this season on the condition
that he won't get injured and Orlando will reward his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
The Magic, who already have commitments from incoming free
agents Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady, can bump Amaechi's salary
only 20 percent for the upcoming season, roughly 600,000 U.S.
dollars, while the Lakers could have paid him 2.2 million dollars
in the first year of a deal.

<HEADLINE> Gascoigne Joins Everton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Paul Gascoigne has left English
premier league soccer Middlesbrough to join Everton on a free
transfer.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne, who passed a routine medical and signed a two year
contract on Monday, admitted that the club takes a gamble on him.
"They are taking a big gamble on me," he confessed.
</P>
<P>
He appeared alongside Everton owner Bill Kenwright at a press
conference insisting he can still make an impact in the
Premiership, saying: "I am looking forward to a massive challenge
at a massive club."
</P>
<P>
"Everyone says I've got no brains and my brains are in my feet,
so I will let my feet do the talking at Everton. I know I can't
afford to let anybody down. It is a big gamble for everyone at
the club, and I know I will be followed all the time, but it is up
to me to keep my nose clean."
</P>
<P>
And he even refused to give up on England and added: "The
target is still to get back into the England squad and I don't see
any reason why I can't do that if I stay injury free."
</P>
<P>
"I've already got my eye on an Everton season ticket for Kevin
Keegan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne will fly to Italy immediately to join Everton's pre-
season training camp in Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
And he already has his sights set on one fixture, revealing: "
Bill Kenwright has given me book on derby games, and I can't wait
to play against Liverpool, if selected."
</P>
<P>
Kenwright was elated at Everton's headline grabbing capture.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We've got a great footballer here. It was important
we got a headliner, but we have not just got him for that. The
most important and dominant thing when we met was his passion. It
was a fantastic passion, and of course he has an extraordinary
relationship with our manager. "
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne only started nine league and cup games and made two
appearances as a substitute for Middlesbrough last season after a
three million pounds move from Rangers, and did not play again
after breaking his arm against Aston Villa on February 14.
</P>
<P>
The chance to play again under Smith, his manager and mentor at
Rangers, was clearly a big factor in Gascoigne's decision to head
to Goodison Park.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne's long-term representative Mel Stein said: "They are
like father and son. They have a terrific relationship. It's a
mutual admiration society."

WASHINGTON, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Shareef Abdur-Rahim of the

with 20.3 points per game and rebounding at 10.1 per game.
</P>
<P>
His agent, Aaron Goodwin, said last week his client would be
picked for the team, which was confirmed by the USA Basketball's
announcement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Team USA will begin training on August 26, in Maui, Hawaii,
and plays its first exhibition game on August 31, against the

<HEADLINE> Brown Unveils Huge Boost For Public Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor Gordon Brown has
unveiled a massive multi-billion pound cash injection for public
services, laying the ground for the next general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Brown told House of Commons Tuesday that police, hospitals,
schools and public transport will all see substantial rises in
their budgets for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Outlining his long-awaited Comprehensive Spending Review, the
chancellor said the state of Britain's public finances is strong
and that unemployment stands at its lowest level for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He said overall department expenditure limits will rise from
195 billion pounds this year to 246 billion by 2003/04. Total
spending, which includes welfare and interest payments on debt,
will rise from 372 billion pounds this year to 440 billion pounds
by 2003/04.
</P>
<P>
Brown also confirmed net capital investment will more than
double to 18 billion pounds by 2004 and that current spending will
rise by 2.5 percent above inflation.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that further details will be rolled out with
the publication of the 10-year plans for transport later this week
and for the National Health Service next week.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the announcement will
provide a badly needed fillip for the Labor government after
recent setbacks, culminating in the lead of Tony Blair's memo
revealing fears that he appears to be "out of touch."

<HEADLINE> Britain Recalls Fijian High Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain Tuesday recalled its high
commissioner in Fiji for consultations amid government unease at
the deal to end the hostage crisis in Suva, the Fijian capital.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Officer Minister John Battle announced that the British
High Commissioner in Suva Michael Dibben is being recalled to
London for consultations.
</P>
<P>
"We are disturbed that the deal struck to secure the release of
the hostages abrogates the 1997 Constitution and leaves almost
half the population of Fiji without democratic representation,"
Battle said.
</P>
<P>
He said relief at the safe release of all the hostages should
not obscure the fact that the crisis for Fiji is not over.
</P>
<P>
"I am discussing next steps with my Commonwealth and other
international partners, and will also consult our high
commissioner on his return," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
That step meant Britain joined Australia and New Zealand in
recalling its high commissioner from Fiji in protest at the latest
developments in the country's political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Fijian high commissioner in London has also been summoned
to the Foreign Office to be told of Britain's concerns about the
formation of a new government in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's new cabinet, announced earlier Tuesday, excluded all
ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand have already imposed a range of
sanctions on Fiji until full democracy is restored.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the European Union have also threatened
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Suspends Part of Helms-Burton Law for Another Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday suspended the application of part of the Helms-Burton law
for another six months, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law aims at toughening embargo against Cuba by
prohibiting foreign companies to invest or purchase property
seized after the 1959 revolution in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Western allies have strongly opposed the law since it was
passed in 1996 and Clinton has suspended it every six months.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that suspending the law
was in the "national interest."

<HEADLINE> Gore Shows Progress in Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
showed progress in national polls before the national conventions
of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are held.
</P>
<P>
Two polls released Monday demonstrated that Democratic
presidential candidate Gore has closed the gap with Republican
rival George W. Bush after trailing in the majority of polls taken
over the past couple of months.
</P>
<P>
According to a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, Texas Governor Bush
has the support of 48 percent while Gore enjoys 46 percent among
likely voters. Earlier this month, Bush led Gore 50 percent to 41
percent in that poll, but Gore has moved ahead among women voters
and pulled even among independents.
</P>
<P>
A CBS News poll also showed the race equally close among
registered voters, 43 percent for Bush and 41 percent for Gore. In
May, Bush was at 47 percent and Gore at 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
The national convention of the Republican Party is scheduled
from July 31 to August 3 in Philadelphia, and the Democratic Party
will hold its national convention from August 14 to 17 in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst said Gore's emphasis on prosperity during
the Clinton-Gore administration and his plans for continuing it
have helped in his progress in polls.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic National Committee launched a 17-state
advertising effort in early June designed to revive Gore's lagging
campaign. Vice President Gore also visited several states in a "
prosperity tour" to attract the voters' attention.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: CJD Deaths Will Rise By 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Deaths from the human form of mad
cow disease are expected to increase by up to 30 percent over
coming years, British scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Between two and four more people will probably die from new
variant CJD in addition to the 10 to 15 deaths currently
experienced each year, said Professor Peter Smith.
</P>
<P>
Smith, acting head of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee, told BBC Radio 4' Today program that this is borne out
by a "statistically significant" increase in cases.
</P>
<P>
"There are now 76 definite and probable cases, including seven
probables still alive," the committee said in a statement released
recently.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a trend upwards and we have just seen analyses
showing that that trend upwards now is formally statistically
significant and is unlikely to be due to chance," it added.
</P>
<P>
Last month the government launched an urgent inquiry into a
cluster of CJD deaths around the small village of Queniborough in
the central English county of leicestershire.
</P>
<P>
Robert Will, head of the government's CJD surveillance unit,
said at the weekend that baby food and school meals may have been
a major source for the Queniborough outbreak.

<TEXT>
<P>
"This will continue until a ceasefire accord is made. That's
our organization's proposal at the negotiation table", said Ivan
Rios, guerrilla coordinator of subject-matter at the peace
process table.
</P>
<P>
FARC made last week attacks against 5 towns in Tolima and Huila
departments, west Colombia, in which 13 police, 5 guerrillas and 4
civilians were killed, and around 100 dwellings were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
High Commissioner for Peace, Camilo Gomez, expressed Tuesday
that only when the debate at the negotiation table is opened,
will it be possible to know the position of the parties which, for
now, remains in reserve.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, negotiators have already forwarded their stance.
The government wishes for a general ceasing of hostilities,
including kidnappings and extorsions which are some of the
guerrillas' main finance sources.
</P>
<P>
Colombian has been affected by a nearly four-decade long civil
war, which caused at least 35,000 dead in the last 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in Mexico to Go Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will close year 2000
with 9.2 percent of inflation rate, below the 10 percent target
established at the year's beginning, said Tuesday President of
Bank of Mexico Gullermo Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
July's inflation will be of 0.4 percent, below June's 0.59
percent, predicted Ortiz to the press.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the change of government when new President Vicente
Fox takes possession, coming December 1, Ortiz discarded an
alteration in the central bank's targets, like achieving 3 percent
inflation for year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz confirmed he's met president elect's economic team for a
tight cooperation in finance and monetary matters.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the exchange market, Ortiz considered uncertainty
overcome with the recovery of stability of Mexico's currency,
the peso, at 9.31 units per dollar, which broke the 10 peso
barrier before the July 2 elections.
</P>
<P>
Ortiz rejected that Mexico's economy is overheated owing to
second three-monthly period results, although there persist risks
due to excessive increase in consumption.
</P>
<P>
He discarded that an eventual rise in interest rates in United
States, of 0.25 percent at end of August or 0.50 at end year 2000
would bear negative repercussions for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
United States is Mexico's main trading partner.

<HEADLINE> Two Issues Remain Unsolved in Burundi Peace Process: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela said Wednesday there are still two issues
left unresolved in the Burundi peace negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The two issues, namely who is to lead the transitional
government, and the signing of a power-sharing ceasefire agreement,
have to be agreed upon by the warring parties, said Mandela, who
attended a one-day consultative summit in Tanzania's northern town
of Arusha on the Burundi peace negotiation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We've asked the Burundians themselves to agree as to who is to
lead the transitional government," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He added once the two issues are resolved, the way will be
crystal clear for a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
As to the effect of the absence of the rebel National
Liberation Force, a splinter Hutu group of the Hutu People's
Liberation Party (PALIPEHUTU) at Wednesday's meeting, Mandela said:
"Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye ( leader of another major rebel group
CNDD-FDD ) was here for the meeting, and he is leading the largest
rebel group inside Burundi and was very supportive."
</P>
<P>
He also said a draft peace agreement was distributed to all
parties in preparation for the final signing, which is scheduled
to fall on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in Burundi has claimed at least 200,000 lives, mostly
civilians, since it began in October 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated the country's first democratically elected president
Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
Mandela took over as mediator last December from late Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere and has been trying to speed up the talks,
which have dragged on since July 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mandela invited all the Hutu rebel groups that had been
previously excluded to take part in the peace process.
Negotiations over the past 24 months in Arusha have worked out the
outlines of a peace deal.

ADDIS ABABA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has claimed that
Eritrea is impeding communications between Eritrean prisoners of
war (POW) in Ethiopia and their relatives in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Walta Information Center (WIC) Wednesday quoted Hagos Gemechu,
chief of the Tigray Branch of the Ethiopian Red Cross, as saying
that thousands of Eritrean POWs have written letters to their
relatives in Eritrea, but received no reply so far.
</P>
<P>
The POWs have stopped writing for fear that it might endanger
the safety of their loved ones, Hagos said. But he did not say
when the Eritrean soldiers were captured.
</P>
<P>
Hagos called on the International Committee of Red Cross to
exert pressure on the Eritrean government to allow communications
between the POWs and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a ceasefire agreement in mid-June

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Vows to Ensure Peaceful Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour on Wednesday expressed his government's determination to
ensure the forthcoming general elections to be conducted
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Addressing members of the House of Representatives in the semi-
autonomous region of Tanzania, the president urged the people not
to be swayed by radical speeches given by some politicians, saying
that his government will no longer tolerate acts to plunge the
nation into violence.
</P>
<P>
"We will act tough against those who will disrupt peace and
unity," Salmin stressed, adding that the Zanzibaris will commit a
big "sin" to entertain violence and later seek "sanctuary" in
other nations.
</P>
<P>
The isles leader said the elections, to be held on October 29
simultaneously in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania, are aimed at
enabling the people to pick their suitable leaders and should not,
under any circumstances, be taken as a ticket to seek political
revenge.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Salmin also reminded the MPs that the future of
Zanzibar lies on the Zanzibaris themselves, warning that the
people should be careful to avoid playing with a political fire,
saying "it is dangerous and can burn".
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania after a revolt in 1964 that ousted the sultan
and Omani Arabs who ruled the islands.
</P>
<P>
It is a semi-autonomous state with its own government and
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Salmin became the Zanzibar President in 1990, and was reelected
in 1995.

At a press conference after the summit of the Community of the
Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP), Chissano expressed his
willingness to open dialogs with Afonso Dhlakama, whose Renamo-
Electoral Union coalition continues to reject the results of last
December's general elections.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Mozambican president appointed last
Friday governors for Mozambique's 10 provinces, ignoring Renamo's
demand that he should choose opposition members to govern the six
provinces it won in the December ballot.
</P>
<P>
Dhlakama and his party are "free to do what they want", the
Mozambican president said, dismissing fears of instability in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Dhlakama announced that he would no longer urge
citizens to contest the election results but to stay calm.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican capital Maputo hosted the two-day CPLP summit from
July 17 to 18, which was attended by six heads of state of the
group, which includes Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau,
Mozambique, Portugal and Sao Tome and Principe.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Egypt Share Special Responsibilities in Addressing Challenges: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amre Moussa said Wednesday that South Africa and Egypt
shoulder special responsibilities in addressing the challenges
facing Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We believe we have special responsibilities to maintain and
promote peace, development and security in Africa," Moussa said at
the fourth session of the South Africa-Egypt bilateral commission
held in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said that it did not mean the two
countries were the only ones with that responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Politically and economically, Africa was "not in good shape",
said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"That is an understatement. The social situation is
catastrophic. The health situation is very, very serious," Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-
Zuma, the challenges of security, development and unity facing
Africa will top the agenda of the South Africa-Egypt bilateral
commission.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers are scheduled to sign a number of
agreements at the end of the session on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Hails Brazilian Active Participation in CPLP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres hailed the Brazilian leadership of the Community of
Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP), saying that it is "a
qualitative leap of great significance" for the seven-nation
organization, according to reports reaching here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Guterres, addressing a press conference on Tuesday after the
two-day CPLP summit in Maputo, said Brazil's new role, embodied by
the newly-elected executive secretary of CPLP Dulce Pereira, will
give the CPLP broader international presence and influence,
without diminishing Lisbon's participation.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a new commitment and potential for "The Seven
" to maintain regular diplomatic consultations on international
issues and work together at the United Nations and other world
forums.
</P>
<P>
While Brazil has functioned "at half-speed" during the past
four years since the foundation of the organization in 1996, it "
is now fully involved", Guterres added.
</P>
<P>
The summit unanimously chose Dulce Pereira, an official of the
Brazilian Culture Ministry, as its new executive secretary and set
its next summit for Brazil in 2002. The CPLP, whose member
countries span three continents, also emerged strengthened from
the summit through decisions to create CPLP institutions in all
the member states, Guterres stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Popular events", such as sports competitions, he added, would
be organized to make the community closer to the 200 million
Portuguese-speakers around the world.

HARARE, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
Wednesday urged African countries to do their utmost to fight
poverty on the continent.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency, Ebrahim
Samba, WHO Regional Director of the Regional Office for Africa,
said he had asked leaders of African states to carry the burden of
poverty reduction on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
Samba was attending a three-day regional consultation workshop
in Harare being held for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The regional consultation was aimed at asking the governments
and other interested parts to make health an essential component
of their national policies targeting poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Samba said the traditional practice of passing responsibility
of health to donors had no fruitful results for the continent,
noting that "donors would help us but they have interests of their
own".

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Wants Social Intervention in Combating AIDS: Minister  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa sees social
intervention as an important weapon in the fight against AIDS,
Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Social interventions -- the mainstay of primary prevention
efforts -- remain the most potent weapon in our fight against this
scourge," said the minister, adding that the temptation to see HIV/
AIDS in only a medical context should be resisted.
</P>
<P>
"This is not... meant to disregard the importance of medical
intervention in improving the quality of life of those with this
disease, but rather an appeal for us not to lose sight of the fact
that this is essentially a social disease," she said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tshabalala-Msimang reaffirmed President Thabo Mbeki'
s assertion that any response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, to be
comprehensive and sustainable, had to be located within the
reality of the prevailing twin scourges of poverty and disease.
</P>
<P>
"The battle against HIV and AIDS has to be won, and therefore
will be fought tenaciously on all fronts that employ affordable,
effective and sustainable strategies.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard prevention remains our vanguard, while we
continue to work tirelessly to investigate other options and
interventions," she said.
</P>
<P>
As far as South Africa's health status, socio-economic
situation and level of infrastructure development are concerned,
no other weapon would in the long term achieve the benefits that
prevention would, she said.
</P>
<P>
As to the 13th international AIDS conference held in Durban,
Tshabalala-Msimang said the conference was a success and had met
the goals of the government.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous conferences, which were held in the developed
countries and focused on the challenges of the developed world,
this one had a strong African character.
</P>
<P>
Among the features of the conference was "the focus on the
unacceptability of the continued marginalization of those from
developing countries with respect to access to drugs", the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Leaves for Japan to Address G8 Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki left the country on Wednesday for Japan to pinpoint African
problems at the G8 summit in Tokyo on July 21, the Presidential
Office said.
</P>
<P>
The president is among a delegation of leaders from various
organizations of the developing countries. Other members of the
delegation include Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Thailand's Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
The mandate to represent the interests of Africa was given to
President Mbeki and to President Bouteflika of Algeria by the
Extraordinary Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
held in Sirte in Libya in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will press forward the need for developed
countries to seriously address issues of concern to the developing
countries, primarily efforts to ensure people-centered development
and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Within the context of globalization, the G8 Summit is seen as an
important organization for convincing wealthy countries of the
need to enter into partnerships for the development of the
developing countries, especially Africa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which involves this delegation of the developing
countries and the G8 leaders will be the first of its kind.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Alleviates Public Fears on Accounts of Looted Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- In response to public fears that the
accounts containing alleged loots from public funds by former
Nigerian head of state Sani Abacha might have been moved away or
misused, the Nigerian government Tuesday clarified that they were
still kept "intact".
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Wednesday quoted Minister of State for Finance
Jubril Kuye as saying in Abuja that some 1.82 billion U.S. dollars
of suspected funds had been frozen in a number of banks abroad and
proceedings for recovery had been initiated.
</P>
<P>
Recovering money looted by former corruptive officials is a key
aspect of President Olusegun Obasanjo's high profile anti-
corruption crusade, Kuye said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister noted that the work has proved to be very
difficult, because substantial evidence, which is hard to obtain
in most cases, must be filed to the courts before the money could
be got back.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has asked some European countries to
provide legal assistance for this purpose.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Minister Urges EU to Lift Ban on Fish Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Public Health Minister Sam
Ongeri has urged the European Union (EU) to lift the ban on Kenya'
s fish exportation as the country's fish industry has met the
hygienic standards required.
</P>
<P>
When meeting a European Parliament delegation here on Tuesday,
Ongeri said his ministry has put in place measures to ensure that
fish processing is done in accordance with international standards,
media here reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Public health officials have been ordered to conduct routine
checks to ensure that fish processing is done in high hygienic
standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
The export of fresh fish from Kenya to the EU was banned in
January 1998 on the grounds of poor hygienic conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to Ongeri, the ban has led to heavy losses and
increased poverty levels. The ban is causing Kenya a loss of 5
billion shillings (about 65 million U.S. dollars) annually, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ulla Sandeback, one of the delegation members, told Ongeri that
they would raise the matter with the European Commission and the
European Council of Ministers.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Fish Ban on Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has lifted its
ban on Uganda's fish exports, the New Vision daily reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Fisheries Minister Fred Mukisa was quoted as saying
that he had got a parcel from Brussels that the ban on Uganda fish
was lifted on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the minister said he is yet to receive an official
declaration although he is sure of his sources.
</P>
<P>
"They (EU) are likely to send the official statement in two or
three weeks' time after which we shall send them a list of our
approved processing plants and start exporting on bilateral terms,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral status means that Uganda will export fish to EU
countries with which it has independent arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The ban, which affected the whole East African region due to
massive fish poisoning in Lake Victoria, took effect in Uganda on
April 14, 1999 and has since cost the country 30 million U.S.
dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- A dramatic rise in violent crime
was revealed in the government's latest figures, while overall
crime has risen by nearly four percent, the BBC reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Home Office figures for England and Wales showed a total of 5.3
million offenses reported to the police in 1999-2000 compared to 5.
1 million in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw stressed that Labour was determined
to be tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
"We came into government with a promise to be tough on crime
and tough on the causes of crime, this is not an empty slogan at
all," he told BBC.
</P>
<P>
But the Conservatives strongly criticized the government over
the new figures, blaming them on falling police numbers.
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging that there were serious problems with
the number of violent crimes and robberies, Straw said police
targeting of car crime and burglaries had seen both drop.
</P>
<P>
Promising to bear down on crime caused by drunken behavior,
Straw said: "There is a really serious problem about alcohol and
violence.
</P>
<P>
Straw also called on police forces around the country to follow
the example of those forces where crime had actually fallen over
the last year, without the use of additional resources.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Lower On Profit-Taking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock ended lower
Tuesday as investors took some profits from a rally in the
previous sessions after the release of the June Consumer Price
Index report.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 64.35 at 10,739.92.
The blue chip index fell 8.48 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 97.50 at 4,177.17 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 16.75 at 1,493.74.
</P>
<P>
The market fell as investors cashed in profits from the gains
in the industrial and technology sectors after the Labor
Department released the CPI report in June. The report said the
overall CPI jumped a higher-than-expected 0.6 percent in June but
the code CPI, which excludes the volatile energy and food
categories, rose just 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that inflation remains tame but the new
data failed to clear up uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's
next move on interest rates although Wall Street analysts expected
the central bank to leave the rates unchanged at the August 22
meeting. The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times in the
past 13 months and the rate hikes were slowing the U.S. economy
and inflation remains under control.
</P>
<P>
Because of the profit-taking by investors, chipmaker Intel,
software giant Microsoft and Apple Computer fell ahead of their
earnings report release later today, driving the whole market
lower.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 4.99 at 658.21 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 8.90 at 536.28. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 0.09 at 943.75.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Earnings Beat Analyst Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft reported Tuesday its
fourth-quarter earnings of 5.76 billion U.S. dollars, beating
analyst expectations by 2 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of analysts expected the software giant to earn
42 cents per share on revenue of 5.6 billion dollars for the
quarter. Analysts predicted that the company's unusually high
sales reported one year ago would be hard to top. They have been
also closely watching the sales of Windows 2000 operating system
which was launched in February because it is a key indicator of
the health of not only Microsoft, but the PC industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based company reported 22.92 billion dollars for
the entire fiscal year that ended June 30, up 16 percent from
revenue of the previous year. Net income for the year totaled 9.42
billion dollars, compared with 7.79 billion dollars for the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Strong corporate sales of its Windows 2000 operating system
drove fourth-quarter earnings, the company said.
</P>
<P>
"We experienced another record year of business results despite
many challenges," Microsoft said in a statement, pointing to
growth in Asia and its consumer business. "Although we remain
guarded in the near term about business PC growth rates, we look
forward to the tremendous opportunity in front of us with the
Windows 2000 generation of server products."
</P>
<P>
The company reiterated its claim to have seized the traffic
lead for Internet properties. The MSN network recorded 19 percent
year-over-year growth in U.S. audience reach. The company's ISP,
MSN Internet Access, now has 3 million members, a 20 percent
improvement from a year ago, the company said.

WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of Representatives
voted 281-147 Tuesday to reject a resolution challenging President
Clinton's decision to extend normal trade relations with China for
another year.
</P>
<P>
The House debated and voted on the resolution because the
Senate has yet to take up a bill the House passed last May
granting permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative Bill Archer, the House Ways and Means
Committee chairman, said that he was disappointed that the House
had to vote on the issue after it approved the bill to grant PNTR
status to China.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 237-197 in May to approve the bill granting
PNTR status to China so that the annual debates on normal trade
relations with the country could come to an end.

<P>
Despite a strong support for the bill in the Senate, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott has refused to schedule a vote on the
bill in July.
</P>
<P>
Lott said that before getting to a debate on the PNTR bill, the
Senate must pass several key spending bills and a bill framed by
Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson, which would trigger sanctions
against China if weapons proliferation was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill on PNTR with China have expressed their
concerns that the bill could fall prey to election year politics
if it is not passed this month.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Making Efforts to Reduce Impact of Spilt Crude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian government is making
effort to reduce the environmental impact of 4 million liters of
oil spillage, occurred last Sunday in Parana state.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that the oil company has already
briefed heads of embassies of Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay in
Brasilia the government's determination to this regard.
</P>
<P>
"Brazilian authorities are making every effort to bring down
the accident's impact on national land and avoid that spilt crude
goes beyond national borders", affirmed Brazil's Foreign Ministry'
s item.
</P>
<P>
In the document, Brazil's government commits itself to send to
authorities of the 3 neighboring countries all technical data
relative to the spillage, besides keeping them well informed about
measures taken to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Refinery Getulio Vargas Refinery's oil spillage is considered
the greatest ecological disaster in Parana state. Stains of
spilled crude are moving forward at a speed of 500 to 800 meters
an hour in Iguazu river, which crosses Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of workers dug runoff channels and strung barriers
across the Iguacu River on Tuesday in a race to contain the
country's worst oil spill in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon Tuesday, the black stain had moved about 40
kilometers downstream from the Getulio Vargas oil refinery in
Araucaria, where a burst pipe on Sunday spewed more than 1 million
gallons ( 33,000 barrels) of crude oil into a tributary of the
Iguacu in southern Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said their goal was to keep the spill from
reaching Uniao da Vitoria, about 200 kilometers below the slow-
moving slick. The city of 70,000 people depends on the Iguacu for
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The oil was advancing at about 1 kilometer per hour, and there
was little chance it would reach postcard-famous Iguacu Falls,
650 kilometers away near Brazil's western border with Paraguay and
Argentina, environmentalists said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
have reached an agreement to settle a telecommunications trade row,
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement ... was reached as part of the Enhanced
Initiative on Deregulation," Barshefsky said in a telephone press
conference.
</P>
<P>
"This deal opens Japan's telecommunications market to genuine
competition and should save telecommunications carriers around the
world more than two billion dollars over the next two years," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the agreement, President Bill Clinton said that "this
important agreement will help further reduce regulatory barriers
to trade between the United States and Japan."
</P>
<P>
"It is a win-win for the United States and Japan and represents
an important step as we prepare to discuss the impact of
information technology on the global economy at the (Group of
Eight) summit," Clinton said in a statement read by Barshefsky at
the press conference.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan were scrambling to stop a row over
the interconnection fees charged by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Corp. that had been overshadowing this week's Group of Eight

<HEADLINE> No UK Trial for IRA Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Roisin McAliskey, an Irish
Republican Army suspect, will not face trial in Britain in
connection with a bombing of British army barracks, it was
announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was not enough
evidence to justify trying Ms McAliskey, 26, over the attack on
the barracks in Osnabruck, Germany, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
There were also fears that it had been too long since the
alleged offense for a trial to take place, under British law.
</P>
<P>
The decision, endorsed by the Attorney General and Solicitor
General, was revealed to Parliament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ms McAliskey, daughter of former MP Bernadette McAliskey, is
still wanted for questioning by German police over the attack,
which damaged several buildings.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw caused a political storm two years
ago when he ruled she was too ill to be extradited.
</P>
<P>
Ms McAliskey had been pregnant when she was arrested and was
diagnosed with post-natal depression during the extradition
process.
</P>
<P>
But she could still have been prosecuted in the UK under the
terms of a European counter-terrorism agreement.

<HEADLINE> Intense Talks Continue in Camp David as Clock Ticks Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Intense negotiations between
Israelis and Palestinians continued at Camp David in search of an
agreement on final status issues as clock ticks down on a make-or-
break day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The pace has picked up over the last few days, there are
intense negotiations going on now," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As if there was a crisis in the talks, the spokesman said:"I
wouldn't use that phrase."
</P>
<P>
"There are obviously very difficult issues in front of them but
the parties are continuing to work at them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said President Bill Clinton still planned to leave for
Japan Wednesday morning for a summit of industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Palestinian sources in touch with their
delegation at Camp David said that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat had been about to call U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
report the failure of the three-summit when he was invited to a
last-ditch meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It was also widely reported earlier that the talks at Camp
David had actually come to an impasse over the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. hosts expect that the Israelis and Palestinians can
strike a deal to settle their 52-year conflict before Clinton's
departure for Japan Wednesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Declares State of Emergency in Northern Part of Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 19 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
Wednesday declared a "state of emergency" in northern part of the
country where government troops have been battling dissident
forces for more than a week, according to the Pan-African News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a broadcasting speech that the state of
emergency, declared in consultation with the parliament, will
cover areas in northern Lofa County within the conflict zone.
</P>
<P>
Over a week ago, the government announced that dissident forces
had entered the country from Guinea and attacked the key
provincial town of Voinjama, some 220 kilometers from Liberia's
capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said in the speech in Moronvia: "Fellow Liberians, I
will not deceive you, enemy forces continue to occupy Voinjama and
a few towns around the city and fighting is still going on."
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed that he has ordered all able-bodied men
and women with combat experience to report to various regional
bases in an on-going mobilization exercise and pledged that "not
one inch of Liberian soil will be occupied by anyone in an
unfriendly posture."
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the invading forces have "constant supplies coming
out of Guinea" so it was important that Guinean President Lansana
Conteh "acts urgently in helping to resolve this matter."
</P>
<P>
He cited that the attack was the third on Liberia from Guinea "
most probably with the acquiescence of that government...three
strikes, I think that is enough."
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Liberia has launched formal complaints to the
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, explaining the three
attacks from Guinea on Liberian territory.
