<HEADLINE> Commentary: Confrontation on Human Rights Leads to Nowhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China foiled the United States'
anti-China attempt Tuesday when a "no-action motion" was adopted
at the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights, its ninth victory since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Now the question is: What is the real U.S. intention behind its
repeated attempts against China and other developing countries at
the U.N. human rights sessions?
</P>
<P>
Always posing as a "human rights judge" and concocting
resolutions now and then, the United States wants to seek nothing
but hegemony, interference in other countries' internal affairs,
and imposition of its values, including its human rights views,
upon others -- all in the excuse of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who would not be ordered about by the United States will
be subjected to Washington's punishment, threat of force, or even
the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Brandishing the club of human rights before China, the United
States hates to see a China with political stability, rapid
economic growth and a determination to follow its own path of
development. Therefore, it has used the issue of human rights in
various ways to defame China, make troubles and interfere in its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
It is a well-known fact that China has consistently respected
universal principles of human rights, dedicating itself to
actively advocating and safeguarding the Chinese people's human
rights and fundamental freedoms. Through long unremitting efforts
by the government, China has achieved remarkable progress in this
regard with its people enjoying more rights and freedoms than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
However, turning a blind eye to this, the United States always
seeks confrontation with China on this issue -- out of nothing but
malice. Besides, with its world-recognized poor performance in
human rights, the United States is not in the position at all to
be a human rights judge for others in this regard.
</P>
<P>
China has been pursuing all along the policy of dialogue and
cooperation on human rights, rejecting any attempt to use the
issue for confrontation. Its just and reasonable stance has won
profound understanding and extensive support across the world.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some Western countries have chosen not to be
part of the U.S.-orchestrated anti-China attempts as in the past.
Some European Union countries boycotted the anti-China resolution
at the U.N. human rights session in 1997. And thereafter there has
been no EU involvement in any anti-China attempts at the UN Human
Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
The United States will hold its presidential elections this
year. Behind its move to produce the anti-China resolution in
Geneva once again despite its past failures is domestic politics
and political strife between political parties.
</P>
<P>
Changing its strategy, this year Washington used the Falun Gong
cult, an evil organization hated and disdained by Chinese people,
as its weapon of attack. The U.S. has really gone too far to link
the human rights issue with an evil cult which could not be
tolerated by any country. The real intention of the U.S. in doing
so is to interfere in China's internal affair under the pretext of
human rights and turn the U.N. commission meeting room into a
dirty place where American politicians canvass votes for domestic
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The failures of the U.S. in confrontation with China on the
human rights issue clearly indicate that confrontation will
certainly lead to nowhere and it is a healthy trend to seek
dialogue instead of confrontation on the issue. It shows once
again that the U.S. is acting against the current of times.
Naturally, Washington's arbitrary deeds were under fire from
delegates of developing countries to the session. Many delegates
expressed full support for China's stance and blamed the anti-
China resolution as anachronistic. They also criticized the U.S.
for double standard on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, we advise the U.S. to go with the
trend of the times, give up its Cold War mentality, shift to
dialogue and cooperation and do something that can really promote
the human rights cause. Otherwise, it will not only suffer more
embarrassments, but will also be opposed by all justice-upholding
countries and peoples in the world.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Victory of Justice -- China Foils U.S. Anti-China Attempt Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The rollcall at the 53 members of
the United Nations Human Rights Commission for once seemed to last
forever, turning the voting process into a contest as heated as
any sports contest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Official delegates to the annual commission session, observers,
representatives of non-governmental organizations and members of
the mass media chalked down and calculated fervently the votes on
scoresheets in front of them.
</P>
<P>
Though a hush befell upon the human rights commission hall
where the secretariat rollcalled the members to cast their votes
on China's "no-action motion" regarding the United States draft
resolution, cheers and sighs rang out from time to time as the
votes in favor of China rallied from behind to surpass the votes
supporting the Americans.
</P>
<P>
When the president of the commission pronounced the final
result, the contest ended with China garnering 22 votes against 18
to the United States with 12 abstentions and one absentee.
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth defeat sustained by the United States-led
western bloc since 1990.
</P>
<P>
There was no draft resolution tabled by the United States or
other countries in 1991 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Though the United States boasted full confidence in voting down
China's "no-action motion" just prior to the voting, the ballot
went to the Chinese side when not more than one third of the
voting process was finished.
</P>
<P>
Sides were taken naturally on occasions like this and the side-
taking was so obvious when most of the developing countries on the
commission supported China on grounds that the U.S. practice of
confronting China on the issue of human rights was simply not the
right way to deal with it. All the developed countries sided with
the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Russia said prior to the ballot that the United States only
tried to politicize the issue of human rights and it pointed out
that political confrontation would lead to nowhere but counter-
reaction.
</P>
<P>
Cuba criticized the United States for its double standards on
dealing with the human rights issue of other nations and its own
and supported China's no-action motion by saying that it was right
in accordance with the U.N. laws of procedure and the motion has
been used time and again by the United States itself and other
western countries in the past.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan regretted the fact that the annual U.N. forum was used
by the politically selective United States as a platform for
political combat.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan said that China has made much progress in protecting
and promoting the economic and social rights of its people that
should have been witnessed by all.
</P>
<P>
With four countries remaining and China leading 20-18, Qatar
added one more supportive vote to China, followed by the
abstention of South Korea. Romania was absent when it was called
upon to vote only to leave Russia to seal off the victory for
China in the very end.
</P>
<P>
Applause broke out immediately after Russia's vote in favor of
China and the president of the commission had to caution with his
little hammer the congratulatory applause and announced the
official result for the fully-packed hall to explode once again
into applause of congratulation and celebration.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from developing countries came to shake hands with
the Chinese delegates and offer congratulatory phrases and all
that voted for China burst into hearty smiles as they concluded
the morning session of Tuesday's commission meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It was a victory of justice," said one delegate from the
Pakistani delegation. When the contest was over, a delegate from
Africa echoed resoundingly: "Justice will as always beat off the
evil."

<HEADLINE> Arctic Town Sinking as Result of Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Arctic town of Sachs Harbour
in Canada on the west coast of Banks Island is slowly sinking into
the sea as a result of global warming, the National Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Climate change in the past decade has brought milder winters,
warmer summers and a later freeze-up to soften the permafrost that
supports the Arctic town.
</P>
<P>
Rosemarie Kuptana, an Inuit leader, was quoted as saying the
situation has made it difficult for hunters to travel over an
increasingly muddy landscape.
</P>
<P>
"If this rate of change continues, our lifestyle may forever
change because our communities are sinking with the melting
permafrost," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kuptana is leading an international project to collect Inuit
observations about climate change in her hometown of Sachs Harbour.
</P>
<P>
In the northwest reaches of the Arctic, she said that
experienced hunters have fallen through unusually thin ice. The
region is also seeing the appearance of species such as robins,
barn swallows, beetles and sandflies.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Inuit locals have begun to suffer allergies from
white pine pollen, which has never before reached Banks Island.
</P>
<P>
She urged more attention to the issue of global warming, saying,
"What happens in the Arctic environment is what is in store for
other regions of the world."

</P>

relations ... the strategic partnership between us will allow an
effective bilateral cooperation in political and economic fields,"
Kuchma said.
</P>
<P>
Putin, on the last leg of his three-nation tour which has taken
him to Britain and Belarus, was accompanied by Russia's foreign
and defense ministers and other top officials.
</P>
<P>
He described his talks with Kuchma as pragmatic, adding the two
countries should enhance cooperation in fields of economy,
security, culture and humanitarian aid.

<HEADLINE> China Economy Shows Signs of Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China economy showed signs of an
upturn in the first quarter, and the growth of gross domestic
product (GDP) this year is expected to surpass that of last year,
an official of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
NBS spokesman Liu Chengxiang told a press conference sponsored
by the Information Office of the State Council that four factors
will play an important role in promoting the economic growth,
including active fiscal policy, increasing export, fast
development of high-tech industries, and growing confidence among
both consumers and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
China retained an economic growth rate of 8.1 percent in the
first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that since the economy has shown signs of improvement
because the first quarter figure was even better than the
relatively high growth rate in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In January-March, the country's fixed asset investment surged 8.
5 percent over the first quarter of last year. Meanwhile, exports
jumped 39.1 percent, the consumer price index (CPI) edged up 0.1
percent and retail sales soared 10.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Over the first two months of the year, the index of economic
efficiency of industrial enterprises improved by 15.6 points to 95.
83 points.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that this year's economic growth rate will be a little
higher than in 1999 given that all the fiscal policies are
properly implemented. China registered an economic growth of 7.1
percent last year. However, Liu said that inadequate consumption
demand remains as a major headache for the economy.
</P>
<P>
NBS predicts that the consumer price index (CPI) will break
free from a stand still and grow a moderate pace this year.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, increasing government subsidies for lower-
income groups and prolonged holidays will continue to boost
consumerism. On the other hand, poor investment among non-
government sectors and recovering exports will weigh down
consumption demands.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the Chinese government will continue to implement
active fiscal policies, stimulate demand, accelerate technological
advance and economic restructuring this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech on southeast Asia's economic
development, Goh said southeast Asia is recovering from the
devastation of the regional financial crisis with the resumption
of the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"But there remain major challenges ahead," he said. "The
southeast Asian countries are also having to grapple with the New
Economy even as they seek to turn around their traditional sectors.
"
</P>
<P>
Goh pointed out that politics and economics are intertwined,
and managing contradictory currents towards reform, protectionism
and nationalism will be a major political challenge.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore is preparing for the next phase of the
development and the emergence of the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
The country is making its efforts along four lines, including
deregulating and liberalizing the service sector, deepening and
broadening the capital market, building IT infrastructure, and
fostering a creative and entrepreneurial spirit in the people, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Singapore must move beyond being a "value adding" economy to
become a "value creation" economy to remain relevant and
competitive in the New Economy, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Earning a living is no longer just about reducing costs, or
finding ways to make incremental improvement to an existing
product or process. It is about harnessing the creativity and
innovation of our people to generate wealth through
entrepreneurial endeavors," he said.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the relations between Singapore and the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, Goh said the two should
continue as competitors "because that is a sure sign that we are
both alive and kicking."
</P>
<P>
Singapore has always treated Hong Kong as a benchmark for
enterprise, he said, adding that Singapore companies have invested
far in excess of 50 billion HK dollars (6.4 billion U.S. dollars)
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there will always be a certain amount of competitive
tension between us. But we need also to work together," he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Students Hold Sit-in in Front of U.N. Office in Damascus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian students of
Damascus University held a silent sit-in in front of the United
Nations office here on Wednesday on the occasion of the "
Palestinian Captive Day."
</P>
<P>
The sit-in was called by the Palestinian Student Federation
(PSF) and the Committee on Defense of Palestinian Detainees in
Israeli Jails (CDPD).
</P>
<P>
The protesters handed over two memos, from the PSF and CDPD to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, to the residing representative
of the U.N. Development Program in Damascus Tawfiq Bin Emara.
</P>
<P>
The two memos condemned the "atrocious and inhumane" treatment
practised by the Israeli occupation authorities against Palestinian
detainees.
</P>
<P>
The detainees are subject to various forms of physical and
psychological torture and deprived of medical care, the memos said,
noting that the intimidation was aimed at undermining the religious
and national values of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
Israel holds 3,272 Arabs in its prisons, including 90
administrative detainees and six female prisoners. More than 320
detainees are sick, including 36 cases of blindness and renal
failure that were caused by torture, according to the memos.
</P>
<P>
The protesters urged the United Nations and the international
community to step in immediately to stop the Israeli atrocities and
facilitate the release of the Palestinian detainees according to
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The protesters distributed a statement addressing the
international public opinion on the Israeli inhumane practices
against the Palestinian and Arab detainees.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini PM Ends Visit to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Prime Minister Sheikh
Khalifa Bin Sulman Al-Khalifa left here Wednesday evening after a
two-day official visit to Jordan to promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two countries signed three protocols to
consolidate bilateral cooperation in health, culture and science.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to set up a higher joint committee
which will be co-chaired by the two prime ministers to supervise
the implementation of the agreements already signed between the two
countries as part of the efforts to further enhance bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's talks, Khalifa and Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh reviewed the latest developments in the Middle
East peace process, and said that both countries stand for a just,
durable and comprehensive peace in the region on the basis of the
land-for-peace principle and relevant resolutions by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Khalifa's visit to Jordan is part of the increasing high-level
contacts between the two countries after Jordanian King Abdullah
Bin Hussein and Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa came
to power in February and March 1999, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's ties with the Arab gulf states had been severely
affected by the 1990 Gulf crisis as Amman was believed to side with
Iraq after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah adopts peace and cooperation as the corner stone
of his foreign policies, and is trying to improve Jordan's
relations with the Arab Gulf states while maintaining a friendly

TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Wednesday lashed out at a United Nations
resolution passed recently criticizing the human rights situation
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The politically motivated resolution fell short of reflecting
the realities in Iran's dynamic society, and it is only a
repetition of the allegations already made against the country,
Asefi said.

He condemned the sponsors of the anti-Iran resolution, accusing
them of exploiting political and economic leverages to draw votes
against Tehran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran has an agenda to honor human rights and guarantee the
fundamental freedoms of the people in line with religious beliefs,
the Islamic values and the stipulations of the constitution, Asefi
said.

He added that Iran has reinforced the rule of law, democracy and

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Delivers Speech in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin delivered a speech here on Wednesday on the Sino-Turkish
relations, the international situation, domestic affairs and other
issues at a banquet held in his honour by his Turkish counterpart
Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-Turkish relations, Jiang said the friendship between
the two peoples dates back to ancient times, with the evidence of
the world-known "Silk Road" linking China and the Asia Minor
peninsular more than 2000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Through this ancient road, he added, the forefathers of the two
peoples made extensive exchanges and promoted, together with other
nations, trade and the communication of civilizations of the East
and West.
</P>
<P>
The exquisite porcelain which was made in various dynasties in
ancient China and is now in store in the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul
bear vivid testimony to the lasting friendship between the two
peoples, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also hailed the remarkable achievements made by the
Turkish people, as reflected in continuous social advancement and
rapid economic development, adding Turkey has become a country that
attracts the attention of the world community.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said it is of vital importance for China
and Turkey, located respectively at the east and west ends of the
Asian continent, to develop a new relationship of cooperation and
partnership.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the world affairs, Jiang said there is a general
trend of tension-easing in the international situation, but the
world is far from being tranquil.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that maintaining the world peace and promoting
common development is the theme of the present time and the
universal aspiration of the world people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that on one hand, a lasting international peaceful
environment is necessary for China, which is now pursuing reforms
and opening up to the outside world and pushing forward the
modernization drive, on the other hand, the world peace and
development also necessitate the stability and development in
China.
</P>
<P>
China, which follows the foreign policy of peace and
independence, is a major force in maintaining the world peace and
stability, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
On domestic affairs, Jiang said the 56 nationalities in China
have forged solid links in which they learn from each other, depend
on each other, help each other and promote the benefits of each
other.
</P>
<P>
Since the ancient times, Jiang said, the different nationalities
in China, who have displayed an immense cohesion and a longstanding
tradition of patriotism, have been of one heart in founding and
building their country.
</P>
<P>
He said the cultures and traditions of minorities have been held
on respect and protection and each minority can keep and develop
its own culture.
</P>
<P>
Recently, he said, China has embarked on a strategic mission of
developing the west region of the country, partly in a bid to
accelerate the economic, social and cultural development in the
minorities areas there.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, where many religions such as Taoism,
Buddhism, Islam and Christianity are in existence, has adopted the
policy of respecting and protecting the freedom of religious
beliefs, followed the principle of separating religion from
political power and education.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that the country protects normal religious
activities and the legitimate rights of religious groups, with the
different religions sharing equal status and in peaceful co-
existence, and religious believers and non-believers respecting
each other and living in unity and harmony.
</P>
<P>
As there are nearly 200 countries and regions, more than 2,500
nationalities as well as many religions in the world, Jiang said,
proper handling of the ethnic and religious issues is of vital
significance to maintaining world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that as the world is colorful, the varieties and
disparities among different nationalities, the religions and the
civilizations should be respected.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with their mutual relations, he said that tolerance,
communication, dialog and co-existence should be advocated while
discrimination, repellence, confrontation and conflicts be opposed.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of mutual respect, equality and the principle of
seeking common ground while reserving differences, the positive
sides of all the civilizations should be given full play to boost
incessant development of the human society and achieve the common
progress of all countries and peoples on earth.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that throughout the ages, the mutual discrimination,
repellence, confrontation and conflicts among the countries and
peoples with different religious beliefs and ethnics, not only
inflict damages and disasters on the related countries and peoples,
but also undermine the stability, tranquility and development in
many regions and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The international community should bear in mind these lessons,
he stressed, saying the overweening arrogance, and the agitation of
national split and hatred among different ethnics go against the
historical trend and harm the lofty cause of peace and development
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also attached importance to adhering to and reinforcing
the common understanding between China and Turkey on safeguarding
each other's sovereignty, territorial integrity and ethnic unity.
</P>
<P>
In the 20th century, both China and Turkey experienced
remarkable changes. Since the founding of the People's Republic of
China and the Republic of Turkey, the two peoples, in line with the
conditions of their own countries, have gone all out and worked
hard to score remarkable achievements, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, China's economy has been growing at an annual
average of 7.7 percent for the past 50 years while Turkey's
comprehensive national strength has ranked the 16th in the world.
</P>
<P>
This, he added, testifies that the peoples of ancient nations
certainly can make continuous progress in their development, so
long as they give active play to their profound cultural
accumulation and tradition of braveness and hard-working, and
absorb the latest achievements in the scientific and cultural
fields.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Turkey Visit a Historic One: Demirel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said here Wednesday that the ongoing visit to Turkey by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin has not only brought the traditional
friendship of the Chinese people to the country, but furthered the
bilateral friendly ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet he hosted in honour of the Chinese
president, Demirel called the visit a "historic" one which will
guarantee the prospect of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is looking forward to pushing the Turkey-China relations
to a new height, Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the joint communique signed between the two countries
earlier in the day as a document to push the bilateral ties to the
level of closer partnership.
</P>
<P>
The communique demonstrated the willingness of the two sides to
consolidate the bilateral relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey hopes that China will join the World Trade Organization
at an earlier date because China's WTO admission will create new
opportunities for the Turkey-China economic cooperation and trade,
the president said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that besides governmental departments, the private
businesses of the two countries will take the opportunity to make
contributions to the balanced development of two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Demirel expressed his appreciation for the great progress China
has made in its economic development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish people hope that China will fulfill the
reunification cause under the guidance of the "One Country, Two
Systems" policy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang arrived here Tuesday for a state visit as the
guest of Demirel. Turkey is the third leg of his five-nation visit,
which had brought him to Israel and Palestine, and will take him to
Greece and South Africa.

SAN JOSE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's Foreign Minister
Roberto Rojas will arrive Friday to Morocco, his first stage of a
nine-day trip to take him to Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of these visits is to "reinforce Costa Rican
interest to re-start the path to establish new friendship and
cooperation links with Arab countries," said the Foreign Ministry
in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The Arab world severed relations with Costa Rica when the
government of the Central American country moved its Israel
embassy to Jerusalem, going against the United Nations resolution.
</P>
<P>
After Morocco, Rojas will travel on April 24, to Qatar, where
he will meet with his counterpart, Al Thani; and on April 26 and
27 he will stay in Bahrein, and, finally will conclude his trip in
Kuwait on April 29.
</P>
<P>
Changes in international conditions, progresses in Middle East
peace negotiations and a continuous approach to Arab countries in
multilateral stages opened the doors to re-establishing relations.
</P>
<P>
Rojas' visit to Middle East takes place after his participation
in the Group of 77 meeting at Havana, which finished last weekend.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Entrepreneurs Support Fujimori's Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The third term of President
Fujimori will guarantee Peru's economic stability, said the 38
principal companies of the country, in a survey presented on
Wednesday by the financial consultary "Maximixe."
</P>
<P>
In this survey, Fujimori got 80 percent of the preferences of
Peruvian entrepreneurs, who consider that the presidential
opponent, Alejandro Toledo, lacks a more solid economic proposal.
</P>
<P>
As for the financial system agents' expectations, the survey
results reveal that there are no fears of social turmoil in case
Fujimori is reelected.
</P>
<P>
According to the consultants, Toledo's image has been affected
by his populist promises ant the changes in his positions.
</P>
<P>
Among Toledo's unpracticable proposals, according with the
survey, are the creation of 400,000 jobs during the first three
months of his term, activating production with a tax reduction and
an increase in public sector's expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori and Toledo will dispute the presidential post in a
second electoral round, scheduled by the second week of June,
because none of them got a majority of votes during the first
round on April 9.

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Atlanta barred
anyone from attempting to remove the boy from the country,
extending the injunction issued last week, Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling, which could be appealed, is considered a

The report quoted the appeals judges as saying that they

infringes upon the congressional power."

Elian was rescued on November 25 last year from a shipwreck
after his mother and 10 others were killed when their boat
capsized in the Atlantic.

NAIROBI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- All religious sects in Rwanda are
to be closed because of their illegal operation, Rwanda News

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean White Farmers Invited to Settle in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean white commercial
farmers have been invited to settle in Mozambican central province
of Manica.
</P>
<P>
Manica provincial governor Felicio Zacarias was quoted by
Wednesday's issue of the independent news sheet "Metical" as
saying that negotiations were almost concluded for 150 Zimbabwean
farmers to settle in Manica.
</P>
<P>
But he said the negotiations to settle Zimbabweans in Manica
have been going on for two years, and are not directly related to
the current seizure of commercial farms by Zimbabwean war
veterans.
</P>
<P>
These farmers, he said, will be granted land in Barue district,
which is sparsely populated, and where there is little potential
for land conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Zacarias believed that up to 500,000 hectares could be
available for commercial farming. But the scheme will start with
much smaller amounts with each of the farmers be granted between
200 and 300 hectares.
</P>
<P>
He thought that perhaps 40 Zimbabwean farmers and their
families could be installed in Barue by the start of the next
agricultural year in September.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of these farmers, whom he regarded as
"perhaps the best on the African continent", had their roots in
Africa for three or four generations. "Some of them speak Shona
better than I do", he joked. Shona is the main African language
spoken in Zimbabwe, and the languages spoken in Manica are closely
related to it.
</P>
<P>
Zacarias said the financial aspects of the move from Zimbabwe
to Mozambique were almost settled, with just some insurance
details outstanding.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Encourages Investment in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said here on Wednesday that his government will eliminate all the
bottlenecks presently hindering investors from starting and
building up their projects.
</P>
<P>
Investment is of great importance to the economy of Uganda,
stressed Museveni when commissioning Didi' Amusement Centre in
Kansanga.
</P>
<P>
The amusement centre, comprising a multiple of children's
entertainment games and joy rides, is a huge investment project by
Ddembe Enterprises and the first of its kind in eastern and
central Africa.
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneurship is the "ignition key" in production because it
starts off the process of production, Museveni said, referring to
entrepreneurship as one of the four factors of production
together with land, labor and capital.
</P>
<P>
The president has paid tribute to Karim Hirji of Ddembe
Enterprises and other entrepreneurs in Uganda for the role they
are playing in the rapid growth of the national economy,
according to a press release from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
Karim Hirji said that his group of companies has been able to
make investment worth more than 100 million U.S. dollars due to
the peace and security prevailing in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1998-99 financial year, the private investment in Uganda
expanded by 13 percent, and this is proof that the private sector
remains very confident about the prospects of the economy, an
analyst said here Wednesday.

<P>
ANKARA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
Speaker Yildirim Akbulut and representatives of parties of the
Turkish Grand National Assembly (parliament) Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he felt very glad to once again meet Akbulut,
who paid a visit to China in March, and conveyed best regards to
him from Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National
Congress Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that the speaker's successful visit
to China, during which both sides friendly and sincerely exchanged
views on Sino-Turkish relations, has increased mutual understanding
and promoted development of friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that during his state visit to Turkey, he saw the
significant achievements which the Turkish people have made in
national development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that during the visit, he informed the Turkish side
of the current situation in China, stressing that the world is rich
and colorful and multiple development models should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Tolerating only one development model is a foolish thinking,
said Jiang, adding that only when various development models are
allowed to thrive can the 21st century become a century of peace,
stability, growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen from a number of Arab
countries will hold the fourth meeting in Kuwait on May 6-7, an
official of the Arab Businessmen Council said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from Egypt, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, the
Palestinian self-rule areas, Sudan and Yemen will take part in the
meeting sponsored by the Kuwaiti-based Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development, said Saeed al Taweel, deputy chairman of the
Arab council and head of the Egyptian Businessmen Association.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen will try to formulate mechanisms for financing
inter-Arab trade in the coming period, al Taweel was quoted as
saying by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Arab fund will finance 500 million U.S. dollars to trade
projects among Arab countries in an effort to enhance the inter-
Arab trade, which stands at less than 20 percent of Arab states'
total foreign trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that representatives of the Islamic Bank for Development
will attend the meeting for the first time to discuss with the
businessmen the bank's role in helping boost trade among the Arab
countries.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Blair Resists Calls to Punish Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Wednesday rejected calls for moves to suspend Zimbabwe's
commonwealth membership over the farm-seizure crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions in the House of Commons about situation in
the former British colony, Blair said people in Zimbabwe were
warning against emotional reaction or interference.
</P>
<P>
"It is best we are guided by those with most to lose, not those
commenting from a safe distance," he told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Stressing it was important that any action Britain took did not
make it worse for the white farmers in Zimbabwe, Blair condemned
the attacks on farms owned by white people, mostly from Britain
originally.
</P>
<P>
"Of course it is a disgraceful situation in Zimbabwe. We
condemn utterly the barbaric attacks on farmers," He said.
</P>
<P>
Blair said Britain was pursuing "every avenue open to us" to
try to stop the attacks, through the Commonwealth, the European
Union and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The government was also in touch with Zimbabwean opposition
leaders and farmers' unions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some parliament members argued that Britain should freeze the
financial assets of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe or agitate
for the Commonwealth to suspend Zimbabwe in the wake of farm
invasions that have seen a policeman and two white farmers killed
there.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges to Strengthen U.N. Ability to Protect Civilians in Armed Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday urged the United Nations security Council
to consider taking further steps towards strengthen the
Organization's ability to protect civilians in armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the open debate of the Security Council on
protection of civilians in armed conflict, Annan once again
recommended that a rapid deployment force be created, which he
thinks as the most far-reaching measure.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in East Timor underscored the importance of having
a more systematic rapid reaction capacity in the United Nations,
Annan told the 15-member Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also recommended the Security Council make use
of preventive deployment when there has been sufficient warning of
impending attacks or an escalation of conflict.
</P>
<P>
"In February of this year, we successfully concluded such a
mission in the Central African Republic," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the Security Council's willingness to consider the
further establishment of preventive missions, including the
dispatch of monitors and fact-finding mission.
</P>
<P>
A critical element in enhancing the protection of civilian in
armed conflict lies in improving the security of camps for
refugees, the U.N. chief stressed.
</P>
<P>
U.N. agencies and others have taken a number of initiatives in
relation to the security, civilian and humanitarian character of
refugees camps and settlements, he said.
</P>
<P>
In future conflict situations, it may be necessary to consider
temporary security zones and safe corridors for the protection of
civilians, Annan noted.
</P>
<P>
"The open debate of the Security Council bears vivid testimony
to a growing recognition that our first duty in any conflict is to
support the innocent civilian -- who have no part in the fighting,
who have nothing to gain from its persistence, and who have no
choice but to rely on the international community to help them in
their most desperate hour of need, " the U.N. chief added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reports 8 Percent Drop in Gasoline Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Gasoline prices have fallen to an
average 66.8 cents (about 0.45 U.S. dollars) a liter in Canada
from their record high at 72.6 cents (about 0.49 U.S. dollars) on
March 21.
</P>
<P>
The 8 percent drop is part of a reversal from a 15-month upward
trend since January of 1999, when the prices were as low as 47.5
cents (about 0.32 U.S. dollars) a liter, the Globe and Mail
newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices have steadily come down after the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to increase production on
March 28.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices have dipped to about 26 U.S. dollars a barrel
from more than 34 dollars in early March.
</P>
<P>
The price alleviation is better than expected than many
analysts, who originally thought that the increased crude oil
production would not turn into noticeable savings at the Canadian
pumps until July or August.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the going-down trend may also be fragile as U.S.
gasoline inventories remain at historic lows, according to the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> China: Protecting Civilians in Armed Conflict Should be Handled on Case-by-Case Basis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19(Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council should review and handle the issue of protection of
civilians in armed conflict on a case-by-case basis, treating each
situation according to its own merits, China stressed here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Security Council's open debate on the protection
of civilians in armed conflict, Chinese Permanent Representative
to the United Nations, Wang Yingfan, said it is necessary for the
Security Council to take timely measures in response to cases like
the Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is the sovereign states that should bear the main
responsibility for protecting civilians in armed conflict. The
Security Council stands no chance in successful reviewing and
handling this issue without the close cooperation of the part of
countries involved," Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
"It should give full respect to the opinions of countries or
parties concerned, provide them with various kinds of assistance
according to their specific needs and take actions, when necessary,
to support their efforts for the protection of civilians," Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, in the country where there exists an armed
conflict, the government is supposed to make decisions on what
measures to be necessary for protecting civilians, in accordance
with the nature and characteristics of the conflict and the actual
situation of civilians in the area of conflict," the Ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, positions of the sovereign states should be
respected by the Security Council. To take action in the absence
of the understanding and cooperation on the part of the countries
involved will possibly lead to resistance and opposition by the
latter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Should this be the case, not only will relevant measures for
protecting civilians fail to be truly implemented, but also more
civilians will be dragged into miserable situations, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"It must also be pointed out that it runs counter to the
purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter and is doomed to have
severe consequences to wantonly interfere in other countries'
internal affairs or even attempt to overturn a legal government
under the pretext of protection of civilians and by politicizing
humanitarian concerns, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi accepted Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema's resignation here
Wednesday evening and will start his consultations to find a
successor tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general at the president's office, Gaetano Gifuni,
said Ciampi expects to finish his consultations by Friday.
</P>
<P>
The next big step in the crisis will be a summit of the center-
left parties scheduled at 6pm local time to pick a candidate to
take over from D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the leader of the Greens party, Grazia Francescato,
said there was a "90 percent chance" of finding a name Wednesday
evening,but her optimism was seen as misplaced by top officials in
other government parties.
</P>
<P>
Arturo Parisi, the leader of the Democrats, second large party
of ruling center- left bloc said finding a name Wednesday evening
was to be hoped for, but "seems difficult."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a letter to D'Alema, Left Democrat Party
Secretary Walter Veltroni voiced similar sentiments, urging him to
re-launch a new center-left project for the "rebirth of the spirit
" that won the general election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He also said all the "center-left ruling class" had to shoulder
responsibility for the regional election defeat on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> UK Government To Tackle Distraction Burglary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 19 (Xinhua) - A package of measures to tackle
distraction burglary, often called 'burglary artifice', was
announced by British Crime Minister Charles Clarke Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plans include a nationwide leaflet drop by the National
Neighborhood Watch Association (NNWA) and the creation of 20 pilot
schemes across England and Wales to help identify ways to tackle
this crime.
</P>
<P>
Distraction burglaries claim over 16000 victims every year in
Britain but the true figure is believed to be much higher because
many people do not report the burglary.
</P>
<P>
Home Office said that one of the reasons for this is often the
sense of shame at having to admit that they trusted someone enough
to let them into their homes without checking identification first.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the plans, Clarke said "This is not a crime that the
Government can tackle alone. Organizations that send out people
for home visits have an enormous role to play and I am very
pleased that many organizations have agreed to support this
campaign."

"The future marine markets are potentially huge and Rolls-Royce is
now perfectly positioned to take advantage of this growing sector.
"
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce acquired Vickers for its Marine Systems Division as
it recognized that the opportunity for similar strong sustainable
growth existed in the marine market.
</P>
<P>
The company has forecast that the marine market is growing at
four percent per annum, with power systems accounting for 15
percent of the market value.

UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The issue of protecting
civilians in armed conflict involves political, peace-keeping,
humanitarian, disarmament, legal and many other dimensions and it
needs the concerted efforts by the whole international community
as well as the United Nations, China stressed here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Security Council's open debate on the
protection of civilians in armed conflict, Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, Wang Yingfan, said in
considering the issue, the Security Council should have a clear
division of work and enhance coordination and cooperation with
other bodies.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the 40 recommendations in the U.N.Secretary-General'
s previous report were not put forward for the Security Council
only, and many of them require the General Assembly, the Economic
and Social Council, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees and other relevant bodies to review and handle.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, all agencies within the U.N. system should have
a clear description and division of work and duty. The Security
Council can review and handle this issue within its own mandate
and by doing so support and cooperate with efforts in this regard
by other relevant agencies," the Ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way that different departments of U.N. can
work in harmony and mutual-enhancement, and the U.N. system as a
whole can play its role more effectively," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19(Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council should, apart from addressing the issue of protection of
civilians in armed conflict at hand, seek to eradicate the causes
of armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Security Council's open debate on protecting
civilians in armed conflict, Chinese Permanent Representative to
the United Nations, Wang Yingfan, said with its primary
responsibility of the maintenance of international peace and
security, the Security Council should draw upon both successes and
failures in the past so as to perform its duties in a more
effective manner, with a view to creating a favorable
international environment of peace for all regions and countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Council should focus its efforts to find solutions of the
armed conflicts. Only by creating an overall favorable and
peaceful environment and defusing at an early date the specific
conflicts and disputes, can the effective protection of civilians
be truly realized,' the Ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we believe that the international community
and relevant U.N. bodies should take further steps to eradicate
the root causes of the conflicts by helping relevant countries to
eliminate poverty, develop economy, promote national
reconciliation and safeguard domestic stability," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Only by these means can a fundamental solution be reached to
the issue of protection of civilians in armed conflict, he added.

<P>
LUANDA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The civil conflicts in Angola and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are making the
humanitarian crisis deteriorating on the African continent, a
high-ranking United Nations refugee official said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The (southern African) region has more refugees than five
years ago. The situation has become more volatile, it has in fact
deteriorated," said Nicholas Bwakira, director for the southern
African region of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is now home to 400,000 refugees fleeing conflicts in
Angola and the DRC, while Namibia is sheltering 10,000 Angolan
refugees, said Bwakira.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. plans to add 60 million U.S. dollars in aid to 250
million U.S. dollars already pledged by international donors this
year to help refugees in Angola.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, Africa is home to 3.3 million refugees and 15
million internally displaced people, according to the official,
who said that the U. N. refugee agency spent up to 300 million
U.S. dollars a year on refugees in Africa, and that this figure
could rise unless Africa reined in conflicts.

</P>
<P>
"It is time for international community to act in order to

NAIROBI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Conference of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
decided here on Wednesday to accord protection to some of the
world's lesser-known species like coelacanth.
</P>
<P>
Coelacanth, a "living fossil" fish and once thought to have
become extinct with the dinosaurs, was put into Appendix I of the
convention, which bans any trade in the species.
</P>
<P>
The 150-nation conference also agreed to ban trade in
Australia's dugongs, a type of sea cow, and strengthen
conservation measures for Asian box turtles and African spurred
tortoises, which are caught wild and sold into the global pet
trade.
</P>
<P>
But proposals for a total ban on trade in species of musk deer
and Black Sea bottlenose dolphins were rejected.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day conference due to end on Thursday earlier this week
upheld long-standing bans on trade in ivory, whales and marine
turtles, but refused to protect great white sharks, whale sharks
and basking sharks.
</P>
<P>
The convention already provides varying levels of protection to
more than 30,000 plant and animal species and the number keeps
increasing.

Zimbabwe is a historical problem that has to be resolved, which
will possibly require the United Kingdom to honor an undertaking
to make funds available for land reform in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, asked at a joint news conference held by South
African Public Enterprises Minister Jeff Radebe and Mozambican
Finance and Planning Minister Luica Diogo whether the two
ministers had discussed Zimbabwe's turmoil during the meeting,
Radebe said: "Not at all. It was a meeting between South Africa
and Mozambique. Only bilateral issues were discussed."
</P>
<P>
"I can't express any view (on Zimbabwe) right now. The
statements that were made by our president speak for themselves,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> SADC Not to Intervene in Zimbabwe's Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) will not intervene in Zimbabwe's
internal affairs or publicly pressurize President Robert Mugabe,
Mozambican and South African presidential spokesmen said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association, a spokesman for
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, who chairs the SADC, said
in a telephone interview: "At the moment it is our belief that
the Zimbabweans can resolve their own problems."
</P>
<P>
Things has not got out of hand in Zimbabwe and the SADC's
priorities are the civil wars in Angola and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, the spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
There is no need for a special SADC mission to Zimbabwe as the
SADC heads of state are in routine telephone contact with Mugabe
and each other and Chissano's view is that the instability in
Zimbabwe can be stopped if the genuine desire of its people for
land can be resolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South African President Thabo Mbeki has so far
resisted pressure to publicly condemn the illegal occupation of
white-owned farms in Zimbabwe by Mugabe's supporters and war
veterans, the presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would neither confirm nor deny media reports
that Mbeki is leading a secret regional initiative to resolve the
crisis in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
A state visit by Mbeki to Zimbabwe is on the cards, but the
date has not been decided yet, Mankahlana said.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Draft Peace Deal to Be Ready by June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The draft proposals for
Burundi peace deal may be ready by June, a member of the
facilitation team for Burundi peace talks hinted on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha, the chairman of the Democracy and Good Governance
Committee for the peace talks Nicholas Hayssom said the
facilitation team will meet early next month in Arusha to prepare
the draft proposals, which will later be given to the 19 concerned
parties at the talks for response.
</P>
<P>
Since the negotiations are now more focused than ever, said
Hayssom, a professor from South Africa, "I'm optimistic that a
peace deal is possible." "Holding meetings and listening have made
us understand better the issues," the chairman noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the committee he heads has not achieved a
breakthrough on contentious issues like the electoral system and
the transitional instruments.
</P>
<P>
He has asked the delegates to present by the end of this month
their written suggestions that will be the basis for the
facilitation team to draw proposals.
</P>
<P>
Around 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have lost their
lives since the outbreak of war in the tiny central African
country in 1993 between Hutu rebels and the army, dominated by the
minority Tutsi ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, which began in Arusha in June 1998, are
currently taking place in four committees, dealing respectively
with the nature of the Burundi conflict, democracy and good
governance, peace and security for all and economic reconstruction
and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen Burundian parties, including two deposed presidents,
are attending the talks, currently under the mediation of former
South African president Nelson Mandela.

a very high death toll."
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the first phase of the relief
operation aims at stabilizing the critical situation and stemming
malnutrition by providing the whole population of four affected
districts in Gode zone with regular and carefully balanced
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ICRC said it has begun stockpiling items such as
shelter and other emergency items which could be quickly needed if

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Parliamentary Forum of
the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) on Wednesday
urged the Organization of African Unity (OAU) not to take any
further decisions on a proposed Pan African Parliament until all
African parliaments have been consulted.
</P>
<P>
Forum chairwoman, South African National Assembly Speaker Frene
Ginwala, said a survey of African countries had shown that most of
their parliaments were not consulted on the issue.
</P>
<P>
She told a meeting of the forum's plenary in Cape Town that a
meeting, however, was underway at OAU headquarters in Addis Ababa
to establish a draft protocol for a Pan African Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The forum had thus written to the OAU, asking it not to
finalize the matter until it had heard from all African
parliaments, Ginwala said.
</P>
<P>
Just before the forum adjourned on Wednesday afternoon, Ginwala
informed the 14 SADC countries' delegations attending the meeting
that a response was awaited from the OAU, which would be
circulated among SADC member states.
</P>
<P>
A Malawian delegate said that depending on the reply, a debate
could be held at the next forum meeting later this year, according
to the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The proposal on establishing the Pan African Parliament was
raised at an OAU meeting last year.

COLOMBO, April 19 (Xinhua) - A Sri Lankan senior minister was
authorized to deputize for President Chandrika Kumaratunga while
she is away from the country for a "regular medical check-up," the
President's Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that Kumaratunga had authorized
Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, minister of public administration, home
affairs and plantation industries, to chair cabinet meetings until
her return.
</P>
<P>
"She has also requested Hon Ratnasiri Wickremanayake to
supervise the work of the President's Office in her absence," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It did not say where Kumaratunga had gone or when she would
return.
</P>
<P>
However, newspapers here said that Kumaratunga left on April 11
for Europe and the United States to undergo treatment for wounds
suffered during an attempt on her life late last year.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who is also minister of defense, suffered injuries
to her right eye when a suicide bomber blew herself up at an
election rally in Colombo on December 18 last year. The president
has visited physicians in London and was reportedly advised to
return for additional treatments.
</P>
<P>
The attack has been blamed on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil

above average rain and snow in the region for the past two weeks,
Canada's National Post newspaper reported Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Protests EU's Decision to Tighten Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia on Wednesday lodged
its "strongest protest" against a decision made earlier by leaders
of the European Union (EU) to tighten its current financial
sanctions against the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Slamming the decision as "unilateral and illegal," the Yugoslav
Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it will pose a serious
threat to the life of the country's poor, and is completely in
violation of international law and the EU's established policies.
</P>
<P>
At an informal summit on March 24 in Lisbon, Portugal, the
leaders of the 15 EU nations agreed to keep up political and
economic pressure on Yugoslavia, including tightening financial
sanctions, despite their endorsement of a six-month suspension of
a commercial flight ban on the country.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's Foreign Ministry said the move is designed to
support certain international forces in creating ongoing
disturbances in the Balkans and impeding the integration process
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia hopes the EU will come to know the harm of its
present policies, and will remove immediately all the sanctions
and other restrictions hindering the normal development of
bilateral relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro, has been under
strict sanctions imposed by the United States and the EU since
1992 because of its involvement in the Bosnian War.
</P>
<P>
After the war NATO launched in Kosovo last year, the U.S. and
the EU imposed a ban on air links with the country and stepped up
financial restrictions. The air embargo was lifted late last month
for a period of six months with the possibility of lifting it
permanently in the future.

<P>
ROME, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema has resigned following heavy losses of his center-left
coalition in Sunday's regional elections.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema's resignation was accepted Wednesday evening by
President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Now Italy will either form a new centre-left government or face
early general elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, D'Alema admitted in the Senate that Sunday's
defeat was a blow both for himself and his government. It was
clear that his government has lost a vote of confidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, D'Alema said, Sunday's vote was in no way one against
the current legislature and therefore the legislature should
continue to work to push forward a referendum scheduled for May 21
which is aimed at reforming the electoral law.
</P>
<P>
There are only eleven months left for the mandate of the
current legislature, D'Alema said. Time should be used to
consolidate economic and social reforms and to draft a new
electoral law.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema promised that he will remain at the service of the
center-left government in whatever capacity and that he will be
personally involved in the campaign for next month's referendum.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema tendered his resignation to Ciampi on Monday but the
resignation was rejected.

Hong Kong's total governmental purchase value in 1999
represented an increase of 35.2 percent over the 1998 figure,
mainly due to a greater number of goods and service items
purchased, Director of Government Supplies Nigel Shipman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The product of the highest purchase value was computer
equipment and software at 2.5 billion HK dollars (320 million U.S.
dollars), accounting for 38 percent of the total, he said. Other
high value products include pharmaceuticals, aircraft and spares,
hospital and medical equipment and telecommunications equipment
and spares.
</P>
<P>
"We bought the computer equipment and software for use by
schools and by various government departments," he explained. "
This was roughly double the 1998 figure."
</P>
<P>
The 1999 purchase statistics released Wednesday by the
department showed that contracts at a total value of 6.79 billion
HK dollars ( 870 million U.S. dollars) were awarded for the
purchases of goods and related services in 1999 on behalf of over
80 government departments and some non-government organizations
including the Hospital Authority.

<HEADLINE> HK Computer Hacker Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A computer hacker was sentenced
to six-month in prison at Eastern Magistracy in Hong Kong, while
other two were sent to a detention center, according to the
Commercial Crime Bureau's Computer Crime Section.
</P>
<P>
Police scored its biggest victory yet against computer crime
with the conviction of three "professional" hackers on April 5.
They admitted to the charges and were released on bail pending an
appeal on their sentences.
</P>
<P>
The case was the first in Hong Kong, and the first offense
charged by the section the Organized and Serious Crime Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Senior Inspector of Police Anthony Fung Wai-keung described the
young hackers as "habitual, skillful and professional."
</P>
<P>
"This was a very serious case involving a couple of hundred
victims over several months. It was the worst case of hacking in
Hong Kong on the magnitude of the high number of victims and
Internet Service Providers (ISP) involved," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
Peter Else, acting chief superintendent of the Commercial Crime
Bureau (CCB), said the case was significant both in terms of the
success of the investigation itself and the sentences imposed.
</P>
<P>
He said a clear message was sent to hackers, both locally and
overseas, that Hong Kong was not a soft target and that the courts
took a serious view of computer and Internet-related crime.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Talks with UAE over Island Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Wednesday called for cordial talks and understanding with the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) to solve their territorial dispute over
three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way for removal of the ongoing misunderstandings
between Iran and the UAE except cordial talks and understanding,"
Khatami told reporters together with his Yemeni counterpart
Abdullah Saleh, who is ending a three-day visit to Iran and leaving
for the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Khatami hoped the UAE would respond to this Iranian "
humanitarian request" for talks, understanding and agreement, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We have had no enmity with the UAE and have always extended
hands of friendship towards our UAE brothers and I hope we will one
day witness how misunderstandings can be removed on the basis of
understanding," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three southern Gulf islands of Abu Mussa, the
Greater and Lesser Tunbs after the British forces withdrew from the
region in 1971. Both Tehran and Abu Dhabi claimed full sovereignty
over the islands.
</P>
<P>
The UAE repeatedly called for international arbitration to solve
the dispute, but Iran insisted that the issue should be settled by
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni president said he discussed the Iran-UAE territorial
dispute with Iranian officials and hoped the question would be
solved amicably.
</P>
<P>
He had contacted UAE President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-
Nahayan before he arrived in Tehran on Monday for a three-day
official visit, during which he held talks with Iranian supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, President Khatami and Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
Khatami reiterated that Iran's principled policy is based on
detente and consolidation and expansion of relations with regional
states.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that if good intention, mutual respect and logic
exist, no problem will remain unsolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that through cooperation and reliance on mutual
interests, "we should move towards consolidating security and
stability in the region and realization of this will benefit all
regional states."
</P>
<P>
He cited Iran's recent release of Iraqi prisoners of war, saying
that based on the policy of detente, the two neighbors are moving
toward solving problems and maintaining stability in relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight year war in the 1980s, which
Khatami said served the "interests of foreigners," and cost about 1
million lives from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Iran is ready to move towards a security pact with
regional neighbors, as part of security arrangements in the area.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally such an accord would be based on non-intervention in
each other's internal affairs, mutual respect and honoring
interests of all regional states," he said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that security in the region should be provided by
regional states, and hope that in the near future, the regional
states would witness establishment of security through cooperation.

<HEADLINE> 13 Lebanese Detainees Released After Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The 13 Lebanese prisoners, who
had been held in Israeli custody for over a decade, were set free
by Israel Wednesday afternoon as a ruling of Israel's Supreme Court
finally cleared the way for the release.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were turned over by Israel to the International
Red Cross Organization, which will in turn return them to their
families, at a crossing point in Israeli-Lebanese border, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross bus carrying them is now heading to the Lebanon
side of the border, where their relatives are waiting for them,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
These Lebanese citizens, who had been held in administrative
detention without a trial as bargaining chips for the return or
information of missing Israeli servicemen in Lebanon, are handed
over by Israeli prison officials to Israeli army at about 5 a.m.
(0200 GMT) Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
They were at a border military base to wait for the Supreme
Court ruling on the last-minute petition against their freedom by
the family of missing Israel Air Force navigator Ron Arad.
</P>
<P>
Before the court, Arad's mother issued an emotional plea to the
judges, urging them to look at a soldier's mother in the eyes and
not to abandon her son, who might still be alive, somewhere in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the justices' panel had not let their sympathy win
over professional legal weighing in the case. They rejected the
appeal, saying it is anyway illegal to keep these Lebanese citizens
as they are not posing threats to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
The court deliver the landmark ruling last Wednesday to order
immediate release of eight Lebanese hostages, which prompted the
prison authority to act to set another five free as the principle
of ruling also applied to those ones.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak promised Tuesday to begin an immediate
legislative process to examine and permit the holding of future
bargaining chips in accordance with the concept in international
law.
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation reportedly would shift the decision on
detention from the courts to the defense minister and keep "illegal
fighters", or guerrillas, by methods other than administrative
detention.
</P>
<P>
However, due to pressure by Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, the
plan to pass the law through a fast track schedule was shelved and
the legislation draft is due to be debated in earlier May, which
will be too late for holding these 13 Lebanese prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two most prominent detainees Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid
and Mustafa Dirani, are expected to be held in Israeli prison for
at least one more month, as the Tel Aviv District Court had set May
8 as the date for next hearing of the government's appeal to extend
their detention.
</P>
<P>
Barak's government had made a special effort to guarantee the
continued detainment in Israel of Dirani and Obeid.
</P>
<P>
Israelis regard the two, who belonged to Lebanese anti-
occupation Hezbollah and Amal militias respectively, as figures
posing great danger to the Jewish state's security.

<HEADLINE> 13 Freed Lebanese Detainees Arrive in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The 13 Lebanese detainees who were
freed by Israel and delivered to the International Red Cross
Organization have arrived in Lebanon Wednesday afternoon, People's
Sound radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Lebanese, imprisoned by Israel for more than a decade
without trial, were held by Israel as bargaining chips for
exchanging the missing Israeli air force navigator Ron Arad,
allegedly held by Lebanese anti-Israel resistance movements.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,500 people of the detainees' relatives and reporters had
gathered at the border station of Kafer Tibeneen since Wednesday
morning for their return.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israeli High Court ruled that it is illegal for
Israel to hold prisoners in the hope of swapping them for missing
soldiers. However, the release was postponed twice.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the court rejected a petition, submitted by Arad's
family, asking for a panel of 13 judges to review the ruling to
release the detainees. The family submitted a petition again late
Tuesday in an effort to bypass the landmark High Court's release
ruling.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: 131 Killed in Philippines' Worst Air Mishap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- All 131 people on board the Air
Philippines Flight 541 were killed when the jet crash-landed
Wednesday morning in Samal Island near Davao City in the southern
Philippines, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Philippine National Disaster Coordinating
Council (NDCC), the Boeing 737-200 with 124 passengers and seven
crew members on board crashed at around 07:20 local time (23:20
GMT, Tuesday) in Mount Caanlangan of Samal Island, some 1,000
kilometers south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
The ill-fated Davao-bound aircraft left Manila at around 05:20
local time (21:20 GMT, Tuesday) and was reported missing at about
07:05 local time (23:05 GMT, Tuesday), said the NDCC.
</P>
<P>
Air and land rescue recovery teams that arrived more than an
hour after the disaster in the rugged highland of the island said
the aircraft was in total wreck while the passengers and crew were
badly mangled.
</P>
<P>
Villagers said they heard two loud explosions as soon as the
aircraft zoomed down across coconut grove in the island some eight
kilometers east of the Davao International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Air Transportation Office Executive Director Rolando Luna
reported that Flight 541 circled Davao International Airport
before crashing into the coconut grove.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, airline officials said the Boeing 737-200 plane was
given its normal maintenance check before taking off and no
abnormalities were found.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical Astronomical Services
Administration said weather conditions at the time of the crash
were good and that there was no problem with visibility.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Etrada expressed sorrow over the
early morning crash and ordered concerned agencies to provide
assistance to relatives of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Secretaries Vicente Rivera of the Department of Transportation
and Communications and Orlando Mercado of the Department of
National Defense went to the crash site to investigate the
accident and oversee search and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said his department will investigate the events that led
to the fatal Air Philippines plane crash before deciding on
whether or not to ground the airline's other planes.
</P>
<P>
The investigators are trying to identify whether the tragedy was
caused by pilot error, mechanical problem, bad weather or a
combination of the three factors.
</P>
<P>
Another theory is the possibility of sabotage, in the wake of
reported threats of terrorists to wage war against the government
by bombing public facilities unless their demands are met.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said one of two flight boxes, which can shed light on
what actually transpired before the crash, has been recovered.
</P>
<P>
The Air Philippines Flight 541 tragedy is the worst air tragedy
in the country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, the Cebu Pacific Flight 387 exploded upon
impact in a mountainous area in the southern Cagayan de Oro City,
killing 104 persons.
</P>
<P>
In December 1999, an Asian Spirit aircraft with 17 persons on
board perished when it crash-landed in Nueva Ecija province in the
northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
With intermittent rains, the slow and painstaking process of
picking pieces of bodies scattered at the impact area is still
going on despite the darkness.
</P>
<P>
Military and privately-owned helicopters took turns in ferrying
the wrapped cadavers from the retrieval site to the command center
at the Davao International Airport.
</P>
<P>
A welfare center to serve the kins of the crash victims of the
ill-fated plane has been established in Davao City.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Air Philippines spokesperson Lea Sison said the
airline will extend assistance to the relatives of those who
perished in the crash.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Vice-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, concurrently
Social Welfare Secretary, will be arriving at Davao City on
Thursday to personally assure that all needed assistance can be
extended to the families of the victims.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Launch Fresh Offensive in North S.Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 19 (Xinhua) - Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels
have launched a fresh offensive against military positions along a
strategic highway in northern Jaffna to mark the fifth anniversary
of what is known as Eelam War III which fell on Wednesday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from their office in London late on
Tuesday, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels said
that fierce fighting had erupted in the Thenmarachchi sector of
the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"Having wiped out several kilometers of the front defense lines
of the Sri Lankan troops in Maser and Soranpattu areas the LTTE
forces are advancing deep into the area," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Many bloody battles have been reported in the past four weeks
since the rebels tried to dislodge government troops from key
positions near the A-9 highway in Jaffna. Hundreds of rebels and
soldiers have been killed or wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The present bout of fighting broke out on April 19, 1995 when
the LTTE pulled out of a truce that lasted just 100 days, and is
known as Eelam War III, or the third stage of the LTTE's campaign
for a homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said Wednesday that 12 government
soldiers were killed and 43 wounded when repulsing the rebel
onslaught on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the rebels also suffered
heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE statement said fighting had started Tuesday afternoon
when the guerrillas launched an "offensive thrust" and was
continuing late into the night.
</P>
<P>
It didn't give details of casualties but said Tamil rebel
combatants have recovered large quantities of weapons and
ammunition left behind by government troops.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman confirmed that heavy clashes continued in
the region Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have engaged each other with artillery and
mortars in a bid to keep control of the strategic A-9 highway that
connects Jaffna with the strategic military complex of Elephant
Pass, a narrow causeway linking the peninsula with the rest of
country.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had vowed to wrest control of Jaffna, some 400
kilometers north of the capital Colombo, which was their
stronghold until the army took it back in 1996.

situation and formulated future strategy for enhancing export
volume, he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Bank Starts Venture Capital Fund in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The collaboration, led by UOB Venture Management (UOBVM), UOB's
wholly owned venture capital fund management subsidiary, marks the
start of a series of venture capital activities that UOB plans to
initiate in China, UOB said.
</P>
<P>
UOB's joint venture partner in Beijing is Beijing Centergate
Technologies (Centek), a listed company that is actively involved
in developing the Beijing Experimental Zone (Zhongguancun) --
touted as the "Silicon Valley of the East."
</P>
<P>
Besides, Crystal Internet Venture Funds, a U.S.-based venture
fund specializing in early-stage internet related investments,
also agreed with UOB and Centek to participate in the management
of the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
UOB said it and its partners will seed-fund a direct investment
vehicle to jointly invest in emerging technology companies in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the funds for investment, however, is expected
to come from privately-owned enterprises and listed companies in
China.
</P>
<P>
UOB Group Deputy Chairman Wee Ee Cheong said he is confident
about the venture capital business potential in China.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that Chinese enterprises will increasingly be
looking at more innovative ways of financing, as is the trend
elsewhere, instead of relying solely on traditional loans," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Quek Cher Teck, managing director of UOBVM, said the bank is
exploring similar arrangements in other major cities in China.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to help technology companies in the country's
various growth industries move toward the higher end of the value-
added spectrum - through the provision of capital, and by
facilitating a multilateral flow of management and technology know-
how," Quek said.

<HEADLINE> NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Leader Refutes EP's Anti-China Resolutions (7) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The anti-China motion tabled by the U.S. was rejected on April
18 at the commission session, thus foiling again the U.S. attempt
to interfere in China's internal affairs through alleged human
rights issue, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts speak louder than words and justice will always prevail.
It is unpopular and will lead to nowhere to create confrontation
by exploiting human rights issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to earnestly warn a small number of people in
EP with ulterior motives not to waste the long-established effort-
costing Sino-European friendly relations of cooperation merely due
to their prejudice and ignorance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that the EP and EU member states could
conscientiously abide by the One-China principle and respect the
basic norms governing the international relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In handling the Taiwan-related issues, he urged relevant sides
to proceed from the overall situation of Sino-European relations
and not to conduct official exchanges or exchanges in official
nature with the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
"Do not undermine China's peaceful reunification and
sovereignty and territorial integrity by rendering any form of
support to the Taiwan separatist forces," he warned.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Tibet, "do not support the separatist
activities of the Dalai group," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the human rights issues, "do insist on dialogue and avoid
confrontation so as to promote Sino-European relations without
disturbance," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Leader Refutes EP's Anti-China Resolutions (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been proved over the past years that whatever tricks the
Dalai Lama has used, they could not cover up his attempt and
nature to split the motherland. "He is no longer a pure religious
leader, but a political figure in exile who is congenial to
foreign anti-China forces attempting to bring his dreams of 'Tibet
independence' into reality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regardless the fact, he said, EP made unwarranted charges
against the Chinese government and required it to open dialogues
with the Dalai Lama "without pre-conditions." However, it called
on the Chinese government to conduct negotiations on the basis of
the so-called "Five Peaceful Points" proposed by the Dalai Lama. "
Isn't it self-contradictory?" he asked. "In view of this, the EP
resolution, in boosting the Dalai group's separatist position and
activities, has violently intervened in China's internal affairs,
Isn't it more in conformity to the fact?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the 56th U.N. Human Rights Commission
session in Geneva, some people in EP echoed the anti-China noises
on the other side of the ocean and set off a new anti-China wave,
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"They are willfully trying to impose their own human rights
standards upon China, and do not mind taking the trouble to
deliberately and repeatedly press and confront with China on the
Taiwan and Tibet questions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel Files Complaint Over Katyusha Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Wednesday filed a
complaint with the Grapes of Wrath Monitoring Committee (GWMC),
accusing Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas for their Katyusha attacks
against Israel's northern civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military said that several long-range 122-millimeter
Katyusha rockets fired by Hezbollah guerrillas hit western Galilee,
northern Israel, Tuesday afternoon. One of them hit the road at the
entrance to a settlement, which damaged an electricity transformer
and caused a blackout in the region for several hours.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the
north was ordered to be on alert, as the Israeli military said that
the Katyusha attack against the Israeli civilians was deliberate
and categorized it as "very grave."
</P>
<P>
Israel has in the compliant asked the GWMC to investigate the
incident and warned that if Hezbollah guerrillas fire more Katyusha
rockets against northern Israel, Israel will respond drastically,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The GWMC, a five-nation group, was set up to supervise the
understandings reached at the end of the Operation Grapes of Wrath
in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel Air Force fighter jets struck several Hezbollah targets
early Wednesday morning in south Lebanon in an apparent move to
retaliate for the Tuesday Katyusha attacks.
</P>
<P>
But no immediate reports of casualties among the Lebanese were
reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Katyusha attacks came at the peak of a day of heavy
skirmishing in southern Lebanon that left one Syrian construction
worker dead and five people injured, including two IDF soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military said the long-range 122-millimeter caliber
Katyusha model fired by Hezbollah on Tuesday has not been in use
for some time.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by Iran and Syria, is one of
the Lebanese resistance forces that have been fighting against the
Israeli occupation of south Lebanon since 1978.

<HEADLINE> Canal Project Proposed to Dig Thailand Out of Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kra Canal project will help
pull Thailand out of present economic crisis and act as an
impetus to the country's economy, a long time advocate of the
project said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Pakdee Tananpura, an adviser to
the Subcommittee for the Study of the Kra Canal Project under the
House Committee on Military Affairs, said the economic crisis has
jeopardized the national security of Thailand, leaving thousands
of businesses failed and 4 million people unemployed.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, the canal project, which represents an
investment of approximately 20 billion U.S. dollars, can jump-
start the country's economy by providing 3 million jobs and
numerous business chances, Pakdee said.
</P>
<P>
The Kra Canal, named for the narrowest part of the peninsula
Thailand shares with Malaysia, will link the Gulf of Thailand of
the Pacific Ocean and the Andaman Sea of the Indian Ocean, and
provide some 1,660-kilometer shortcut for European freighters and
Middle East oil tankers traveling to and from East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Pakdee admitted that by using the Kra Canal rather than going
through the Malacca Strait ships would save only 36 hours instead
of days and weeks as is the case for the Panama Canal and the Suez
Canal.
</P>
<P>
However, he argued, the feasibility of the Kra Canal lies in
the fact that it will help ease the traffic congestion in the
Malacca Strait.
</P>
<P>
He said approximately 40 percent of world liner shipment of
containerized cargo in the year 1997 was traded in the Asia-
Pacific region, and there are approximately 150,000 ships passing
through the Malacca Strait with an expected annual growth of 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2020, there will most likely be over 450,000 ships
going through the strait, Pakdee said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Kra Canal is constructed by the year 2020, it will
definitely help ease the traffic congestion in the Malacca Strait,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Construction contractors from Japan, Germany, France and China
have expressed investment interest in the project, Pakdee said.
</P>
<P>
However, the committee needs to lobby hard to persuade the Thai
public and government to buy the idea, he said.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Invited to Swearing-in of Rwandan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni, whose relations with Rwandan President-elect Paul Kagame
have been strained for several months, has been invited to attend
the April 22 swearing-in ceremony of the latter.
</P>
<P>
Hope Kivengere, presidential press secretary, told Xinhua on
Wednesday that Museveni had not yet decided whether to go to
Kigali or not.
</P>
<P>
"He has been invited, but I don't know whether he will attend.
If he can't make it, he will have to delegate," said Kivengere.
</P>
<P>
"I can't confirm one way or the other because I know he has got
some other duties outside the country," she added.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Uganda and Rwanda were badly damaged when
the two countries' armies went into clash in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) in August, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Up to 200 soldiers from both sides were reportedly killed in
the shoot- out which took place in the DRC's northeastern city of
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
"If Museveni turns up at the Kagame's swearing-in ceremony, it
is a sign that there is a chance to improve the relationship
between the two governments," an analyst said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kagame was elected president by Rwandan parliamentarians and
ministers on April 17, replacing Pasteur Bizimungu, who resigned
last month.
</P>
<P>
Kagame is the first Tutsi president in the land-locked
Hutu-dominant central African country since its independence in
1962.
</P>
<P>
Kagame, also chairman of the ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front
(RPF), was vice president and minister of defense of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He has been widely believed to be holding the real reins of
power in the country since RPF came to power in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Presidency, Legislature Seek Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo and principal officials of the country's top legislature,
the National Assembly, have opened talks on their recent raw over
budget, presidential jet and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Wednesday cited
sources as saying that both sides had pledged to sheath their
swords.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which came a day after Obasanjo returned from the
G-77 summit Monday, was attended by Senate President William
Okadigbo and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives
Chibudom Nwuche, among others, on the legislative side.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Obasanjo as telling the Assemblymen that he
and the Nigerian delegation to the G-77 summit were "distracted
and embarrassed by the spate of media war between the Presidency
and the legislature within the past one week."
</P>
<P>
He said it was unbecoming for such high officials in a country
to engage in open bickering like "school kids".
</P>
<P>
The development was much worse as such hot exchange of words
could raise tempers within the polity and send wrong signals to
both Nigerians and the international community that there was a
crisis within the Nigerian leadership, he added.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the law makers, Senate leader Okadigbo said the
Assembly leadership did not join in the open feud as their aides
simply replied those of the Presidency to set the record straight
in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
He complained about the scathing press reports, accusing them
of portraying the Assembly in poor light.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo called for a truce while both sides and the ruling
People's Democratic Party (PDP) work out the differences,
especially on the year 2000 budget and other matters.
</P>
<P>
Both parties agreed to meet regularly, especially whenever
disagreements arise between them.
</P>
<P>
However, no details on the discussion pertaining to Senator
Arthur Nzeribe, who had initiated an impeachment move against
Obasanjo, was released.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the Presidency and the legislature of
Nigeria had been particularly frosty for about two weeks, with
operatives of both sides engaging in a media war.

<HEADLINE> S. African Markets Affected by Zimbabwe's Situation: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The deteriorating economic
and political situation in Zimbabwe has affected the mood of
investors in South African markets, said Governor of the South
African Reserve Bank Tito Mboweni on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the Zimbabwe situation is adding to some negative
mood and sentiment, and the quicker they resolve their issues
there, the better for us," he told members of the National
Assembly's finance portfolio committee.
</P>
<P>
Four Zimbabweans have died recently in violence over the
forthcoming elections and the seizure of white-owned farms by war
veterans.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni noted that developments in any of the world's emerging
markets is bound to have an impact on South Africa's economy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on South Africa's foreign exchange rate, he said the
 difference in inflation levels between South Africa and its main
trading partners could lead to "systematic and contained
depreciation" of rand, the currency of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The current exchange rate is "not as bad as people think" and
will stabilize in a short term due to South Africa's free trade
agreement with the European Union, he said.

<HEADLINE> Science Proves Prince Died in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Belgian and German scientists have
proved through genetic analysis that the son of France's King
Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette died in a Paris prison in
1795.
</P>
<P>
Through analysis of the DNA taken from his heart, a 10-year-
old boy who died of tuberculosis in a tower of the Temple prison
in Paris in June 1795 was determined to be Louis XVII, Agence
France Presse reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jean-Jacques Cassiman of the University of Louvain in
Belgium and Professor Ernst Brinckmann of the University of
Munster in Germany proved genes taken from the heart of the boy
were identical to those of his mother and aunts and two
descendants of the former French royal family.
</P>
<P>
After the boy died on June 8, 1795, a doctor named Philippe-
Jean Pelletan made an autopsy of his body and took his heart,
which he kept in a box filled with wine to prevent it from
decaying.
</P>
<P>
The heart has been kept since 1975 in the Basilique of Saint-
Denis north of Paris, where the remains of Louis XVI and Queen
Marie-Antoinette were also kept.
</P>
<P>
The king and the queen were executed by guillotine in January
1793 during the rein of terror by Jacobin.

<HEADLINE> Former Russian PM Appointed Audit Chamber Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's lower house of parliament
on Wednesday appointed former prime minister Sergei Stepashin as
head of the country's Audit Chamber.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was approved by a vote of 309-29 with 10
abstentions in the State Duma, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Audit Chamber is a government fiscal control body formed
by the Federal Assembly (parliament) and accountable to it. The
chamber exercises control over the timely execution of the federal
budget and federal non-budget funds.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, who had also served as interior minister before the
start of his three-month premiership last May, laid out his plan
to improve the effectiveness of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
The body should become the chief financial tool to supervise
the use of budget funds and fight corruption, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, who also heads the Corruption Fighting Committee,
said the Audit Chamber should continuously cooperate with the
president, both houses of parliament and the cabinet, which it has
failed to do so far.
</P>
<P>
He called for amending the legislation to make the chamber
more accountable and powerful. He also pledged to avoid
unnecessary politicking in the operations of the Audit Chamber,
noting that various lobbies had in the past tried to use the
chamber to serve their own purposes.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin was elected to the State Duma last December as a
leader of the liberal Yabloko movement from St. Petersburg.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian Royal Academy of
Medicine is advising against the import of blood and blood
products from Britain, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The medical agency said anyone who spent longer than six months
in Britain between 1980 and 1996 should also not donate blood.
</P>
<P>
The measures are meant to protect Belgians against the possible
transfer of Creutzfeldt Jacob disease -- the human variant of Mad
Cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jean Plum of the Royal Academy of Medicine said that
the highest prevalence of the disease has been in Britain, and
Creutzfeldt Jacob could be transferred through blood.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore better to take precautionary measures omitting
British blood products from supplies in Belgium, he said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Company Focuses on Enterprise E-commerce, Western Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Alibaba.com Corporation, a major
on-line commercial service provider, announced today that it will
focus on providing e-commerce solutions for domestic enterprises
and developing China's western regions.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yun, chief executive officer of the Hong Kong-based company,
said that Alibaba's main development strategy is to help domestic
small and medium-sized enterprises adjust to e-commerce before
China enters the World Trade Organization (WTO), and build e-
commerce platforms for the development of China's west.
</P>
<P>
Yu Weixiang, a multinational trade researcher with the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), noted that e-
commerce will become form of trade in the 21st century. "Under the
WTO framework, price competition will no longer be the decisive
factor for enterprises. They must depend on e-commerce to minimize
costs and improve efficiency," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the country's western areas where infrastructure is under-
developed and access to information limited, e-commerce will be
the easiest way for enterprises, especially, small and medium-
sized ones to communicate with the rest of the world, said Ma.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Alibaba clinched a 20-million-dollar deal
with the Japan-based investment company Softbank.
</P>
<P>
Alibaba claimed it has over 180,000 customers worldwide, with
new a 1,000 new customers increasing by the day.

<HEADLINE> NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Leader Refutes EP's Anti-China Resolutions (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the Tibet issue, the EP resolution on Tibet groundlessly
accuses China with the lies concocted by the Dalai group, and
smears and unreasonably criticizes China for "occupation of Tibet",
the official said.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that Tibet is an inalienable part of the
Chinese territory, and it has remained a piece of the Chinese
territory since the 13th century, the official pointed out. The
current 14th Dalai Lama, who is now in exile, was anointed with
the approval by the then President of the Chinese National
Government. "Since Tibet is part of the Chinese territory, how can
it be concluded that the Chinese government has occupied Tibet?"
the official asked.
</P>
<P>
The resolution alleged that the Chinese government
discriminates against the Tibetan people and violates human rights
there is also sheer fabrication, he said. Numerous facts have
proven that in the past 50 years, especially since the
implementation of the democratic reform in Tibet after the flee of
the Dalai Lama in 1959, great changes have taken place in Tibet,
and this period of time has witnessed the best development in
Tibet's history, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the old Tibet ruled by the Dalai Lama when the feudal
serfdom which combined the religion with politics was carried out,
the cruelty and misery suffered by the Tibetan people were even
harsher than that of the medieval Europe, making Tibet one of the
worst places in the world of the 20th century where human rights
were trampled most seriously, he said, adding that 95 percent of
the Tibetans were serfs and slaves without any personal freedom at
that time.

"After the democratic reform was introduced in Tibet in 1959,
the feudal serfdom was abolished and some one million serfs and
slaves were emancipated. The ethnic regional autonomy being
applied, and the Tibetan people have become the masters of their
own destiny," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the support of the Central Government, Tibet has
achieved fast economic development and social progress. People's
living standard is improving continuously, the ethnic culture,
education and public health greatly advanced, and the freedom of
religious beliefs and the citizens' basic rights and freedoms
protected, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, during the 200 years before 1959,
the population in Tibet had long been fluctuating at around one
million, while at present its population has reached 2.44 million,
with ethnic Tibetans accounting to 95 percent. The average life
expectancy of Tibetans has increased from 36 years in 1959 to 65
years now.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet today can be considered one of the places in the world
where the human rights cause has developed fastest and best," he
said, adding that "This is a fact known to all."
</P>
<P>
"Anyone with reasonable sense can hardly believe that such
enormous achievements have been made through the 'discrimination
of the Tibetan people' and human rights abuses," the official said.
Only the Dalai Lama, a die-hard separatist who advocates "Tibet
independence", will not and dare not recognize such an irrefutable
fact, he added.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir Hopes to Boost Ties With Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani voiced hope on Wednesday that the arrival of
Bahrain's first ambassador would help enhance relations between the
two small Gulf Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Hamad made the remarks in the Qatari capital Doha when receiving
credentials presented by Bahraini Ambassador to Qatar Essa Mohammed
Al-Jame, according to a report by the Kuwait News Agency from Doha.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari monarch hoped Al-Jame would be successful in carrying
out his mission in strengthening the recently improved ties between
Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Bahrain agreed to exchange ambassadors during a
landmark visit to Bahrain by the Qatari emir, which took place on
December 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In their summit meeting, Hamad and his Bahraini counterpart
Sheikh Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifa also agreed to set up a joint
committee to try to settle a border dispute through cordial means.
</P>
<P>
Doha and Manama are locked in a dispute over several small but
potentially oil-and-gas-rich Gulf isles, including the Hawar
islands, which are controlled by Bahrain since 1930s but also
claimed by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been taken to the International Court of Justice,
waiting for a verdict.
</P>
<P>
But the two countries have agreed that the case will be
withdrawn if an acceptable solution is reached before the court's
verdict by the joint committee, which is co-chaired by their crown
princes.
</P>
<P>
On January 6, the Bahraini emir visited Doha, just nine days
after Qatari emir's trip to Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
During the exchange of visits, both sides reiterated that the
long-running border standoff should not hamper bilateral
cooperation in all other fields.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Terrorist Group Beheads 2 Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine extremist group Abu
Sayyaf beheaded Wednesday two of their 29 hostages after the
government rejected their demand to ask the United States to
release three Arab terrorists jailed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sabaya, spokesman of the Muslim fundamentalist group,
announced the execution of the two hostages during a live radio
interview Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, the Armed Forces of the Philippines declined to
confirm the reported beheading incident, saying they would wait
for verification by their men in Basilan province where the
hostages have been held since March this year.
</P>
<P>
The two hostages were executed at 3:15 Wednesday afternoon,
Sabaya said, adding that the group will behead more hostages every
time the Presidential Palace "makes a negative statement."
</P>
<P>
Sabaya did not identify the executed hostages, except that they
were reportedly former soldiers turned teachers. Sabaya said there
are still 27 hostages in their hands.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf had give a 3 p.m. deadline Wednesday for the
government to relay their demands to the U.S. government for the
release of three Arab international terrorists imprisoned in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Another Abu Sayyaf demand is for the government to send an
additional 85 sacks of rice. They had earlier asked for 200 sacks
of rice which the Crisis Management Committee (CMC) reluctantly
granted.
</P>
<P>
The CMC is handling the negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf for
the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim extremist group has also threatened to kill or
kidnap Americans in the country after the Philippine government
rejected their demands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Basilan Governor Wahab Akbar warned the Abu Sayyaf
that he will personally lead the assault of the terrorists'
mountain lair in the province if the fundamentalist group would
not release the hostages by April 30.

HANOI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ninth plenum of the Communist
Party of Vietnam Central Committee (CPV CC) concluded Wednesday
afternoon with a decision to take disciplinary measures against
three members of the CPV CC, a high-ranking official of CPV CC
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dao Duy Quat, vice chairman of the Ideological Cultural
Department of CPV CC, told a press conference here Wednesday that
the plenum decided to serve warning to Secretary of Binh Thuan
Provincial Party Committee Dinh Trung for his responsibility to
Tanh Linh forest fire and losing solidarity in his provincial
party committee.
</P>
<P>
The plenum also decided to serve reprimands to Secretary of
Hanoi Municipal Party Committee Hoang Van Nghien and Minister of
Planning and Investment Tran Xuan Gia for their responsibility to
the construction of Thuy Cung Thang Long (Thang Long Crystal
Palace).
</P>
<P>
Quat said the 9th plenum of CPV CC, which began on April 10,

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Presidency, Legislature Seek Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo and principal officials of the country's top legislature,
the National Assembly, have opened talks on their recent raw over
budget, presidential jet and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Wednesday cited
sources as saying that both sides had pledged to sheath their
swords.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which came a day after Obasanjo returned from the
G-77 summit Monday, was attended by Senate President William
Okadigbo and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives
Chibudom Nwuche, among others, on the legislative side.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Obasanjo as telling the Assemblymen that he
and the Nigerian delegation to the G-77 summit were "distracted
and embarrassed by the spate of media war between the Presidency
and the legislature within the past one week."
</P>
<P>
He said it was unbecoming for such high officials in a country
to engage in open bickering like "school kids".
</P>
<P>
The development was much worse as such hot exchange of words
could raise tempers within the polity and send wrong signals to
both Nigerians and the international community that there was a
crisis within the Nigerian leadership, he added.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the law makers, Senate leader Okadigbo said the
Assembly leadership did not join in the open feud as their aides
simply replied those of the Presidency to set the record straight
in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
He complained about the scathing press reports, accusing them
of portraying the Assembly in poor light.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo called for a truce while both sides and the ruling
People's Democratic Party (PDP) work out the differences,
especially on the year 2000 budget and other matters.
</P>
<P>
Both parties agreed to meet regularly, especially whenever
disagreements arise between them.
</P>
<P>
However, no details on the discussion pertaining to Senator
Arthur Nzeribe, who had initiated an impeachment move against
Obasanjo, was released.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the Presidency and the legislature of
Nigeria had been particularly frosty for about two weeks, with
operatives of both sides engaging in a media war.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema announced Wednesday that he would resign to take
responsibility for the center-left party's defeat in last Sunday's
regional elections.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema told the Senate that he would meet President Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi later Wednesday to confirm his decision to resign.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema admitted that Sunday's defeat was a blow both for
himself and his government.
</P>
<P>
Although there was no institutional obligation for the
government to resign, D'Alema said, it was clear that his
government has lost a vote of confidence and it was best that it
resign.
</P>
<P>
However, D'Alema stressed, Sunday's vote was in no way one
against the current legislature and therefore there was no reason
for it to be dissolved.
</P>
<P>
There are only eleven months left for the mandate of the
current legislature, D'Alema said. Time should be used to
consolidate economic and social reforms and to draft a new
electoral law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the performance of his 18-month executive, the
premier recalled the achievements made in both the economic and
social areas but admitted that more could have been done.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema promised that he will remain at the service of the
center-left government in whatever capacity and that he will be
personally involved in the campaign for next week's referendum on
electoral law reform.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Renowned Panda Expert Wins Getty Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's renowned giant panda
expert Pan Wenshi has become this year's Getty Wildlife
Conservation Prize recipient, and is the first Chinese to win the
prestigious award, according to sources with the World Wildlife
Fund.
</P>
<P>
Pan told Xinhua here today that he plans to use the 100,000 U.S.
dollar-prize to set up a fund for giant panda research and
protection projects in national reserves, where working conditions
are hard.
</P>
<P>
The Getty Prize, which WWF administers on behalf of the family
of the late billionaire J. Paul Getty, honors those who have made
pioneering and substantial contributions to animal research. The
annual prize was set up 1974.
</P>
<P>
Ginette Hemley, WWF's vice president for endangered species
conservation, congratulated Pan, calling him "a passionate and
tireless advocate on behalf of panda conservation".
</P>
<P>
"Pan has contributed enormously to our understanding of the
giant panda," Hemley said.
</P>
<P>
Pan, director of the Giant Panda and Wildlife Conservation
Research Center with Beijing University, was chosen both for his
achievements over a career spanning some 20 years and for his role
in convincing the government to impose a ban on logging in the
Changqing area in the Qinling Mountains in northwest China, and
set up a nature reserve there.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign giant panda experts agree that one of the
biggest threats facing the giant panda today is the diminishing
habitat from logging and other economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Pan has contributed greatly to bringing about a moratorium on
logging and to the set-up of the Changqing reserve with an
appropriation worth 50 million yuan (6 million US dollars) from
the Chinese government and 4.7 million US dollars of World Bank
loans. The reserve, with a core area covered by 305 sq.km. of
dense forest, is now home to over 200 giant pandas and 80
varieties of animals.
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Fuller, president of World Wildlife Fund-US, said "it
has been a long and hard journey to get to the point where we can
be guardedly optimistic about the panda's fate, but we have done
it because Professor Pan's success made us confident that the
future is hopeful."
</P>
<P>
The award is Pan's fourth international honor. Nominees of the
Getty Prize are chosen by WWF and the winner is selected by a jury
of eminent conservationists. The award carries with it national
and international recognition and a cash prize.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Business Conference Held In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- An international conference to
discuss business incubation and technology innovation was held
Tuesday in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Attending the two-day conference were 494 domestic and overseas
hi-tech experts, scholars, investors as well as government
officials.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, vice chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and also
president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), gave an
opening-day speech on the prospect of business incubation and
technology innovation in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is designed to encourage the country's young
service providers to help hi-tech developers and was jointly
sponsored by U.N. Development Program and the Ministry of Science
and Technology, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, the Ministry of Education, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, and the CAE.
</P>
<P>
The term "business incubation" originated in the US in the
1950s, when some companies and organizations were set up to offer
package services to venture firms, which included providing
production and communications systems as well as financial and
legal consultation.
</P>
<P>
Such services are important for cutting production costs and
bridging the transformation period from research findings to
products.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998 there were over 3,300 business incubation
companies around the world, mainly based in the US and Europe.
Business incubation emerged in China about ten years ago, and the
country now has over 100 such companies.

<HEADLINE> NPC Foreign Affairs Committee Leader Refutes EP's Anti-China Resolutions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A leading official with the
Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese National People's
Congress (NPC) today expressed "strong indignation and
condemnation" against the anti-China resolutions on Taiwan and
Tibet adopted by the European Parliament (EP) on April 12
disregarding the solemn representations made by China.
</P>
<P>
The official described the resolutions as "wantonly distorting
and accusing China's Taiwan policy and slandering the Chinese
government of 'occupation of Tibet' and 'repression' of Tibetan
people."
</P>
<P>
These two resolutions called on European Union member states to
"step up" relations with Taiwan and urged the Chinese government
to "open the dialogue, without pre-conditions, on the future of
Tibet with the Dalai Lama on the basis of his so-called 'five-
point peace plan'," according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The official stated that Taiwan has been a part of China from
ancient times. "Its temporary separation from the mainland is just
a legacy of China's civil war," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been consistently upholding the
policy of resolving the Taiwan issue through "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems" and realizing the
complete reunification of the motherland under the one China
principle, he noted.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets Romanian Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), met
with a delegation of the Party of Social Democracy of Romania at
the Great Hall of the People this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by Adrian Nastase, first vice-president
of the Party of Social Democracy of Romania (PSD) and also vice-
president of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania, is visiting China
at the invitation of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, extended a warm welcome to
the delegation and spoke highly of Sino-Romanian relations, noting
that although changes have taken place in both countries and the
world at large, a good momentum has been maintained for relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people deeply treasure the
friendship with Romania, and are willing to bring a steady,
healthy and comprehensive bilateral relationship into the new
century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also noted the NPC strongly supports cooperation with the
Romanian parliament, and that contacts between parliament leaders,
friendship committees and specialized committees would all benefit
the traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he had high praise for relations between the CPC and
the PSD, noting the CPC is willing to communicate with the PSD and
other Romanian parties on the basis of independence, total
equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nastase said although Romania and China are far apart, they
have maintained a close friendship which will continue no matter
which party comes into rule. The PSD has always supported China on
the Taiwan and human rights issues, he said, expressing the hope
that both political and economic cooperation would be reinforced
in the future.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua)-- Beijing Public Transportation
Corporation (BJPT) purchased 500 compressed natural gas (CNG)
engines from Cummins Engine Company in the United States today.
</P>
<P>
BJPT bought 300 compressed gas engines from Cummins on the eve
of the 50th Chinese national day in 1999. With these additional
500 units of CNG engines, BJPT will become the largest CNG fleet
in Asia-Pacific region and the second largest in the world.
</P>

ceremony that the company is considering to buy another 1,000
Cummins engines this year if the already-purchased engines work
well.

<P>
However, the official said, for many years, a handful of
separatist advocates for "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas"
represented by Lee Teng-hui have gone against the trend of the
times and resorted to various conspiratorial means to split the
motherland, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Recently, he said, the "Taiwan independence" advocate Annette
Lu was too impatient to start preaching her nonsense of the so-
called "two Chinese countries" between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits in an attempt to split Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
"Regarding such doings, we solemnly declare that no matter what
means the local authorities of Taiwan adopt and whoever becomes
the leader there, the fact that there is only one China in the
world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory can
never be altered," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Chinese government's principled
position has been universally recognized by the international
community and definitely validated by the international law.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese government holds fast the stand of
peaceful reunification, yet it will under no circumstances commit
itself to renunciation of the use of force. "Providing an
essential guarantee for striving for peaceful reunification, this
stand is meant to counter the conspiracy of 'Taiwan independence'
and the foreign forces who want to get in the way in the
reunification of China," he said.

The efforts made by the forces for the "independence of Taiwan"
will prove futile, and they are doomed to failure, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a sovereign state, China has every right to realize the
reunification of the motherland by all means in order to ensure
its state sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said, adding
that no country has any right to pass judgments on and wantonly
intervene in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that disregarding the solemn and just
stand of the Chinese government on the Taiwan issue, the EP
adopted the Resolution on Taiwan, brazenly expressing their
appreciation of the separatists who advocate "Taiwan independence"
and providing them with support.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also calls on EU member states to "step up their
relations with Taiwan with a view to securing better
representation for Taiwan in international fora," and even open a
European Commission Representative office in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The official said all the above-mentioned EP proposals run
counter to the one China principle which EU member states have
reaffirmed many times, and will do nothing good to ease the
tension of the relations across the Taiwan Straits, but will
foster the arrogance of the Taiwan separatists, prevent the
peaceful reunification of China and affect severely the hard-won
normal Chinese-European relations.
</P>
<P>
"We will absolutely not tolerate such a situation," he added.

<P>
Today's Science and Technology Daily reported that this is
China's first batch of IC phonecard chips with intellectual
property rights exported to Europe.
</P>
<P>
The daily said Datang and a French company will jointly export
another 25 million chips to the European market.
</P>
<P>
The chips are developed by a micro-electronics company, a
subsidiary of Datang made up of 13 merged telecom research
institutes and high-tech ventures.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic market needs over 100 million phonecard chips
annually to meet market demand; in the past the country depended
entirely on imported chips.
</P>
<P>
The phonecard chips made by Datang occupy about 50 percent of
the domestic market. So far Datang has an annual phone card chip
production capacity of 110 million.
</P>
<P>
The central government has taken steps to encourage scientific
research institutions to become more market-oriented and to push

Realizing that promoting foreign trade and investment is a
vital way out for the poverty-ridden and landlocked Himalayan

made economic diplomacy a top agenda in its foreign policy,
focusing on issues of expanding foreign trade, taking in
investments and promoting Nepal as an attractive tourist
destination.

diplomacy and pledged to create friendly environment to promote
trade and investments.

investment in his country, pledging to extend full support and
cooperations.
</P>
<P>
"You can invest in whatever sector you desire," Koirala said. "
In addition to selected manufacturing and service industries,
tourism and water resources are the prominent areas of foreign
investment in Nepal, " the prime minister elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that Nepal has become a better place for investment
and trade in the South Asian region, Koirala said the trade policy
in the country has been further liberalized by eliminating
quantitative restriction and import licenses and by reducing and
rationalizing tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Export Promotion Meeting, organized by the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce, was the climax of a series of
trade promotion meetings and trade fairs in the recent month,
including"Tradex-2000" on March 30-April 3, "Trade Fair-2000" on
April 4-8, and so on.
</P>
<P>
The one-month long trade and investment promotion activities
were the initiative steps taken by the government in achieving its
targets.
</P>
<P>
The largest and most significant of all was the Export
Promotion Meeting-2000, the first-ever international trade meeting
in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the meeting were about 450 delegates,
representing 34 countries including Australia, Canada, China,
Japan, India,Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The meeting and fair provided foreign diplomats and businessmen
with a unique opportunity to hear detailed policy preference from
the concerned ministers and business leaders on Nepal's continued
efforts towards promoting foreign trade, seeking foreign markets,
attracting foreign investment and projecting the country's image
as tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Foreign employment, export and tourism are three biggest
earners of foreign currency for Nepal. According to statistics,
tourism income in 1998 reached 152.5 million U.S. dollars,
representing 4 percent of the country's GNP, while foreign workers
remitted 990 million U.S. dollars in 1997, accounting for nearly
25 percent of its GNP.
</P>
<P>
However, Nepal has long suffered from trade deficit, though the
export was the biggest foreign currency earner excluding labor
export.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the Finance Ministry showed that in 1997/1998
fiscal year, export stood at 392.4 million U.S. dollars while
import reached 1268.5 million U.S. dollars, with a deficit of 876.
1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
To further expand export and improve the trade deficit, the
government will soon formulate the National Export Policy to help
sustain export markets while guiding and protecting exporters,
according to an official of the National Planning Commission.

<P>
MOGADISHU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 people have died
of cholera in the drought-hit southern Somali region of Bay in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
According to Madey Mukhtar Ali, chairman of Ufurow Commune,
some 20 km northwest of Qansahdhereh District, the worst affected
is Bulo Addey Village where the death has exceeded 40 people since
Tuesday after the people of the village began falling for the
disease in their dozens. He said the situation has steadily been
worsening since the beginning of the week.
</P>
<P>
The disease is now further spreading to more villages such as
Mushkah and Adad Wanleh where six and two deaths have been
reported respectively Wednesday morning and more villages south of
Qansahdhere District are now being affected.
</P>
<P>
According to the local authorities in Bay region the spread of
the disease is being supported by the drought which is forcing the
people to keep moving around in search of water and food.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of families are known to have fled their villages and
 countryside owing to the drought as no sufficient rains have
fallen in the region in the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
The governor of Bay region, Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinleh, said his
region is in desperate need of help owing to the combination of
droughts and cholera epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The worst affected districts are Dinsor and Qansahdhereh of Bay
region where more than 57 people died of cholera last week, which
makes the total death toll to nearly 130 people since the
beginning of the month.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Northeast china's Liaoning
Province, one of China's major industrial bases, are making
efforts to promote the development of small- and medium-sized
enterprises as one of solutions to its problems in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
At present, the 400,000 small- and medium sized enterprises in
the province employ 8 million people, accounting for 40 percent of
the labor force engaged in various industries and services.
</P>
<P>
The added-value of the enterprises reached 129.9 billion yuan (
15.28 billion U.S. dollars) last year, accounting for 73 percent
of the industrial added-value in the province.
</P>
<P>
The taxes turned over by the small- and medium-sized
enterprises took up 31.6 percent of the total of the industrial
enterprises in Liaoning last year.
</P>
<P>
With a high proportion of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
Liaoning has a heavy task in the SOE reform and helping them
overcome difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guoguang, governor of the province, said that Liaoning
has set a strategy to promote its economic growth by developing
small- and medium-sized enterprises, noting that the province will
focus on promoting a great batch of small and medium-sized
enterprises engaged in development of new and high technology and
export-oriented business.
</P>
<P>
This year the Finance Department of Liaoning Province invested
60 million yuan (7 million U.S. dollars) in the establishment of a
scientific and technological guarantee company to help small- and
medium-sized enterprises engage in technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is also formulating preferential policies for the
small- and medium-sized enterprises so as to broaden their
operation scope.

TIANJIN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Business Network Inc.
has signed an agreement with the Tianjin Municipal Enterprise

</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the two sides will draw on their respective
advantages in a joint effort to provide local enterprises with

</P>
<P>
The Tianjin association, founded in 1978, has over 1,000
members mainly from machine-building, electronic and chemical
industries. The U.S. company entered the Chinese market in late
1997 and has established cooperative ties with the cities of
Shanghai, Dalian and Shenzhen before Tianjin. The total

<HEADLINE> Germany Helping China Tackle Pollution of Agricultural Products(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany will offer technical and
financial support through a Sino-German program to help China
tackle contamination of its agricultural products, according to a
symposium here today.
</P>
<P>
The program, named Environmental Strategies of Intensive
Agriculture in North China, will set up pilot zones in north China
to promote environmental protection strategies for intensive
farming.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baowen, vice Agricultural Minister, said today at the
symposium for the Sino-German program that the rapid growth of
agriculture in recent years has brought along such issues as
environment pollution and food contamination, which might hinder
China's sustained growth of agriculture if left untackled.
</P>
<P>
"China is facing great challenges as it seeks entry to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) amidst pressures brought by its
huge population and worsening environment. China's agriculture
must be internationally-oriented and make its farm produce more
competitive in the global market," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the program will introduce German expertise in
environmentally-friendly intensive farming to China, which may
help China improve its environmental conditions while producing
enough food.
</P>
<P>
With 22 percent of the world's population and only seven
percent of the world's arable land, China has no choice but turn
to intensive agriculture to feed its people.
</P>
<P>
Intensive agriculture, largely dependent upon massive use of
chemical fertilizer and pesticides, has produced environmental
problems in many regions in China due to farmers' lack of
knowledge of the products they are using.
</P>
<P>
Large amounts of fertilizer, which cannot be totally absorbed
by crops, pollutes both the air and the underground water. And
the pesticide residue on vegetables hazards health.

<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Glory Project, a national
anti-poverty project, should be actively involved in the
development of the country's vast west, a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, president of the China Glory Project Promotion
Association, noted that the western development has given the
project room to grow.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the first session of the second council of
the association, the official stressed that the project will
benefit this and future generations.
</P>
<P>
Since it was initiated in 1994 by private businesspeople, 3,508
private entrepreneurs have so far joined in the project, funding 3,
829 projects with more than 10 billion yuan of investment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they also helped train 733,600 poor people, find
jobs for 761,500, and enable nearly two million people to have
sufficient food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Wang, also vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the
United Front Work Department of Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, said while developing the west, special emphasis must
be placed on environmental protection, education and
infrastructure.

<P>
The official noted that despite their repeated claims that
their actions are not politically motivated, Li and his followers
have colluded with anti-China forces and become their political
tool.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the true faces of Li and his followers were further
exposed when they joined the anti-China forces in pushing forward
the U.S. anti-China motion at the 56th session of the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that on March 2 the Falun Gong groups in Canada
held a press conference together with the so-called democracy
movement organizations and those calling for Tibetan independence.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the group pressed the Canadian government to
follow the U.S. lead on the motion against China and to link its
trade with China with the country's human rights status.
</P>
<P>
On March 16, Li sent his assistant Zhang Erping to the "China
religious freedom" hearing in the U.S. to provide more ammunition
for the anti-China motion.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Li organized a group of Falun Gong followers
to go to Geneva where the 56th session of the U.N Commission on
Human Rights was being held. There they held press conferences,
collected signatures on petitions and sponsored other anti-China
activities.
</P>
<P>
"All these acts and more have clearly indicated that Li Hongzhi
and his Falun Gong organization have publicly given themselves up
to the anti-China forces and actively served as their anti-China
tool," the official said.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has won
decisive victory in its ongoing battle against Falun Gong, but the
cult group led by Li Hongzhi has not recognized their defeat and
continues to cause trouble, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
This year in particular, the cult has collaborated with
overseas anti-China forces and become their political tool. The
struggle against Falun Gong is long-term, complex and serious, the
official-in-charge of the State Council Press Office said in a
recent interview with the Hong Kong-based newspaper, Wen Wei Po.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the government has worked to educate the
majority of Falun Gong practitioners, while cracking down,
according to law, on a handful of those who have engaged in
criminal activity and jeopardized the public safety.
</P>
<P>
Of the two million-plus Falun Gong practitioners, more than 98
percent have recognized the true nature of the cult and
relinquished their ties to it, with the help of their families and
work units.
</P>
<P>
So far, the cult has been directly responsible for 1,500 deaths
-- more than the number killed by the Ugandan "Ten Commandments of
God" cult. Meanwhile, over 600 people have become mentally ill
after practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
China has shown no mercy in its crackdown against organizers
and backbone members of the cult, the official said.
</P>
<P>
As of March 25, 91 Falun Gong-related cases had been handled by
Chinese courts at different levels. Of the 99 people who had been
involved in these cases and sentenced by the courts, 84 received
prison sentences and 15 were exempted from criminal punishment. (

<P>
Since July 22, 1999, Falun Gong members have been causing
trouble on and around Tian'anmen Square in central Beijing nearly
every day, under orders from cult leader Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
The number of Falun Gong troublemakers rises on significant
dates or when important activities are scheduled, such as Spring
Festival, sessions of the National People's Congress and the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, and visits of high-level foreign guests.
</P>
<P>
Some of these troublemakers were practicing Falun Gong, some
were protesting, banners in hand and shouting slogans, and some
were even attempting to detonate explosives, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
A Falun Gong member surnamed Li, who came to Beijing from
northern Hebei Province, attempted to detonate explosives strapped
to his body but was stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
During Spring Festival, the traditional Chinese New Year, more
than 1,000 Falun Gong members gathered on the square in an attempt
to hold an activity they called "Guarding Falun Gong on Tian'anmen
Square in the Millennium of the Chinese Lunar Calendar."
</P>
<P>
Local police said this was a demonstration jointly organized by
Falun Gong members at home and abroad, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the direction of Li Hongzhi, some backbone elements of
Falun Gong spread rumors and deceived the followers.
</P>
<P>
The followers were told to "publicize" Falun Gong in Beijing at
the time, or else miss their chance for "salvation" and the loss
of the "religious strength" they had gained through practicing
Falun Gong.

The official also said that despite their claims of
truthfulness, benevolence and tolerance, Li and his Falun Gong
cult have always been noted for their defiance of Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
Li, through brainwashing and spiritual control, has manipulated
a small number of Falun Gong practitioners who cling to his lies
and say they are motivated by his preaching.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Li and the core members of Falun Gong also claimed
that Falun Gong practitioners must follow the so-called Falun Dafa,
and that man-made laws have no bearing on their actions, the
official noted.
</P>
<P>
After being brainwashed, the ordinary Falun Gong practitioners
were ordered to challenge the country's laws, while Li's core
followers preferred to stay behind to pull their strings.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the official stressed that some Falun Gong
practitioners now residing abroad had come to China and shown
their disdain for the country's laws.
</P>
<P>
"Foreigners in China must abide by the country's law. Otherwise,
they will be punished," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official also refuted Li Hongzhi's false preaching, such as
his theories that "the earth will inevitably explode," "mankind
will eventually be exterminated," and "seriously ill people should
not take medicine."

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Income Key to Stability, National Economy: Lawmakers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Buhe and other senior Chinese
lawmakers said here today that the law should be used to protect
the legitimate rights and interests of the country's 800 million
farmers and increase their income.
</P>
<P>
"The increase of income is not only crucial to rural stability,
but also decisive for the sustainable growth of China's national
economy," said Buhe, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing an on-going national conference on
agricultural legislation.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the income of Chinese farmers has been
increasing by eight percent on a year-on-year basis, but due to
overproduction, price cuts of farm products and slow-down of rural
industrial development in recent years, the growth rate of rural
income has been decreasing.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of rural income slumped to 3.8 percent in 1999
from nine percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Liu Suinian, a celebrated economist and vice-chairman of the
NPC Committee of Agriculture and Rural Development, said that the
weak domestic demand is the most serious obstacle facing China's
current economic progress.
</P>
<P>
The proactive financial policy already taken by the government
is necessary, including the expanded scale of treasury bonds,
increase of payments to government employees and pensioners and
bank interests cuts, he said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Income Key to Stability, National Economy: Lawmakers (2) </HEADLINE>

<P>
"But their long-term effects are limited, and the cause of the
slack domestic demand lies in the poor purchase capability of two-
thirds of the country's population -- farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Buhe and Liu both called for efforts to speed up modernization
of rural areas to increase the level of urbanization in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Only 30 percent of the national population lives in towns and
cities; if the ratio could be enhanced to 50 percent in one or two
decades, another 200 million farmers will move to cities,
including a large number of small new towns," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"This tactic is feasible based on research and experiments," he
said.
</P>
<P>
This urbanization process will greatly increase the income of
farmers and help protect them from the influx of foreign farm
products after China joins the World Trade Organization, the
economist said.
</P>
<P>
According to Buhe, farmers' living conditions have been
worsened by the random fees and unreasonable fines levied by local
governments.
</P>
<P>
Formulating a law on protecting the rights and interests of
farmers has been listed in the work agenda of the top legislature
for the next three years, and other laws in the making concerning
agriculture should also focus on relieving farmers from
unreasonable economic burdens, the senior lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
"Social stability in the rural areas and sustainable economic
development of the nation rely on the well-being of the farmers,
and their interests should be our priority," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Events for Rolling Back Malaria Summit Kicked off in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 250 Nigerian school children
Tuesday gathered under a symbolic mosquito net in Nigeria's
capital Abuja as part of a new campaign to popularize the use of
treated nets to curb the growing scourge of malaria.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, marking the beginning of events for the
African summit to roll back malaria, was intended to demonstrate
the "possibility that malaria could be prevented, using cost
effective and simple methods such as insecticide treated bed
nets," the News Agency of Nigeria quoted officials of the World
Health Organization (WHO) as saying in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that the net, which is 225 times larger
than the conventional mosquito net would "served as a reminder
that 225 african children die of malaria every two and half hours
while over 2,173 children under the age of five die of malaria
every day."
</P>
<P>
The net which would enter the Guinness of records as the
largest of its type, would remain at the Eagle square, venue of
the country's May 29 hand- over, until the summit, expected to be
opened by President Olusegun Obasanjo on April 24.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's ceremony, Nigeria's first lady, Stella Obasanjo
said the demonstration "represents the beginning of a vigorous
and determined campaign to roll back malaria from our individual
countries."
</P>
<P>
Africa accounts for 90 percent of the worldwide Malaria
occurrence and Mrs Obasanjo said such measures would help end the
"payment of malaria tax" by millions of lives on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the net with immunization, she said "the efficacy and
benefits of insecticide treated bed nets have been well
established" and that the challenge was for those in endemic areas
to use it routinely.
</P>
<P>
The price of the nets, imported from abroad, varies between 450
naira (4. 5 U.S. dollars) for the cheapest to 7,500 naira (75
dollars) for the highest.

<P>
SEOUL, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A preparatory meeting for the inter-
Korean summit will be held Saturday at the truce village of
Panmunjom at 10 a.m. local time (0100GMT).
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang Wednesday informed Seoul of accepting its proposal on
the preparatory meeting for the summit which is scheduled for
Pyongyang on June 12-14.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK),
DPRK Red Cross President Jang Jae-on announced the acceptance to
his South Korean counterpart Chut Chung Won-shik by phone.
</P>
<P>
DPRK proposed to exchange letters to guarantee negotiation
delegations' safety at 9:30 a.m. Saturday through Red Cross
officials at Panmunjom, hoping that Seoul will accept the proposal.
</P>
<P>
If things go smoothly, inter-Korean government-level talks will
resume at the truce village six years after the preparatory
contact in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
South Korea Tuesday proposed that both Seoul and Pyongyang send
their five-member delegations led by vice minister-level officials
to attend the preparatory meeting.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, South Korea and DPRK reached an agreement in
China, under which South Korean President Kim Dae-jung will travel
to Pyongyang for a summit with DPRK leader Kim Jung-il.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first-ever inter-Korean summit since the Korean
War in the early 1950s.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Acquires HK Union Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC) has acquired a controlling stake of the Union
Bank of Hong Kong Ltd. at a price of 1.805 billion Hong Kong
dollars, according to a spokesman for the ICBC.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the ICBC signed an agreement today with
the Hong Kong Merchants (Holdings) Co. on the purchasing of over
239.9 million shares of the Union Bank which were previously held
by the Hong Kong Merchants (Holdings) Co.
</P>
<P>
The amount of shares involved in the acquisition accounts for
53.24 percent of the Union Bank's total equities. The purchasing
price is 7.52 Hong Kong dollars per share.
</P>
<P>
The Union Bank was founded in Hong Kong in 1964 and was listed
on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1973. By the end of 1999, the
bank had total assets of 21.4 billion Hong Kong dollars, with 22
local branches and one overseas branch.
</P>
<P>
ICBC President Jiang Jianqing said that the acquisition is of
great significance for the bank's business development, as it is
an important step in the bank's campaign to promote its
international business strategy and intensive development of the
Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the acquisition, the ICBC will draw on its
own advantages to give full support to the Union Bank in business
cooperation, capital raising, management and other aspects, aiming
to make the Union Bank a first-class listed bank in terms of
technology, business classification, profitability and management.
</P>
<P>
He said the ICBC will also draw on its scientific and
technological resources to help the Union Bank improve its
electronic banking functions, providing customers with stock
transactions, asset management, individual credit, on-line banking
and other services, and probe the possibility of connecting the
two banks' ATM and credit businesses.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC already has a branch and two subsidiaries in Hong Kong
engaged in whole-sale and investment banking businesses. After the
acquisition of the controlling stake of the Union Bank, the ICBC
will be able to use the Union Bank's advantages in retail banking
business to improve its own operations.

<P>
At a meeting with Janet K. Museveni, wife of Uganda President

will increase contacts and promote mutual understanding and
cooperation so as to make progress in both countries' women's
movement.

countries' women and people will further promote relations between
the two sides and to help women's causes in each country progress.

<HEADLINE> Company Develops New Handwriting Input System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Jinshan Company
has developed a WPS2000 handwriting input system, which will be
put into the market soon.
</P>
<P>
The software can help users input their handwritings, scripts
and even drawings, according to the Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the company said that the input technology of the
company follows the principle of "whole sentences and whole
phrases". This enables the computer to recognize more illegible
handwriting.
</P>
<P>
Jinshan Company developed a Chinese-English and English-Chinese
computer dictionary a couple of years ago, which is now widely
used in China. And the handwriting input system will be another
major product of the company.
</P>
<P>
The market potential of the non-keyboard Chinese input is very
big. In Hong Kong, the market share of handwriting input is one-
third of keyboard input, while in the Chinese interior area, the
proportion is one to 100.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pay More for Hospital Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Statistics of the Ministry of
Health (MOH) show that the Chinese are paying more for hospital
service, mainly because of higher medicine prices.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese now pays an average 79 yuan (about 9.5 US dollars)
per hospital outpatient visit and 2,891 yuan (about 348 US dollars)
for each hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
The costs are respectively 10 yuan and 300 yuan higher than the
figures one year ago, and the price hike has led to a successive
increase in medical expenditure in China.
</P>
<P>
Drug costs were found to make up 60 percent of the total
outpatient fee and 47 percent of the hospital admission fee,
becoming the leading cause of the expenditure increase.
</P>
<P>
In fact, rapid growth of drug prices in recent years has
brought steady complaints from those who can't afford the
treatment, as well as an outcry for medi-care reform to curb the
rise of medical costs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is fashioning a medical insurance system
to cover hundreds of millions of urban workers, mainly aiming to
slow down the cost growth.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals will be forced to gradually eliminate highly
profitable drug sectors and turn them into tax-paying drugstores
to prevent doctors from prescribing expensive medicine to get
sales commissions.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that medical expenses differed at
different hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Several hospitals affiliated with MOH, ranked among China's
best hospitals, charge all patients 163 yuan in outpatient fees
and 7,961 yuan for the hospitalization fee, compared with 49 yuan
and 1,508 yuan at an ordinary county-level hospital.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A kidnapping ring which abducted
84 women and children and forced them to provide sexual services
has been destroyed, the Ministry of Public Security confirmed
today.
</P>
<P>
A police investigation revealed that since 1997, Wang Heqiao, a
female farmer in Zunyi County, southwest China's Guizhou Province,
has collaborated with a dozen of her family members in abducting
84 women in Zunyi County.
</P>
<P>
Of those, 51 were single and more than 30 were under the age of
17. The women were kidnapped and sold as prostitutes to eight
beauty salons in Zhangzhou City, in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Saying they were bringing the group to the area to work, the
kidnappers provided all traveling fees between Zunyi and Zhangzhou
for the 84 women, but stripped them of their identification cards
and all personal belongings after reaching the destination. Those
who refused to provide sexual services were starved and beaten.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Refutes Annette Lu's Description of Cross-Straits Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today
published yet another commentary condemning the pro-independence
remarks made recently by Annette Lu, a member of the Taiwan-based
Democratic Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
The commentary is titled "Lu's description of cross-Straits
relations as being that of distant relatives and close neighbors
is clearly a denial of the one-China principle."
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui, who was just defeated in local elections in the
Taiwan region, has repeatedly come out with ridiculous analogies
to sum up the cross-Straits ties, calling them "special state-to-
state relations" and saying "the Republic of China is located in
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Lu has outdone Lee in this regard, consistently trying to make
distinctions between Taiwan and China, and the Taiwanese and
Chinese. She has foolishly claimed that "Taiwan's sovereignty is
independent and nobody can deny it."
</P>
<P>
Lu, who has been dangerously liberal in her attempts to
separate Taiwan from China, is ignoring history and public opinion.
She has been exposed to the world as a strident champion of "
Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
However, Lu cannot deny the blood ties between the compatriots
who live on both sides of the Straits and the fact that Taiwan has
been part of China since ancient times.

<TEXT>
<P>
The entire Chinese nation has strongly opposed the stubborn "
Taiwan independence" stance taken by Lu and Lee. Lu even cooked up
the absurd theory that the fall of the Kuomintang cleared the way
for "Taiwan independence," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan independence" elements -- like Lu -- ignores logic and
historical fact in its desire to split China.
</P>
<P>
Lee and Lu, though they wear different disguises and adopt
different means to challenge the one-China principle, are both
working toward the same goal to divide China, it says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary goes on to explain why separatists fear and
loathe the one-China principle, saying that their dream of "Taiwan
independence" can never come true and the separatists will come to
no good end.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui has tried time and again to wipe out the
Kuomintang because the party used to recognize the fact that there
is only one China.
</P>
<P>
Annette Lu, who believes that the mainland could not afford a
war, has followed in Lee's footsteps to gamble with the interests
of 23 million Taiwan people by openly advocating "Taiwan
independence," the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Saying she has shamelessly betrayed her motherland for wealth
and power, the commentary warns Lu that she has figured wrong on
China's position.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the one-China principle is the basis for the
peaceful reunification of the motherland and the smooth
development of the cross-Straits relations principle.

<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have found that
MDMA, a type of amphetamine, has made its way into a number of
Chinese discos, the Ministry of Public Security confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
MDMA is no longer a strange sight to young people in the discos
of Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as it was
in 1997 when Chinese police cracked the country's first MDMA case
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Cunyi, deputy director of the Narcotics
Control Bureau under the Ministry of Public Security, MDMA is an
addictive substance which stimulates the nervous system, causing
drug-users to become easily excited and often to act violently.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that drugs have had a powerfully negative impact
on Chinese society, and the situation has attracted the attention
of both senior government officials and ordinary citizens.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Fires Katyusha Rockets at Israeli Positions Along Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah guerrillas Wednesday
morning fired 11 Katyusha rockets at Israeli positions in south
Lebanon near the international borders of Israel and Lebanon,
People's Sound radio reported.
</P>
<P>
According to security sources, the attacks were focused on the
position of Tayel Harfaa in the western sector of south Lebanon and
Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for the raids.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the attacks caused any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak vowed Wednesday that his
country will retaliate if Hezbollah guerrillas continue firing
Katyushas to northern Israel or cause any casualties after its
troop withdrawal from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the Israeli cabinet decided to endorse
Barak's pledge to bring the Israeli soldiers back home from south
Lebanon by July, with or without a peace agreement with Lebanon and
its main power broker Syria.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Israel formally notified the United Nations that it
will go ahead with the planned withdrawal by July.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
a self-styled security zone there in 1985 with a claimed aim of
protecting its northern borders from cross-border guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, backed by Iran and Syria, has since
been engaged in a war of attrition to try to oust Israeli troops
and their ally South Lebanon Army from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Repeats Rejection to U.N. Resolution 1284 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan has stressed that Iraq will never implement the U.N.
Security Council Resolution 1284 because it failed to respond to
Iraq's demand for a total lifting of the decade-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, as a product of the British colonialist
mentality designed to put Iraq under its mandate, transferred Iraq
from conditional sanctions to everlasting embargo, Ramadan was
quoted as saying by the Iraqi News Agency (INA) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not pin hope on the U.N. Security Council to lift the
sanctions, but will let the embargo get eroded by itself, said
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan is among the senior Iraqi officials who have recently
rejected the U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz rejected
the U.N. Security Council decision to approve a new arms inspection
plan for Iraq, and reiterated Iraq's refusal to the Resolution
1284.
</P>
<P>
"I have never hinted that Iraq will cooperate with this
resolution," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which created the U.N. Monitoring, Verification
and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) for Iraq, aims at resuming U.N.
arms inspections on Iraq, suspended since December 1998 when the U.
S. and Britain launched the Operation Desert Fox air strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has since barred the U.N. arms inspectors from going back
and insisted that a total lifting of sanctions is the precondition
for their return.
</P>
<P>
The resolution offers to suspend sanctions for renewable 120-day
periods if U.N. arms inspectors report that Iraq has cooperated "in
all respects" with them and shown progress towards answering their
outstanding questions about its disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions cannot be lifted until the U.N.
Security Council certifies that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia welcomes the
proposal to hold a summit between leaders of South Korea and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in Pyongynag on June

</P>
<P>
"We view the summit as indeed historic in terms of inter-Korean

It has been Malaysia's long standing position that differences
between S. Korea and the DPRK be resolved through peaceful
dialogue and that positive measures be taken by both sides in
developing a conducive atmosphere for the establishment of
permanent peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>

and the world at large," Syed Hamid said.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to Undergo Further Medical Treatment Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Within two days from now on, Mr. Soeharto is due to undergo
further medical treatment to make sure that he is healthy enough
or not to face further questioning," Juan Felix Tampubolon, one of
Soeharto's lawyers told reporters after accompanying Bambang
Trihatmodjo,Soeharto's second son when the latter underwent
investigation as a witness in corruption cases allegedly involved
his father, at the Attorney General Office (AGO).
</P>
<P>
Up till now, the AGO has not collected comprehensive
information from Soeharto to confirm whether the former strong man
has committed abuse of power and piled up fortune illegally during
his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
The medical team declared Soeharto is unfit to face
investigation saying the 78-years old man blood pressure arised
surpassing a"tolerable border."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Trihatmodjo, who was questioned by the AGO for
about 6 hours Wednesday, gave no comments on the investigation
process.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the AGO also summoned Soeharto's eldest daughter
Siti Hardiyanti Indrarukmana for the same cases.
</P>
<P>
The AGO has insisted that it will hammer out to disclose
corruption case allegedly involved the former New Order ruler.
</P>
<P>
It has put the former strong man under city arrest and banned
him from leaving the country.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for Immediate Action to Save Millions in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 19 (Xinhua) --The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has said that immediate action is crucial to save
the lives of millions of children and women in the Horn of Africa,
noting that no time can be lost to red tape or political inaction.
</P>
<P>
A UNICEF press release available here on Wednesday said that
UNICEF's offices in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Kenya and
Somalia, which are most directly threatened by the drought, are
focusing their relief efforts in the areas of health, nutrition,
water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
Rodney Phillips, UNICEF's senior program officer in Ethiopia
said that " food is essential absolutely, but food alone is not
sufficient to prevent death."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "without clean water to drink, disease can
easily claim lives; without proper health care, diseases can
spread unchecked."
</P>
<P>
According to the release, UNICEF has airlifted relief supplies
into the southern regions of Ethiopia, including several tons of
high protein biscuits for children and pregnant women, water cans
for family use, and oral re-hydration salts.
</P>
<P>
The biscuits are particularly valuable because they are ready
to eat and require no preparation or searching for wood and water,
UNICEF noted.
</P>
<P>
Education is also suffering from the drought as children leave
school to help support family incomes. In the Gode region, some
600 kilometers southeast of Addis Ababa, more than one third of
primary schools have shut their doors.

<HEADLINE> Conservationists Campaign to Protect Great Sharks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 19 (xinhua) -- Leading international
environmental groups including the International Fund for Animal
Welfare and the Center for Marine Conservation have made appeals
for protection of the world's large sharks, said a news release
available here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The environmental groups called on the delegates attending the
ongoing 11th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi to support the proposals raised by Britain, the
United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Britain and the U.S. proposed to list the
basking shark and the whale shark on the CITES Appendix II which
regulates trade under a strict monitoring system based on a permit
process.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Australia also proposed to uplist the
great white shark to the Appendix I which bans all trade.
</P>
<P>
The three large shark species have been the target of a rapidly
growing shark fin trade, causing widespread international concern
on the biological vulnerability, the groups said.
</P>
<P>
"Basking, great white and whale sharks, like most sharks, grow
slowly, mature late and produce few offspring," said Sonja
Fordham, shark specialist for the Center for Marine Conservation.
</P>
<P>
"These characteristics leave sharks exceptionally vulnerable to
over exploitation and slow to recover from depletion," Fordham
said.
</P>
<P>
It is said that a single fin from a basking or whale shark can
sell for up to 15,000 U.S. dollars in Asia and the jaw of a large
great white shark can sell for up to 50,000 U.S. dollars in the
United States and Europe for trophy collectors.
</P>
<P>
CITES is the only effective mechanism for monitoring and
controlling trade in shark parts, said Sarah Tyack, international
endangered species coordinator with the International Fund for
Animal Welfare.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Putin Visit Sheds Light on Russian Foreign Policy Orientation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-elect Vladimir
Putin returned to Moscow early Wednesday after a three-day working
visit to Belarus, Britain and Ukraine, a visit that showed
Moscow's foreign policy priorities on ties with the CIS countries
and the West.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which groups 12
former Soviet republics, is Russia's backyard and strengthening
relations with fellow CIS member states has all along been a top
priority in Russian foreign policy. It is only too natural that
Belarus and Ukraine, two major CIS members, were put on the list
of Putin's first foreign trip after winning the March 26
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the least critical among Western countries of
Russia's military campaign in its breakaway republic of Chechnya
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, during a recent visit to
Putin's native St. Petersburg, expressed London's willingness to
cooperate with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
For a Russia that is now keen to improve and develop relations
with the West, it is sensible for Putin to choose Britain as the
first Western country to visit.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is Russia's most staunch ally inside the CIS. A treaty
on a union state between Russia and Belarus went into force on
January 26, marking the start of the establishment of their union.
Although the two neighbors still have to work out a unified system
of currency, taxation, the customs, border control, defense and
nationality of their residents, Putin's visit would boost the
progress of the two country's integration.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Minsk, Belarus' capital, Putin and
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko discussed bilateral
ties and the implementation of the union treaty, reaching broad
agreement on cooperation in defense, military technology and
economy, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Most observers see London as the most important leg of Putin's
three-nation tour. As a major Western country, Britain enjoys
close relations with the United States. At a time when France and
Germany distance themselves from Moscow over Chechnya,
strengthening ties with London is of "special significance" to
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Both Putin and Blair expressed satisfaction with the outcome of
their talks, which touched bilateral ties, Russian economy and
Chechnya. Britain said Putin's London visit represents the
establishment of brand-new strategic relations between the two
countries. The Russian side described Putin's trip as a "key step
forward" in its effort to improve its ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is also one of Russia's strategic partners, but their
ties were marred by many problems in the energy and industrial
sectors. Against the background of intensified efforts by the West
to draw Ukraine closer to its lot, Putin's trip became all the
more important.
</P>
<P>
According to Russian media reports, Ukraine owes Gazprom,
Russia's state-owned natural gas monopoly, 2.1 billion U.S.
dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
Following their talks, Putin and Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma told reporters that the two countries could, through joint
efforts, solve the problems hindering bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, on his part, said their strategic partnership
determines that the two countries would have fruitful
collaboration in political and economic fields, despite the
outstanding problems.
</P>
<P>
Russia's new foreign policy concept has not been made public
yet, but in his election platform, Putin said he would formulate
foreign policy from the standpoint of national interests.
</P>
<P>
Putin's latest visit and the State Duma's recent ratification
of the long-delayed START II nuclear arms reduction treaty with
the United States offered one a glimpse on Russia's foreign policy
orientation.
</P>
<P>
They indicate that Russia's top foreign policy priorities would
include improving and developing ties with and seeking economic
assistance from the West, repairing and strengthening ties with
other CIS countries to safeguard Russia's "vital interests" in the
so-called near abroad.

<HEADLINE> Russian Upper House Approves Firing of Prosecutor General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's upper house of parliament
on Wednesday approved the sacking of suspended Prosecutor General
Yuri Skuratov in another victory for President-elect Vladimir
Putin.
</P>
<P>
The Federation Council voted 133-10 with six abstentions to
confirm Skuratov's dismissal, which was tabled by former president
Boris Yeltsin and rejected three times last year by the upper
house.
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Putin sent a letter to the assembly, urging
the lawmakers to approve the sacking.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov, during his appearance before the senators, said he
would not step down voluntarily, as this would be a concession to
those who have been insisting on his dismissal, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the situation surrounding the
election of a new Russian president "objectively demands" that he
leave his post. He called on the upper house to support the
nomination of "a politically disengaged, decent and professional
person" for the post of prosecutor general.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin tried to sack Skuratov following revelations of his
alleged involvement with prostitutes, but Russian media said then
that the firing was related to Skuratov's attempts to probe high-
level corruption.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov had said he would make sensational disclosures about
official corruption but never did. He ran in the presidential race
and garnered less than 1 percent of the votes in the March 26
elections.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Int'l Fair for Medium, Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China will hold an international
fair for medium-sized and small enterprises in September,
organizers announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Through this event, China's medium-sized and small enterprises
may gain a better understanding of the technological level of
their counterparts abroad. The fair will also give both sides a
chance to expand technological, economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The China International Commodities Fair will be held in the
city of Changzhou in eastern Jiangsu Province from September 20-24,
organizers said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The fair will be sponsored by the State Economic and Trade
Commission, China Council for the Promotion of International Trade,
and the Jiangsu provincial government. Support will be lent by the
World Assembly of Small and Medium Enterprises, and the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Qiangui, deputy director of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said at today's press conference that medium-sized and
small enterprises play an increasingly important role in China's
national economy.
</P>
<P>
At present, their industrial output value, pre-tax profits and
exports account for 60 percent, 40 percent and 60 percent of the
country's total, respectively. Meanwhile, they provide 75 percent
of the new jobs in cities and towns, she said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than eight million medium-sized and small
enterprises, accounting for 99 percent of the country's total
businesses, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Changzhou, located on the south of the Yangtze River at the
lower reaches, has a history of more than 2,500 years. It has
modern industries famous for the production of diesel engines,
speed trains, buses, new-type building materials and blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
Changzhou's deputy mayor Yang Dawei predicted that more than
100 firms from 30 countries and regions, as well as 20,000
visitors, will attend the fair.
</P>
<P>
During the fair, participants will be able to have trade talks,
transfer high technological items, and order goods. Organizers
will also hold a seminar on opportunities and challenges facing
China's medium-sized and small enterprises that will arise
following the country's expected entry into the World Trade
Organization.

<HEADLINE> New Water Treatment Plant Opens in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
has formally opened a new water treatment plant in the island's
southern coast, the local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tersephanou Water Treatment Plant is part of the second
phase of the Southern Conveyor Project, the largest and most
ambitious water development project ever undertaken in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony Tuesday, Clerides pointed
to the grave problem of water shortage faced by Cyprus, stressing
the importance and need of desalination plants.
</P>
<P>
The new facility actually began operating last December after a
two-month trial run. It can treat 60,000 cubic metres of water a
day and can raise the output to 90,000 cubic meters soon.
</P>
<P>
The plant is an integral part of the Southern Conveyor Project,
which starts at the Kouris Dam in the south and feeds water to
towns along its route to its terminus in Nicosia, the capital.
</P>
<P>
The European Investment Bank and the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development granted loans totalling 60 percent of the
total cost of the project, which is about 20 million Cyprus pounds
(40 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
With reservoirs in Cyprus 85 percent empty now, and the winter
brought only 61 percent of a "normal" meteorological year's
rainfall, the island remains locked in drought, now for a fifth
straight year, and would thus grow ever more dependent on
desalination plants.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Indonesia to Speed-up Legal Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF)Wednesday urged the Indonesian government to speed-up legal
reforms process to boost the on-going economic recovery program.
</P>
<P>
It also said that this weekend an IMF technical team would
arrive here to review the implementation of the reforms points
contained in the letter of intent (LoI) before it resume the next
aid package worth 400 million U.S. dollars to the country.
</P>
<P>
"There are points which will influence the on-going economic
recovery program. Firstly, restructuring of banking and debt,
secondly, privatization program, and third is legal reforms," IMF
Senior Representatives in Jakarta John Dodsworth said when
addressing a conference on Indonesian Debt Restructuring and Asset
Sales.
</P>
<P>
Corporate and debt restructuring program will not be successful
without legal reforms, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Because now, (in Indonesia) no one trust the public
institution,including court institution," Dodsworth said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Indonesian Banking Restructuring Agency (IBRA)
, a body under the Finance Ministry, not to concern only with
corporate and debt restructuring and sales asset but also "concern
with how to create healthy banking system."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Indonesian government should take
immediate measures to curb rampant corruption practices "directly
or indirectly and bringing those it finds guilty to the court."
</P>
<P>
Last month, the IMF delayed to disburse its loan package worth
400 million U.S. dollars due to failure of the Indonesian
government in implementing reforms programs as scheduled by both
sides, the IMF and the government, in April.
</P>
<P>
But later, the IMF was optimistic the Indonesian government
would be able to settle the programs.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Worked Out New Rules for Tea Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Tea brokers and buyers in Kenya
will have to register with the Tea Board of Kenya and their
management agents will also be required to register, Agriculture
Minister Chris Obure has said.
</P>
<P>
Obure made the remarks recently when he met with the
stakeholders in the tea industry, saying that the Tea Board of
Kenya will continue to monitor exports through the registration,
the East African Standard newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He explained the the requirements for registration of exports
would be for statistical and planning purposes, adding that with
these changes, there will be no cess levied on tea farms.
</P>
<P>
On tea trade, Obure said, tea packers were required to register
with the tea board and file monthly returns.
</P>
<P>
He noted that when the state-owned Kenya Tea Development
Authority is transformed into an agency, there will be less
government control in its management, saying the transformation
would empower tea farmers in the management, production,
processing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The government expected that by July this year, the reforms in
the tea industry would make tea growers manage the sector
themselves, thus making the sector more vibrant for offering more
job opportunities and generating more foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of major black tea producers in the world. Last
year, it exported 246,000 tons of tea to some 40 countries and
regions.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Police Search for Armed Somali Bandits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian paramilitary
police are searching for about 12 Somali bandits hiding in forests
in the northern Ngorongoro District following their attacks on
Tanzanian villagers last Sunday, which left two people dead and
several others injured.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Wednesday quoted Arusha Regional
Commissioner Daniel ole Njoolay as saying that the government has
sent reinforcements in the area.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to disclose the number of forces deployed in the area,
the commissioner stressed that the government will ensure that the
Somali bandits be tracked down and brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
The armed bandits attacked a vehicle travelling from Sonjo
Village to Wasco Village for a cattle auction on Sunday morning.
An old man in the car was hit by a stray bullet and died
instantly. Other passengers in the vehicle scattered in the bush
to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
The bandits hijacked the driver and took him deep inside the
bush where the police later discovered his body with bullet
wounds. The Somalis robbed his money but abandoned the car.
</P>
<P>
For more than two years, the Somali bandits have been launching
attacks on villages in Ngorongoro and Monduli districts by
crossing the border from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The attacks, which seem to have baffled the police completely,
have resulted in the deaths of scores of innocent Tanzanians and
the pillage of cash and property.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Refutes Tokyo Governor's Offensive Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) lashed out at Tokyo metropolitan governor
Shintaro Ishihara for his recent strongly offensive remarks on
foreigners including the Koreans.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the official news agency,
said in a report Wednesday that Ishihara's remarks about "a
possible riot by foreigners in Tokyo" are "an open challenge to
the public in Japan and abroad."
</P>
<P>
Ishihara said on April 9 when meeting with Yoshinobu Ishii of
the Komeito party in Tokyo that "Japan can expect 'Sangokujin' and
other foreigners to riot in the event of a disastrous earthquake."
</P>
<P>
"Sangokujin" is an abusive Japanese word that literally means
people from foreign countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
It is a disgrace that "such a mentally deranged politician as
Ishihara stays in the Japanese political circles," the KCNA stated,
adding "Ishihara, who is swimming against the trend of the times,
is bound to face a stern judgment by the unbiased public."
</P>
<P>
Ishihara has drawn an angry chorus of public criticism at home
and abroad, the Asian nations in particular.

index failed to regain levels seen last week.

<HEADLINE> Scholar Suggests Accelerated Urbanization in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Tibetologist said today
that urbanization should be accelerated on the roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Li Tao, a sociologist with the Sichuan-based Tibet Studies
Institute, points out that urbanization is a worldwide trend that
can greatly push an economy, and it will help the Tibet Autonomous
Region narrow the gap between itself the prosperous coastal region.
</P>
<P>
Li denounced the allegations made by some people that Tibet is
a "special region" which should maintain its old image as a "
living fossil," and that a modernization drive will damage
traditional culture and violate human rights there.
</P>
<P>
In many visitors' eyes, Tibet is a mysterious and unchanged
land with endless snowy mountains and thousands of lamaseries.
</P>
<P>
However, after years of field investigations, Li notes that in
the globalization process, maintaining a primitive and isolated
lifestyle is not the proper choice for the Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
"Many case studies have shown that the living standard of poor
villagers improved greatly thanks to factories and markets in
nearby cities, and they have obtained more access to medical care,
schools and other social services," she said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations also show that the majority of Tibetans prefer a
city life. Li said that the strategic decision to develop western
China will put Tibet on the track toward urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Her new book, "Say Farewell to Gyabala: a Study of Tibetan
Urbanization," was published by the Tibet People's Publishing
House today.
</P>
<P>
The book reveals that Tibetans are happy to see talented people,
technologies and funds flowing in from other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
However, Li points out that Tibet's urbanization will differ
from the coastal model, because the vast region has fewer people,
and thus Tibet's traditional culture and religion will be
protected during the process.
</P>
<P>
Professor G.E.Guldin of the United States said the book is the
first of its kind on Tibetan urbanization, and will have a
positive influence on urbanization theory and practice worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Business Tops Guangdong's Crusade to West (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Governor Lu Ruihua of Guangdong
Province was overjoyed when his delegation of 1,000 businesspeople
concluded more than 100 deals at the Investment and Trade Fair for
Cooperation between East and West China held in Xi'an, capital of
Shaanxi Province, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu, his province's local enterprises are also
eager to attend other trade fairs in western China, including the
China Coastal Enterprises Commodity Fair and Investment Trade
Talks scheduled for Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, in May, and the investment and trade fair to be held in
Chongqing in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Lu said that the state policy to spur the economic
development of the vast western region has not only brought "
historical opportunities" for the region, but also new
opportunities for developed eastern area.
</P>
<P>
Western China including nine provinces and autonomous regions
and one municipality, with a total area of 5.4 million square
kilometers and a population of 285 million, accounts for 56
percent and 23 percent, respectively, of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Less-developed western China has abundant water, minerals,
natural gas, and biological resources, and a large market
consisting of one-quarter of China's consumers.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's develop-the-west strategy, a great number
of projects will be built there, and this will mean huge
investment opportunities. These include the planned construction
of eight highways at a cost of 120 billion yuan (about 14.46
billion U.S. dollars).

During the tenth Five-Year-Plan period (2001-2005), investment
in major railway infrastructure projects in western China alone
will hit 100 billion yuan (12 billion U.S. dollars) and by the
year of 2005, the total length of railway in the west will reach
one million km.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the country's investment in forestry and
ecological construction in the western region will exceed 200
billion yuan (about 24.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China's two decades of reform and opening-up
has turned this southern province of Guangdong into an important
economic powerhouse with one-tenth of the country's gross economic
value.
</P>
<P>
However, the province has been plagued by overproduction for
the past several years, and is now actively helping residents from
the poor areas of western China. It has donated over one billion
yuan (120 million U.S. dollars ) in cash and in kind areas in
Guizhou Province, Chongqing Municipality, and the Guangxi Zhuang
and Tibet autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
It has also earmarked special funds to finance construction of
public welfare projects, relocate people from harsh environments
to places with better living conditions, help people from poor
areas become prosperous by starting development projects, as to
train administrative officials and build more than 191 Project
Hope schools in poor areas of western China.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Sets Key Sectors for Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province will further open some key sectors to encourage foreign
investment in a move to stimulate competition and to assist the
development of west China.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Governor Zhang Zhongwei said the province will open
wider to overseas investment in areas of information technology,
tourism, environment protection, tourism and service in addition
to agriculture development, machinery and electronics, building
materials and decoration industries.
</P>

Zhang said that apart from running joint ventures and solely
foreign-funded enterprises, foreign businessmen can adopt new
approaches for investment such as share-holding, BOT,
incorporating and purchasing, franchises, and issuing bonds abroad.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sichuan has formulated a series of regulations to
encourage foreign enterprises to do business in the province and
to protect their legal rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The province also set up service centers and a complaint center
for foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999 Sichuan had 5,188 foreign-funded enterprises
contracted foreign investment of 13.2 billion U.S. dollars and

<HEADLINE> Belgium-funded Project Launched in Shaanxi Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A project funded by the Belgian
Government aiming to help poverty-stricken people in northwest
China's Shaanxi Province has been launched recently.
</P>
<P>
The project, covering water supply in rural areas, development
concerning women, cultivation of fruit trees and rural sanitation,
will be carried out in three prefectures and cities and six
counties including Jingbian, Zhidan, Yanchuan, Ansai, Wuqi and
Sanyuan in the province.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Government provided 300 million Belgian francs (about 7
million U.S. dollars) and the Chinese side allocated 73.5 million
yuan (8.86 million U.S. dollars) in counterpart funding for the
project, so far the largest joint program regarding helping the
poor between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached an agreement on the project in February
1999.
</P>
<P>
Andre Sevais, a Belgian representative for the project, visited
Shaanxi recently, saying that the Belgian Government is much
concerned with the project.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rare Ancient Coins Collected in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHUAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 80,000 1,900-year-old
coins dating back to the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD) have been
collected by the Museum of Xiji County in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that the coins were minted with two Chinese
characters "huo" and "quan", which are the first of their kind
ever discovered.
</P>
<P>
The coins were cast during the reign of Wang Mang, a former
minister of the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-24 AD) who founded the
short-term Xin Dynasty (8-23) before the Eastern Han Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
During the period, knife-shaped and spade-shaped coins were
circulated, but the most popular were round coins with inscription
of "huo" and "quan".
</P>
<P>
The "huo" and "quan" coins were unearthed in Ningxia's
neighboring Gansu Province. The total weight is about 310
kilograms and each coin is 2.3 cm in diameter, 0.07 cm in
thickness and three grams in weight.
</P>
<P>
The hoarded coins had not been put into circulation, according
to the archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
The coins will provide valuable clues for study on the currency
system in the reign of Wang Mang and development history of
ancient Chinese coins.

He believes that Guangdong has an edge over western China in
its concepts, capital, management expertise and export market, but
lacks the vast resources of western China such as land, labor,
minerals, forests, and hydropower.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Guangdong's economic structure is dominated by
light processing industries, while western China is concentrated
on heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of a complementary and profit-sharing
system between Guangdong and the western region, coupled with the
government's preferential treatment policies and information and
technological services, cooperation can be everlasting, bringing
about common development and prosperity for both partners, said
the official.
</P>
<P>
"Our crusade to the west should not simply be the shipment of
commodities. Rather, we should improve Guangdong's talent and
economic structure, and realize faster industrial upgrading by
participating in the national campaign to develop western China
for common prosperity between the east and the west," Wu explained.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Cyprus Buys Interbank of New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Cyprus has announced a
preliminary agreement for the acquisition of Interbank of New York,
a U.S.-registered bank for a consideration of approximately 43
million U.S. dollars, local media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition is believed to be a strategic move and part of
the Bank of Cyprus Group's broader policy to expand to overseas
markets where a significant Greek community lives.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations with Interbank started last Friday and the deal was
clinched on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Interbank, set up in 1990, provides services mainly to the Greek
and Cypriot community in New York and has four branches and 52
employees.
</P>
<P>
Its total assets amount to 173 million dollars, customer
deposits 156 million dollars, and total advances 115 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Interbank is in accordance with the Bank of
Cyprus Group's policy for the effective utilization of the new
capital which will be raised through a public offering in Greece
for the listing of the Bank of Cyprus shares on the Athens Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Usually relying on its own resources to build a presence
overseas, this is only the second time in the 100-year history of
the Bank of Cyprus that it has acquired another bank. It took over
the Cyprus activities of Standard Chartered Bank in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is contingent on approval from the Central Bank of
Cyprus and the U.S. authorities.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli Security Cabinet decided Tuesday not to challenge
the Supreme Court's decision to release 13 Lebanese hostages being
held in Israel as "bargaining chips" for the return of missing
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, the release, scheduled for Wednesday, will be delayed
until the court considers a petition against the release submitted
by the family of missing Israel Air Force navigator Ron Arad
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The security cabinet is resolved to concentrate its efforts on
speedily moving to ensure that two other, more prominent detainees,
Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid of Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas and
Mustafa Dirani of Amal militia, not be allowed to go free.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Katyusha rocket fire struck a settlement in the Western
Galilee Tuesday afternoon. The rockets damaged an electricity
transformer, causing a blackout in the region for several hours.
Two women were treated after complaining of illness as a result of
the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Though the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Northern Command did not
ask local residents to take cover in bomb shelters, officers
estimated Tuesday that the Katyusha attack against Israeli
civilians was deliberate and categorized it as being "very grave."
</P>
<P>
The strike came at the peak of a day of heavy skirmishing in
southern Lebanon that left one Syrian construction worker dead and
five people injured, including two IDF soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The horde of Israeli fans that have descended on Salonika,
Greece exulted in victory Tuesday night after Israel's Maccabi Tel
Aviv crushed Barcelona of Spain by 65-51 to move into the European
Champions League basketball final.
</P>
<P>
The victory is the first time in 11 years. If Maccabi Tel Aviv
defeats another finalist Panathinaikos of Greece in the final on
Thursday night, they will kiss the championship cup for the first
time since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Israelis came without tickets and had to watch the
game on large screen TV in pubs along the city's boardwalk. Others
managed to buy tickets from Spaniards and Greeks for as much as 1,
500 U.S. dollars apiece.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad wants a resumption of peace
talks as soon as possible and has a genuine desire for peace,
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The president has told me that he wanted peace talks to resume
as soon as possible," said Chretien, who met with Assad for 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at the Damascus airport before leaving for
Saudi Arabia that he was impressed by the Syrian president's desire
and commitment to peace.

from 5.75 percent to 6 percent as part of a series of moves
designed to stop inflation spreading.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark rate determines the cost of borrowing and
influences returns on deposits.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement, Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash said the
New Zealand economy has now been growing robustly for almost two
years and the risks of rising inflation are gradually increasing.
</P>
<P>
"Firmer monitory conditions will be needed if we are to give
ourselves the best chance of solid growth continuing without
inflation problems emerging," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Brash raised the OCR regardless of acting Prime Minister Jim
Anderton publicly pleading with him not to do so.
</P>
<P>
Anderton warned that when interest rates rise, exchange rates
rise."That makes for weaker competitiveness in the export sector
which discourages exporters and encourages importing. And that of
course just exacerbates the balance of payments deficit."
</P>
<P>
Anderton hoped that Brash would "leave interest rates unchanged
".
</P>
<P>
But under the Reserve Bank Act of New Zealand, the interest
rate is a matter of the Governor's judgment and the Governor is
accountable for it in terms of the consequences that follow.
</P>
<P>
Brash has been gradually tightening the screws on the economy
over the past six months. He raised the OCR in November, January
and March.

According to the envoy, "President Obasanjo is concerned that
there should be communication between the British government and
the Zimbabwean government... He felt that he will be able to
broker a meeting between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will soon send a high-powered delegation to London for
talks with the British government on the land issue.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean White Farmers Eye Zambia for Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Some white farmers in neighboring
Zimbabwe are eyeing Zambia for investment and have started making
inquiries about the land policy of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Wednesday quoted President of
Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) Ajay Vashee as saying here on
Tuesday that the inquiries include the market policy.
</P>
<P>
According to Vashee, his union will welcome good farmers from
Zimbabwe who are going to invest in the country but not those who
will only want to run away from paying back loans.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean farmers have been told about Zambia's
liberalized market and present government-respected title to land,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vashee urged the Zimbabwean government to resolve
the conflict over land, saying it will affect investor confidence
in southern African region if the situation is allowed to
continue.
</P>
<P>
Most investors outside Africa would avoid the region because
they do not know that Zimbabwe is just a country in southern
Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no pressures on land in Zambia. We will welcome good
Zimbabwean white farmers who wish to invest in Zambia. We have
good land and marketing policies here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Tuesday said that
his government was determined to resolve the land issue once and
for all.
</P>
<P>
In his national address to mark 20 years of independence,
Mugabe said he could understand the frustration of the war
veterans and the pressures faced by white commercial farmers in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will soon send a high-powered delegation to London for
talks with the British government on the land issue.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 white-owned farms have so far been occupied by war
veterans since they launched the invasion almost two months ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has addressed the political and
commercial risk associated with Africa in the Free Trade Area
(FTA) by endorsing the establishment of the African Trade
Insurance Agency.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made at the just-ended fourth meeting of the
COMESA committee on legal affairs held in Lusaka to increase the
availability of financial resources for investments and other
productive activities, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to reduce the cost of trade finance in Africa by
mitigating the political and commercial risks associated with the
continent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to COMESA Clearing House consultant Mahmood Mansoor,
seven COMESA members, namely, Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda,
Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia, endorsed the agency while Zimbabwe
and Mozambique are still deciding on whether or not to join the
scheme.
</P>
<P>
The scheme has been implemented and supported by the World
Bank, which will be providing the International Development
Association eligible states with soft loans, Mansoor said.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme, which will be in effect within a year of
the operation of the FTA, is to facilitate, encourage and develop
the provision of insurance and reinsurance, and other financial
instruments and services for the purpose of trade and other
productive activities in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Seed Potato Shortage Looms in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A shortage of seed potato is
looming in Zambia following a recent export ban by South Africa,
said Zambia National Union of Farmers (ZNFU) president Ajay Vashee
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Department of Agriculture slapped a ban on
exports of both potatoes and seed to countries in the region
because of the recent outbreak of potato nematodes disease in that
country, Vashee said in an interview in Ndola in Copperbelt
Province.
</P>
<P>
As a result, there has been no further exports to Zambia
recently, he was quoted by Wednesday's Times of Zambia newspaper
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Zambia will likely face a serious shortage of both potatoes
and seed in the next few months until the disease in that country
is brought under control," Vashee warned.
</P>
<P>
He commended the move by South Africa as timely because the
disease would otherwise have been imported into Zambia, posing a
serious threat to local potato farmers.
</P>
<P>
Imported crop diseases such as potato nematodes or larger grain
borer for instance, have a serious impact on the local yield which
will require a lot of money to control.

BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China has become the world's
largest ceramics producer, turning out 1.584 billion sq m of
architectural ceramics and 55 million pieces of sanitary ceramics
annually.
</P>
<P>
China has witnessed a boom in ceramics development over the
past ten years, and has developed more than 800 large and medium-
sized enterprises, as well as thousands of township enterprises in
the architectural and sanitary ceramics sector, according to Wu
Bin, executive vice-president of the Building Materials Chamber of
Commerce under the China Chamber of International Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the cities of Foshan, Tangshan and Boshan have
become the country's largest ceramics production bases.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the booming building sector has provided great
opportunities for the development of architectural and sanitary
ceramics production.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the country's annual urban and rural housing
construction averages at 300 million and 600 million sq m,
respectively, creating a huge market for these products.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The housing price index in China
rose to its highest level of the past 15 months in March,
according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The figures, released today by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS), show that the housing price index grew up to 97.
45 points in March, 3.83 points higher than in February.
</P>
<P>
The NBS said that surges in total area and volume of sales
propelled the housing prices up.
</P>
<P>
Contract investment in real estate also jumped to a seven-month
high in March, increasing 20.4 percent year-on-year to 53.45
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate of funds actually used in real estate
development in March was less than half that of one year ago. The
area of developed land and completed housing also saw slower
growth in March, while stockpiles grew at a more rapid rate.
</P>
<P>
These factors weighed the general indicator of the real estate
industry down to 101.82 points in March, 2.57 points lower than
one year ago, and 0.75 points lower than in February.
</P>
<P>
However, the NBS said that the real estate indicator was still
in the positive zone.

<HEADLINE> Regional Civilization History in South China Pushed Earlier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A three-year long archeological
excavation in Xiaojin Village in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has helped bring forward the local civilization
history by more than 4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Yan Wenming, a professor with the Beijing University, affirmed
that the excavation proves that the Xiaojin Culture is a native
rather than an affiliation moved from other parts of the country
as formerly thought by most Chinese archeologists.
</P>
<P>
The site, some 100 km away from the famous scenic city of
Guilin, is encompassed by mountains. Large amounts of primitive
production instruments and utility devises belonged to the late
Neolithic Age were unearthed since the excavation was carried out
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archeologists announced here that they had to reassess
the origin of the local history, which represents the typical
southern China primitive culture. They now believe that primitive
tribes inhabited in the region as early as 4,000-5,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Stocks of carbonized rice unearthed in the pit suggest the
level of primitive farming. Archeologists can also assessed the
standard of weaving and aesthetic based on the finds of stone
spinning wheels and stone bracelets.
</P>
<P>
Yan said that the archeological team has figured out the
chronic changes from the one meter deep relic layer, which is
rarely distinguishable.
</P>
<P>
They assumed that a primitive community consisted of some 60
members lived here for a pretty long period. They mainly lived on
farming and hunting.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still a mystery whether the tribe was a
matriarchy or a patriarchy, and where it was gone or how it
disappeared, Yan said. Intensive studies are now under way for all
the answers.
</P>
<P>
The South China Culture has been generally considered to have
come into shape much later than that in the north. But research of
some archeological finds in recent years are likely to push
forward the history of the former, which is still little known, as
observed by more Chinese archeologists.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Dependency Blamed for High Mortality Among Australian Aboriginals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Aboriginal Affairs
Minister John Herron blamed Wednesday the high death rate in the
400,000 indigenous population on a culture of welfare dependency,
the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
According to figures issued recently by the Australian Bureau

and 1997 and 41 percent of women, were aged under 50 comparing
with just 13 percent of all male deaths and seven percent of all
female deaths under the age of 50 in Australia in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Earlier statistics showed that the average life expectancy of
the Aboriginals is about 20 years lower than non-Aboriginals.
Heart disease, injury, respiratory disease, cancer and diabetes
were the main causes of their death.
</P>
<P>
Herron said these diseases were caused by unhealthy lifestyles
exacerbated by alcohol and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
"One of the big problems we've got today is welfare dependency,
" Herron told journalists. "Over the past 30 years we've tended to
make Aboriginal people welfare dependent -- all good intentioned
and all that -- but as they tell me they've got sit-down money,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
the Australian government has earmarked around 2 billion
Australian dollars (1.18 billion U.S. dollars) for Aboriginal
communities every year but failed to pull them out from the poor
economic and health conditions.
</P>
<P>
"They don't want sit-down money, they want jobs, they want a
roof over their head, they want education, they want everything
else that every other Australian is entitled to have," the
minister stressed.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Kids Administered Vitamin A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 19 (Xinhua) -- About 2.78 million Nepali
children aged six-month-old to six-year-old were administered
vitamin A capsules in a two-day national vitamin A program that
ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The program which was carried out twice a year by the Ministry
of Health aimed at imparting the knowledge about the importance of
vitamin A which is not sufficient in the diet of Nepalese people.
</P>
<P>
Some 35,000 women volunteers who helped with the program also
made efforts in teaching people to make good use of natural
sources of vitamin A such as green vegetable, fruits, fishes, eggs
and breast feeding to babies.
</P>
<P>
Lack of vitamin A has caused high child mortality rate and
pervasive eye diseases such as cataract and glaucoma in Nepal,
especially in the country's rural areas.

SHANGHAI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Renowned Taiwan electronics and

<HEADLINE> Legal Expert Urges Patent Protection for Traditional Chinese Medicine (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Because existing intellectual
property protection measures fail to protect traditional Chinese
medicine, one legal expert suggested today that China should find
new ways to protect these products.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers should be allowed to patent effective ingredients
and prescriptions, according to Wang Bing, professor at the Law
School of Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Judicial bodies should check technical characteristics for the
purpose of identifying any possible infringement, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to theories of Chinese medicine, effective
ingredients are a class of compounds used in various Chinese
medicine prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
 The most effective method to protect these compounds is for
enterprises to file patent applications for the chemical
components, the law professor said.
</P>
<P>
"But it is not possible to do this based on current
technologies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As with other medicines, Chinese medicine is the result of
human intelligence and has commercial value," he said, "therefore,
it is also a kind of intellectual property and should be protected
by law."
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, Chinese people contributed their
intelligence to Chinese medicine and have left more than 100,000
traditional prescriptions.

<TEXT>
<P>
"It is difficult for the present legislation to fully protect
the intellectual property rights of Chinese medicine since the
intellectual property protection system was set up far later than
the development of Chinese medicine," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there are many cases in which the intellectual
property rights of Chinese medicine are infringed, but nothing can
be done by legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A new kind of medicine might be quickly produced by an
enterprise which is not the legal owner of the medicine after it
is developed," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In this case, the enterprise which develops the medicine
obtains no reasonable returns, and this limits the overall
development of Chinese medicine, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Patent Law issued in 1985 protects the process of medicine
manufacturing rather than its chemical substances.
</P>
<P>
As foreigners understand more and more about the negative
effects of Western medicine, development of new medicines from
natural plants, particularly from traditional Chinese medicine,
has became quite popular.
</P>
<P>
Some companies in developed countries rampantly copy Chinese
medicine, causing China to lose its intellectual property rights
in this field, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Armed Police Speed up Modernization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China's People's Armed Police
Force has speeded up the upgrading of its command, monitoring,
maintenance, and other related systems with advanced
telecommunications and Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
Today's Liberation Army Daily reports that most of the armed
police corps in provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions
have created comprehensive combat command systems integrating the
use of computers and telecommunications technology.
</P>
<P>
The upgraded command systems can enhance communications between
tens of thousands of duty posts nationwide, and among armed police
corps in municipalities and provinces with their Beijing-based
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The global positioning system and the mobile-based microwave
televised reconnaissance system also provide reliable resources
for command personnel.
</P>
<P>
Modernized devices helped to safely solve more than 10
kidnapping cases last year, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Advanced armored carriers, multi-functional refueling trucks,
field water-supply vehicles, and other kinds of equipment have
also helped enhance the combat capability of the armed police.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that now the armed police's capacity to deal
with unexpected events while fulfilling their regular duties has
been greatly improved.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh, India in Race for Investment in Jute Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India are in the
race to attract a one billion U.S. dollars foreign direct
investment (FDI) in the jute sector, local English newspaper
Financial Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Bangladesh might be deprived of the big
chunk of FDI because of a skillful lobby of India to grip the
investment.
</P>
<P>
An American firm has planned to set up a thermoplastic jute
composite plant in either of the two countries and the mentioned
investment will span a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bangladesh and India, China is also in the
competition for the FDI when the U.S. firm decides to produce flax
or sisal hemp instead jute fibers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The American company, which was said to be "extremely committed
" to the project, has already made required technology,
financing and marketing arrangements for the plant, the report
said, without giving the company's name.
</P>
<P>
While senior official in the just defunct International Jute
Organization (IJO) R. Mandal was quoted as saying that India is in
the most advantageous position to get the investment, Bangladeshi
experts believe that the country is supposed to attract the U.S.
investment as the country has a vast scope to diversify jute
products and a huge surplus volume of raw jute at comparatively
low cost, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Tea Export Target Not to Be Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export target for tea
in the current fiscal year will not be fulfilled, the Financial
Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reasons given for the expected failure in fulfilling of the
export target included the falls in tea production and quality
this year, the plummeting of tea price in the international market,
and the increase of local consumption of tea due to the
urbanization process.
</P>
<P>
According to information obtained from the Export Promotion
Bureau(EPB), the export target for tea was set at 40 million U.S.
dollars.During the first eight months of the current fiscal (July
1900-February 2000), 8.48 million kilograms of tea valued at 12.19
million dollars were exported.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Intel Reports 37 Percent Profits For First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest microprocessor maker, said Tuesday that its first-quarter
net income rose 37 percent, including acquisition-related charges,
according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clara, California-based chip maker reported net
income of 2.7 billion U.S. dollars, or 78 cents a share, including
acquisition-related charges and a 17 cents tax benefit gain, from
2 billion dollars, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Excluding acquisition-related costs, Intel reported net income
of 3.1 billion dollars, or 88 cents a share, which included 17
cents a share from tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
Revenues rose to 8.0 billion dollars, up from 7.1 billion
dollars in the first quarter of 1999, with PC sales stronger than
expected in the traditionally sluggish quarter that follows the
Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
Sequentially, revenues in the latest quarter were down 2
percent from the prior fourth quarter, as the company had
predicted in January, due to seasonality.
</P>
<P>
"Demand was stronger in the quarter -- across all product lines
-- than we had anticipated," said Andy Bryant, Intel's chief
financial officer. "It was microprocessors, chipsets, flash (
memory chips)... Demand was stronger than anticipated and as a
result we did not meet all the demand in the quarter. If we had
had more parts, we could have shipped them."
</P>
<P>
Intel also said it expected second quarter revenues to come in
about even with the first quarter and that product supply would
continue to be tight in the current second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, among the 150 or so Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies
that had already reported their latest results by Tuesday
afternoon, 71 percent of them had beaten analyst profit forecasts
for the first three months of the year, according to First Call/
Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two-thirds of the 500 major companies are due to
report their first-quarter profits and revenues over the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the fright of recent days, the earnings news thus
far has been soothing, if not encouraging.

<HEADLINE> Cowens Named Head Coach for Warriors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Dave Cowens was named head
coach for the Golden State Warriors on Tuesday, becoming the 19th
coach in Warriors franchise history.
</P>
<P>
Once the coach of the Charlotte Hornets, Cowens joined Golden
State's staff on January 31, but the Warriors are without the
playoff berth for the sixth straight year. They are 19-62 and
have the third-worst record in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
However, the Warriors acquired second-year guard Larry Hughes
in February who can pair with forward Antawn Jamison next season.
Jamison was leading the team in scoring before suffering a season-
ending knee injury just before Hughes' arrival.
</P>
<P>
Cowens, 51, guided Charlotte to a 109-70 (.609) record in 179
games but resigned March 8, 1999 after the Hornets opened the
lockout-abbreviated season with just four wins in their first 15
games.
</P>
<P>
Voted one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, Cowens had a
stellar career primarily with the Boston Celtics. He served as
player-coach for 68 games during the 1978-79 season.
</P>
<P>
Cowens also served as an assistant on the San Antonio Spurs'
staff. His career coaching record is 136-111 (.551).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Embarking on Transition to K-Economy (1)  By Wu Dingbao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's National Congress
for Youths on K-Economy (knowledge-based economy) concluded
Tuesday with the consensus that the country and its people should
leapfrog into the knowledge economy.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference aimed at wooing youths to get involved
in K-economy was one of a series of forums to be held to gather
feedback and ideas from the people towards realizing the K-economy,
as the Malaysian government is making great efforts to speed up
the transition of the economy from present production-based to
knowledge-based.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the government is in the process of drafting the
first National Master Plan on the country's K-economy, which is
expected to be completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Deputy Finance Minister Chan Kong Choy disclosed
last month that a national strategic plan identifying key sectors
in the Master Plan would be announced in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the initiatives to steer Malaysia towards K-economy
earlier this month, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said the vital
measures that need to be taken under the Master Plan would be
incorporated in the 2001 budget to be presented in October.
</P>
<P>
He said a series of concrete plans of action in key strategic
areas will be completed within one year while the whole process of
national consultation and national mobilization will be completed
in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The transition of the economy from production-based to
knowledge-based implies that the manufacturing sector, which
accounts for more than one third of the gross domestic product (
GDP) of the country, would face new challenges including
advancements in Information and communications technology (ICT).
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the manufacturing sector, which will continue to
assume an important role in the K-economy, has been urged to
adjust to the rapid change of pace to commit itself for the
enhancement of knowledge in all aspects of economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Spurred by the drive towards to the K-economy, the local
information technology (IT) market was projected to expand fast at
an average annual growth rate of more than 13 percent from now to
2004.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to the latest survey findings by research firm
International Data Corp (IDC), the local IT market is projected to
record a growth of 18.6 percent this year with IT spending hitting
6.76 billion ringgit (1.778 billion U.S. dollars) compared with
the estimated 5.7 billion ringgit (1.5 billion dollars) in 1999
and some 5 billion ringgit (1.315 billion dollars) in 1998, and by
2004, the value of IT spending on the local market is estimated to
be worth 10.87 billion ringgit (2.86 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This year alone, there will be 1.89 million Internet users in
Malaysia with 1.06 million Internet devices deployed, the research
firm said.
</P>
<P>
However, the implementation of the K-economy concept is not
confined to information technology and communications but also
covers other sectors including education and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that in transforming to K-Economy, there exists a
digital gap between areas equipped with basic amenities for
electricity, telephone lines, computers and the Internet and those
areas which are not so well equipped, the Malaysian government
together with the private sector are taking steps to bring
communications facilities and electric power to the people in
efforts to reduce the digital gap.
</P>
<P>
For example, the number of telephones for every 100 residents
in Malaysia in 1995 was 16.6 and the ratio was expected to
increase to 23.3 this year.
</P>
<P>
In terms of electricity supply, Malaysia has succeeded in
providing coverage in Peninsular Malaysia to 100 percent, while
coverage for Sarawak and Sabah, the two states in East Malaysia,
is 80 percent and 75 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
To accelerate the transformation to K-economy, Malaysia's
strategies are placing greater emphasis on enhancing the nation's
knowledge reservoir to increase the levels of efficiency,
productivity and human resources skills to meet the demands of
global market.
</P>
<P>
The government has introduced IT in primary and secondary
schools to produce a new generation of creative and innovative IT-
literate Malaysians to meet the manpower needs of the nation in
the fields of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
To this end, more than 1,200 teachers have been trained to
conduct the computer-in-education program in schools.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Old Man Dead for 6 Years Before Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI,April 18 (Xinhua) -- An old man was found dead alone
in a Helsinki apartment last week and police said he died six
years ago, press reports here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police found a mummy inside an apartment in Maunula district
last Friday after they were called in by maintenance men who had
been trying to install fire alarms for the apartment but got no
one to answer the door and smelt a strange odor from inside.
</P>
<P>
From the dates of the ads scattered in the room, the police
identified the deceased as a retiree who died six years ago at 55.
</P>
<P>
The man was said to have children who were living in the same
city, and used to get on well with his neighbors. For the past six
years, social welfare authorities transferred monthly retirement
pensions to his banking account and the social affairs department
under the municipality collected rent from his account each month.
</P>
<P>
Many people, particularly those living in the capital, were
shocked at the news.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish TV commented Tuesday that the event was a mockery
to a nation enjoying sophisticated information technology, a
tragedy for the developed welfare society, and an exposure of the
extent of bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
It constituted a breach of duty on the part of the social
administration, Basic Services Minister Osmo Soininvaara said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid similar tragedies in the future, the social affairs
administration under the Helsinki municipality decided Tuesday to
modify relevant ordinances.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Web-Enabled Community Expects Explosive E-Commerce Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. companies dealing with
the Internet transaction predict in a Tuesday's survey an
explosive e-commerce growth, migration to next-generation
solutions and a major shift in revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by U.S. management consulting firm A.T.
Kearney, offers the first comprehensive look at the present state
and future prospects of business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce
within this Web-enabled community. The findings are based on 85
interviews with these "net market makers" serving 10 industries.
</P>
<P>
All companies interviewed said that they expect explosive
revenue growth, and more than 80 percent forecast annual growth
rate in their employees bases of more than 200 percent over the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
"This optimism is not unwarranted," Kearney said, commenting on
the study results. "Buyers and sellers alike are struggling with
the high total cost of transactions, fragmented and multi-layered
supply chains, inefficient purchasing processes and poor
communications that characterize today's traditional market place.
The e-commerce solutions address those concerns and are being
sought after by industries across the board."
</P>
<P>
The study shows that as trading models become more advanced in
response to market demand, commerce solutions will have to evolve
to support buyer and seller needs. In fact, the companies with "
dynamic trading capabilities" through auction and liquid exchanges
said that they are looking for next-generation solutions. And
those that lack dynamic trading indicated that they plan to add
auction and exchange capabilities.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, net market makers predict a major
shift in revenue sources from transaction fees to value-added
services such as content management, logistics, escrow and payment
services, inventory management, risk management and order
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
Right now, 87 percent of the companies rely on transaction fees
as their primary source of revenue, with only 10 percent
generating revenue from value-added services.

<HEADLINE> Two Major Japanese Banks Announce Alliance Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (BTM)
and Mitsubishi Trust &AMP; Banking Corp. said Wednesday they have
agreed to integrate their management under a joint holding company
in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Trust Bank and Tokyo Trust Bank, both BTM subsidiaries,
will also join the alliance, the banks said.
</P>
<P>
The integration will create the world's fifth largest and Japan
's fourth biggest banking group by assets. BTM and Mitsubishi
Trust held 85.19 trillion yen (815.2 billion dollars) in combined
assets as of September 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed integration, BTM and Mitsubishi Trust will
establish a joint holding company, with two chief executive
officers coming from each of the two banks.
</P>
<P>
Once integrated, BTM will focus on conventional banking such as
lending and deposit-taking, while Mitsubishi Trust will conduct
mainly asset trust and management, the banks said.
</P>
<P>
The alliance will be the first in Japan involving a trust bank
and a major commercial bank with a nationwide branch network.
</P>
<P>
The integration would give the final finish to ongoing plans to
reconfigure Japan's nine "city" banks into four major banking
groups, the Mizuho Financial Group, the Sanwa-Tokai-Asahi group,
the Sumitomo-Sakura group and finally the BTM-led group.
</P>
<P>
The Mizuho Financial Group, consisting of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
Fuji Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan, will be formed at the
end of September.
</P>
<P>
The Sanwa-Tokai-Asahi camp will be established in April 2001 by
Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank.
</P>
<P>
The planned Sumitomo-Sakura alliance, which will have Sumitomo
Bank and Sakura Bank, will be created by April 2002.

<HEADLINE> IBM Reports Better-Than-Expected Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 18 (Xinhua) -- International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) Tuesday reported a three-percent increase in
first-quarter profit, easily beating Wall Street estimates,
according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
The world's leading computer company earned 1.52 billion
dollars, or 83 cents a share, in the three months ending in March,
up from 1.47 billion dollars, or 78 cents per share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The results beat the 78-cent per share First Call consensus
estimate. However, revenue fell 5 percent to 19.3 billion dollars
from 20.3 billion dollars in the year-earlier quarter.
</P>
<P>
IBM, like other computer manufacturers, has been hurt by
weakness in corporate spending on new computers in the first few
months after the Year 2000 date change, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Hardware revenue dropped by 12 percent to 7.7 billion dollars,
as sales of personal computers and other products declined.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from IBM Global Services totaled 7.6 billion dollars,
flat over the year-earlier period amid the sale of the IBM Global
Network last year to AT&AMP;T Corp. and a severe year-over-year drop
in Y2K-related service revenue. Software revenue was also flat at
2.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter was a difficult transitional quarter," Chief
Financial Officer John Joyce said in a conference call with
analysts. But "our business portfolio is improved and the pipeline
of opportunity has started to build."
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, among the 150 or so Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies
that had already reported their latest results by Tuesday
afternoon, 71 percent of them had beaten analyst profit forecasts
for the first three months of the year, according to First Call/

The remaining two-thirds of the 500 S&AMP;P companies are due to
report their first-quarter profits and revenues over the next two
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Hospitals, More Doctors in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Statistics released by China's
Ministry of Health (MOH) today show a drop in the number of
medical institutes, a slow growth in the ranks of medical
personnel, and imbalanced development among urban and rural health
care services.
</P>
<P>
China had a total of 311,000 hospitals, clinics, disease
prevention agencies, health care centers, research institutes, and
medical schools and colleges by the end of 1999, compared with 314,
100 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some 5.57 million people worked in these institutions, a rise
of about 35,000 over 1998.
</P>
<P>
The MOH report shows that 239 hospital beds, 102 nurses, and
167 doctors were available for every 100,000 Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
A health care network composed of medical facilities at the
county, township, and village levels now covers some 90 percent of
China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
However, the development of health care services in cities and
rural areas remains imbalanced due to the investment gap.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 80 percent of the health care budget has been
earmarked for cities, with some 80 percent of this funding going
to major urban hospitals. The growth of basic health care for
rural residents, or 69 percent of the total population, remains
slow due to inadequate investment, according to a MOH official.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and clinics nationwide accepted about 2.08 billion
patient visits last year, and about 50 million people were
hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Criticizes U.S.'s Human Rights Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Official newspaper The New Light
of Myanmar Wednesday criticized the United States for its
continuous accusations of other countries on human rights.
</P>
<P>
"America, while ignoring human rights violation at home and
peaceful and developed situations of other countries, is firing
air bullets of accusations continuously," said the newspaper in an
article.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.' state and labor departments issue slanderous

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Tighten Liquidity to Stabilize Rupiah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to help stabilize the
weakening rupiah, Bank Indonesia, the Indonesian central bank,
will continue to tighten domestic liquidity conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to Bank Indonesia's Deputy Director of Economic and
Monetary Research Halim Alamsyah, the bank aims at bringing down
the size of base money to below April's 86 trillion rupiah (about
11.4 billion U.S. dollar) target by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to control the monetary condition more carefully ...
we'll adopt a tight bias (policy). But this doesn't mean that we'
re going to raise interest rates," he was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Halim explained that the central bank's tighter liquidity
measure did not have to be accompanied by higher interest rates
because domestic banks currently had excessive liquidity, enabling
them to purchase Bank Indonesia's notes at the current low
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He said the size of the base money over the past couple of
weeks was already about 90 trillion rupiah (about 12 billion U.S.
dollars), or above the target.
</P>
<P>
"So we tend to be more tight," he said, adding that the policy
was taken at the recent central bank board of governors meeting.
</P>
<P>
Halim was responding to the current weakening of the value of
the rupiah against the U.S. dollar. The rupiah has been indirectly
affected by the bearish sentiment in the world stock market.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed lower on Tuesday at 7,733 rupiah against the
U.S. dollar from 7,675 rupiah previously.
</P>
<P>
The government and the central bank has targeted the rupiah to
be trading at 7,000 rupiah per U.S. dollar this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Halim said the current weakening of the rupiah was not
yet worrying. "The market still thinks that this (weakening) is
temporary," he said.
</P>
<P>
The important thing for the central bank is to make sure the
weakening of the rupiah does not threaten its inflation target for
this year, according to the bank official.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's underline inflation target for this year is
3 to 5 percent, or 5 to 7 percent if the planned increased in fuel
prices is taken into account.

A key element of the study will be the improvement of the
environmental conditions and promotion of environmental awareness
programs within the local communities, said the report, adding
that the improvement plan is expected to be completed by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year Sri Lanka recorded an all time high tourist arrival

<HEADLINE> Riots Continue in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite the heavy presence of
security personnel, sectarian riots continued sporadically in the
Poso city, Indonesia's Central Sulawesi province, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Wednesday, smoke was seen
billowing from buildings across the paralyzed town, about 2,000
kilometers northeast of Jakarta. Markets and shops were closed as
fearful residents stayed indoors.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 people whose homes were burned down in the unrest have
been evacuated. Many of them were sheltered at local military
dormitory and offices.
</P>
<P>
In the flight, the reports said, many of the people brought
nothing but the clothes they were wearing.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Wirabuana Military Command overseeing
Sulawesi Maj. Joko Warsito said at least 600 reinforcements were
sent to the area.
</P>
<P>
"We've just deployed another 200 troops from the Infantry
Battalion 711 in addition to more than 100 reinforcements sent
there soon after the riots exploded. We just don't want the unrest
to develop on a bigger scale," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in Poso was sparked by a fight between teenagers
at the bus terminal on Sunday, which grew into clashes between
residents from Lambogia and Kayamanya villages.
</P>
<P>
Joko said Poso was vulnerable to sectarian riots. Residents
living in the northern area clashed many times with those in the
south.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted military and political observers as
saying that Sulawesi could descent into communal violence after
the prolonged sectarian strife in the neighboring Maluku, which
has claimed thousands of lives since it broke out in January 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu Tuesday called on Western countries to take
concrete actions as soon as possible to fulfill the Stability Pact
for South Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here with Dutch Defense Minister Frank de
Grave, Constantinescu complained that Western countries have done
little but talked too much about matters concerning stability and
development in the Balkan area.
</P>
<P>
The president said the governments of the Balkan countries have
little trust in the western countries after the Kosovo crisis. He
said that it is time for those countries to keep their promises of
providing financial aid to the Balkan countries and to take
immediate actions to reopen the riverway of the Danube River,
which was damaged by NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, the Dutch minister said that the Netherlands
firmly supports Romania's membership of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. He promised his country will try to persuade other
developed nations to carry out the stability pact with financial
support.
</P>
<P>
Grave, who arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit to Romania,

MONTEVIDEO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay is considering the
purchase of a satellite used to collect data for agriculture and

Gimenez said the new satellite would provide detailed reports

It will also be used to collect important data for studies on
fish shoals, and on the depth of Rio de la Plata and the Atlantic

<HEADLINE> Feature: Organic Tea Village is Cancer-free (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Zhangshan Village may be even
more well-known in Europe than in China: the village now accounts
for 60 percent of the organic tea products on the European Union
market.
</P>
<P>
Zhangshan, a small village in Wuyuan County of East China's
Jiangxi Province, is located in Dazhangshan Mountains 900 meters
above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the highest peak of Dazhangshan, Zhangshan is
surrounded by trees and tea plantations, with a small river
running through.
</P>
<P>
With ideal climate and peculiar fertile soil, the village had
for generations produced tribute tea for Chinese emperors in the
past, said village head Wang Qiangtian.
</P>
<P>
The village has 145 households with 577 persons, and most of
them work on tea plantations.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yangqin, a local medical worker who has served the
villagers for more than 20 years, said definitely that according
to the village's medical treatment records, there has never been
any cancer patient among Zhangshan residents, and 80 percent of
elderly people died of no illness.
</P>
<P>
Average life expectancy is 73 years for all villagers and 78
for females, and there are now a dozen of octogenarians or even
centenarians.
</P>
<P>
Wang the medical worker attributed the good health and
longevity of villagers to the surrounding environment and the
healthy foods villagers eat.
</P>
<P>
Zhangshan Village has no industries. Villagers never use
pesticide in planting tea and vegetables, and they never use
manufactured fodder in raising pigs and chickens.
</P>
<P>
Wang the village head said most of the villagers love the life
there. "Although there is no disco and Internet, young people are
still dressed in fashionable styles," Wang added.
</P>
<P>
He said less than 5 percent of villagers have left the village
to work in other places in Jiangxi or other provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
However, the village is not isolated. More and more outsiders
including foreigners are visiting Zhangshan.
</P>
<P>
Most visitors come to the village to enjoy the beautiful scenes
and historical sites, for archeologists believe the village has
some of the best-preserved ancient houses in the country. But
among the foreigners some are tea traders from Europe who come for
the village's leading product -- Dazhangshan Mountain Tea.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the village has regained its glory as
a famous tea producer.

<HEADLINE> More Centenarians in Scenic Spot of Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- There are more centenarians in
the Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna, a scenic spot in
southwest China's Yunnan province that attracts some two million
tourists every year.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the Yunnan Health Department,
the proportion of centenarians in Xishuangbanna's total population
is higher than that of Yunnan Province and the whole country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were 37 centenarians among its
population of 830,000, meaning there were 44 centenarians among
one million people, compared to a national average of 5.67 and the
provincial average of 7.2.
</P>
<P>
Local heath officials attributed their longevity to good
nutrition, clean environment and better medical facilities in the
tropical rain forest area.
</P>
<P>
But they pointed out that this was not the case 40 years ago,
when tropical epidemics were rampant in the area and the average
life expectancy at that time was not older than 34.
</P>
<P>
After New China was born in 1949, the Central Government has
sent many medical teams to the area to treat ethnic people and
train local doctors, they added.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, there were 132 hospitals and other medical facilities
in the resort, compared to only 6 hospitals in 1950s, they noted
</P>
<P>
Now the average life expectancy of Xishuangbanna people is 66
years old and the number of people aged 70 and above has exceeded
one thousand.

<P>
In 1996, the Dazhangshan Mountain Tea became the first among
the country's hundreds of varieties of tea to win the "AA" mark
for organic food, awarded by the China Organic Food Development
Center.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the organic food monitoring and testing agency of the
European Union (EU) carried out an on-the-spot examination and
proved that the Dazhangshan Mountain Tea is completely free of
pesticide.
</P>
<P>
The certification gives the Dazhangshan Mountain Tea a permit
to enter markets of 140 countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, villager Yu Lianfang brought self-made Dazhangshan
Mountain Tea to the '99 Kunming World Horticulture Expo to compete
with over 140 other tea products. The tea won one of the two gold
medals for tea products.
</P>
<P>
Hong Peng, chairman of the Organic Product Group Company of
Wuyuan County, disclosed that 60 percent of the organic tea on the
EU market is the Dazhangshan Mountain Tea. Its export volume rose
from 1 ton in 1997 to 600 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, orders from EU nations for Dazhangshan
Mountain Tea have amounted to 1,200 tons.
</P>
<P>
Wuyuan County is one of China's first 50 counties designated
for developing ecology-friendly agriculture. The county has closed
down all the paper-making mills, and helped most of local farmers
to shift from firewood to biogas or using fuel-efficient stoves
for cooking.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shupeng, an academician with the China Academy of Sciences,
and a group of scientists recently made an inspection tour of
Jiangxi, and they concluded that the environments of many
localities in the province are similar to that of Zhangshan
Village. They believe Jiangxi has the potential to establish
China's first ecology-friendly regional economy.

HEFEI, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign trade in east China's Anhui
Province was reported to rise 47.8 percent year-on-year to 770
million US dollars during the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Imports went up 55.5 percent to 311 million US dollars and

</P>
<P>

<P>
The province's exports to Asia are growing and reached 220

crisis.

MEXICO CITY, April 18 (Xinhua)-- Mexicans held a 110-kilometer
march near the U.S. border areas Tuesday to protest the death of
their compatriots who tried to enter the U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
The protest, called "Emigrant's Way of the Cross", began in
Tijuana city, southern Mexico, bordering the United States, and
will end in Mexican area called La Rumorosa Friday.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the march said that a total of 502 people have
died when they tried to enter the American side illegally since
the U.S. government implemented "Operation Guardian" in the
Mexican-U.S. border area in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The operation for greater border vigilance has forced emigrants
to use more dangerous ways, and as a result some of them died from
dehydration, cold or isolation.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the protesters said he hopes the U.S. and
Mexican governments will make more flexible migration policies to
prevent further deaths.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company Builds New Chip Against Hacker Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A Silicon Valley-based
company has built a new chip for its networking equipment that can
prevent intruders from attacking Web sites.
</P>
<P>
Juniper Networks, a leading provider of next-generation
Internet protocol infrastructure systems, said Tuesday that it is
shipping the new processor that can scan all the data flowing
through a network without slowing down the traffic.
</P>
<P>
The company called it a breakthrough in application specific
integrated circuit (ASIC), designed to integrate a large number of
functions in one chip so as to boost data handling to the speed
and capacity of optical pipes.
</P>
<P>
The new chip, called Internet Processor II, could prevent the
hacker attacks that crippled many of the top Web sites in February,
according to the company.
</P>
<P>
The security feature was available in software in the past, but
it slowed down networks so much that Internet service providers
and telecommunications carriers only used it sparingly, Juniper
said. The new chip can filter 20 million packets of data per
second, while security software in the past could only scan 200,
000 packets of data per second.
</P>
<P>
The Internet Processor II has over 2.5 million gates, twice the
size of, and offering far richer capabilities than, Internet
Processor, the first-generation ASIC introduced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Juniper said that the new processor will allow service
providers to offer new services to customers. Because the chip can
view the packets of Net information, it allows service providers
to give higher priority to more important data.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Wetland Reserve to Be Built in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to build a state-
level wetland reserve at the sources of Yangtze, Yellow and
Lancang rivers to protect the largest highland wetland in the
world from deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Application on the establishment of the preserve has been
submitted to the Qinghai Provincial Government and is expected to
be approved by the State Council, China's highest governing body,
at the end of this year, said Lu Wenzheng, an official of the
provincial department of agriculture and forestry.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, the natural ecological systems, often referred to as
the earth's "kidneys," play an important role in water
conservation and the prevention of erosion and flooding.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the wetland at the sources of China's three rivers
has a weak ecological system. If the system is damaged, it will
harm the environment not only in the area but also in eastern
China and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The would-be reserve is to cover an area of 236,000 square
kilometers with a population of 262,000. It will be divided into
three parts, the central area, buffer zone and demonstration zone.
</P>
<P>
The central area comprises heads of the three rivers, marshland
and habitat of wildlife. It will be closed to livestock grazing.
Its surrounding areas will be the buffer zone where herdsmen are
allowed to graze sheep and cattle. The demonstration zone is to be
built at nearby towns and farmland for ecological and tourism
development.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics offered by the National Administration of
Forestry (NAF) indicate that the number of China's wetland
reserves has risen to 260, covering an area of more than 16
million hectares.
</P>
<P>
China plans to build more wetland reserves in its northeast and
northwest regions, and will work to get more of China's wetlands
added to the list of Wetlands of International Importance this
year.
</P>
<P>
Since the country signed the Wetlands Convention of
International Importance, Especially in Waterfowl Habitats, in
1992, seven of the country's wetland sites have been included on
the international list.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands area has been declining in China, especially in recent
years, due to population growth and rapid economic development.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Urged to Help the Poor in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China encourages private
entrepreneurs to continue to focus on eliminating poverty in the
western and central provinces, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"The country's strategic shift to the western areas has offered
investors a rare opportunity," said Jing Shuping, president of All-
China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The Glorious Program, initiated by 10 private entrepreneurs six
years ago, aims to provide financing for China's poverty-stricken
central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that 3,508 private entrepreneurs has spent 10.521
billion yuan (1.3 billion U.S. dollars) on 3,829 projects of the
program by the end of last year, and the program was mainly
carried out for the industrialization and development of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They have offered jobs to 761,500 people and provided training
to 733,600 people. A total of 1.9 million people have been
relieved from poverty, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged private entrepreneurs to make careful plans to
promote the steady progress of the program.
</P>
<P>
"The program has played an important role in eliminating
poverty and maintaining social stability because private
entrepreneurs have integrated their capital, information,
management and technology with the natural resources and labor of
the poor regions," the paper quoted Wang Zhaoguo, director of the
CPC United Front Work Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wang's department and Jiang's federation are both sponsors for
the program.

<HEADLINE> China to Allow House Developers Going Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- China has abolished a six-year
ban on house developers issuing stocks to the public, according to
official sources from the Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the aim of the new policy is to support China'
s housing reform and encourage large house developers investing in
the construction of houses for rent, which usually takes longer
time to recover investment.
</P>
<P>
China banned housing development enterprises from going public
six years ago to check feverish speculations in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the new policy was proposed by the ministry
and approved last July by the State Council on trial basis.
</P>
<P>
He added that more than 20 house developers nationwide have
applied to the ministry for initial public offerings, while the
ministry plans to approve three of them this year on an
experimental base.
</P>
<P>
The ministry requires that housing developers spend no less
than 70 percent of the funds raised through the issuance of stocks
on housing development, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Against Students' Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- An anti-mental depression
campaign, focusing on college students, was started at Beijing
University this week.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the project was designed to
help college students, who have been suffering from depression, to
get better through both psychological and medical care.
</P>
<P>
Li Ningzhong, a 1999 graduate in finance from Beijing
University, is the initiator of the project, who has been hampered
by depression for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Li recovered from the disease which almost drove him to suicide
under a doctor's care.
</P>
<P>
"I have noticed that there are still many college students who
are suffering from mental depression, and that prompted me to
start this program," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Psychological Department of Beijing University and Beijing
Medical University gave Li support when he prepared this program,
and their mental disease experts promised to provide free
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen Xueshi, a prestigious psychological expert,
revealed that depression has led to more than one-fourth of the
suicide cases in the country in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Special research focusing on mentally ill patients at eight
selected universities during 1991-1995 showed that the suicide
caused by mental depression is 24 per 100,000 students.
</P>
<P>
According to their promotion plan, a series of publicity
activities will be launched at colleges nationwide with the help
of the Ministry of Education.

<HEADLINE> 23 Drug Traffickers Killed in Northeastern Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces killed 23
drug traffickers and arrested another one during the past two days
in the northeastern Khorasan province, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The forces said that the drug traffickers were killed in five
separate armed clashes, in which over 784 kilograms of various
narcotics, including 47 kilograms of heroin were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that over 55 tons of narcotics were
confiscated in the province during the past Iranian calendar year
that ended on March 19. Some 285 traffickers were killed in armed
clashes and 515 injured while 33 Iranian anti-drug personnel lost
their lives in the period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 102 kilograms of hashish concealed in a vehicle
was seized recently in the Minab area of southeastern Hormuzgan
province and one smuggler was arrested and handed over to the
judicial authorities.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Vice President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Hashemi
said early this month that Iran confiscated over 253 tons of
different kinds of narcotics in 1999, including six tons of heroin,
22 tons of morphine, 204 tons of opium, 18 tons of hashish and
three tons of other drugs.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and neighboring
Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Iran started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the Majlis
(parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital punishment
for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that some 2900 anti-drug forces have been killed in
operations since the Islamic revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Conservatives Demand Punishing Reformists for Attending Berlin Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Over 140 members of the outgoing
conservative-dominated Iranian Majlis (parliament) on Wednesday
called on the judiciary to put on trial the Iranian reformists who
attended the Berlin conference last week on Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the hard-line parliamentarians condemned those
who took part in the conference "where the counter-revolutionaries
had insulted the Iranian nation," the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
They accused the reformists in the Berlin conference of
advocating United States-style reforms in Iran, which the supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei strongly rejected in a speech on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The conference was held by the Heinrich Boell Foundation on Iran
after the February Iranian parliamentary elections in which
reformists won an overwhelming victory over the powerful
conservatives, who control most of the country's sensitive organs.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservative-dominated state-run television on Tuesday
night showed parts of the conference, particularly a disruption by
members of outlawed Mujaheddin Khalq Organization (MKO) who accused
the Iranian government of "crimes and human rights violations" in
Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The conference organizer had invited some close allies and
supporters of President Mohammad Khatami, including reformist
cleric Yussefi Eshkevari and reformist journalist Akbar Ganji.
</P>
<P>
The participants expressed support for Khatami's reforms and
condemned press censorship and political repression in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran's main reformist party the Islamic Iran Participation Front
(IIPF) on Wednesday accused the state television of trying to stop
the new reformist-dominated parliament from meeting and undermining
Khatami's reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The IIPF, headed by Mohammad Reza Khatami, the president's
younger brother and the top winner in the February polling in
Tehran, said that broadcasting the selective parts of the
conference on the national television is a provocative act serving
only factional interests.
</P>
<P>
The broadcast was also strongly condemned as "an insult to
Islamic sanctities" by Khatami's representative on the state radio
and television, Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh.
</P>
<P>
Aminzadeh warned that the management of the television should
bear the responsibility for the consequences of the screening.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been clouded by political tension since the
parliamentary elections which ended a long-time conservative
majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The powerful conservatives, unwilling to accept the humiliating
defeat, have taken strong measures to counter the reformist
campaign, including summoning reformist journalists to courts and
overturning by force part of the election results.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan has stressed
that Iraq will never implement the U.N. Security Council Resolution
1284 because it fails to respond to Iraq's demand for a total
lifting of the decade-old sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, as a product of the British colonialist
mentality designed to put Iraq under its mandate, transferred Iraq
from conditional sanctions to everlasting embargo, Ramadan was
quoted as saying by the Iraqi News Agency (INA) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not pin hope on the U.N. Security Council to lift the
sanctions, but will let the embargo get eroded by itself, said
Ramadan. (Iraq-UN-Resolution)

BUCHAREST, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Romania salutes the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ready to Cooperate With Panama in Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- American Ambassador in Panama
Simon Ferro said Wednesday that his country has always been
interested in cooperating with Panamanian authorities in relation
to the national security project.
</P>
<P>
"We have always been in the best disposition to help Panama,
specially in the area we know. I believe that there are no two
countries in the world that know each other as good as Panama and
the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ferro said that it is still premature to talk about what sort
of cooperation there will be between both countries, for the
Panamanian government must first finish the details of the
Security Strategic Plan, known now as the Foundations of the
Panamanian Security Strategies.
</P>
<P>
"After the government approves the project, then we will be
able to sit, talk and see what we can do," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador considers that it is prudent that Panama
promotes a national and international security plan to safeguard
its territory.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Interior and Justice Minister Winston
Spadafora said that the national government is in the final stage
in the elaboration of the national security project, which has
been modified with the participation of the political parties and
civil society.
</P>
<P>
The current name of the National Security Strategic Plan,
presented last November, was adopted at the suggestion of the
commission of the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD).
</P>
<P>
Spadafora added that the definitive text of the strategic
project will be revealed to public opinion after Easter Week.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian minister said that despite new modifications,
the efficient coordination between the National Police, the
National Maritime Service, the National Air Service, the
Institutional Protection Service, and the Civil Protection
National System will be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Spadafora said that the security project will take into account
points of view from different countries. "It would be as absurd
for Panama as for any other country not to accept advice from any
other nation with more advanced technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that advice from other countries is not a synonym of
the government selling sovereignty. "The agreements will be
related, only to information exchange."
</P>
<P>
The three elements contemplated in the original security plan
are the Authority of the Panama Canal, the democratic system and
its preservation, and the possible risks within Panamanian
territory.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Court Extends Elian's Stay in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel barred anyone from
attempting to remove the boy from the country, extending the
injunction issued last week, an Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the appeals judges as saying that they
recognized the government's authority over immigration matters,
but adding that "We fail to see how an injunction in the case
infringes upon the congressional power."
</P>
<P>
The panel was critical of Immigration and Naturalization
Service's handling of the boy's asylum request, saying "It appears
that never have INS officials attempted to interview plaintiff
about his own wishes."
</P>
<P>
"It is not clear that the INS, in finding plaintiff's father to
be the only proper representative, considered all of the relevant
factors, particularly the child's separate and independent
interests in seeking asylum," the judges wrote in a ruling
statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Attorney General Janet Reno told a regular
briefing that Elian's parents did "a very good job of raising him,
and now it is time for his father to be on with that task."
</P>
<P>
Reno told reporters that the Justice Department will consider
next steps in consultations with President Bill Clinton after the
rule of the appeals court, but she affirmed that the law
enforcement will have to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
"I am dead set and determined to do it the right way, the
safest way, the least violent way, and the soonest way I possibly
can under the law," she added. "We will utilize all law
enforcement options, if appropriate under the 11th Circuit order."
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 near a shipwreck after his
mother and 10 others were killed when their boat capsized in the
sea off Florida and later was sent to his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled early this year the boy belongs to his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and should be returned to Cuba while the
Miami relatives insist Elian stay with them in the United States.
The father arrived early this month and has been waiting for
reunion with his son.
</P>
<P>
The court order upheld Wednesday had temporarily blocked anyone
from taking Elian out of the country until it decides whether to
hear the asylum claims.

QUITO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 died and many people
disappeared as a result of the landslide which took place
Wednesday in the town of Quevedo, southwest of the capital, due to
continuous raining in the eastern part of the country, according
with local reports.
</P>
<P>
At 02:00 local time (0700 GMT), the landslide covered many
houses in a neighborhood of Quevedo, after a heavy downpour that
lasted 12 hours and was strong enough to tear down a wall.
</P>
<P>
Many other places around the country had been affected as well
by the rains last February, when winter's strongest raining period
started, said the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology.
</P>
<P>
The capital was declared in a state of emergency after
landslide in the south zone left four dead and 25 injured, some 20
houses destroyed and about 180 people evacuated.
</P>
<P>
In Cuenca, a strong thunderstorm, in prior days, killed a
person and left 20 people homeless, while in Portoviejo, eight
houses were flooded by the rains and the overflowing of the rivers
that feed the Poza Honda dam.

<HEADLINE> Reno Says "Mafiaboy" Hacker Must Be Punished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno said Wednesday a 15-year-old boy arrested in Canada for
attacking the CNN Website in February must face punishment.
</P>
<P>
The FBI and prosecutors from the Computer Crimes Section have
been working with investigators from the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, and the joint efforts resulted in the arrest of a 15-year-
old suspect, by the Canadian police in Montreal Saturday morning,
Reno told reporters on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who goes by the online name Mafiaboy, has been
charged in connection with the cyberattack on the CNN Network
website.
</P>
<P>
"There has got to be a remedy, there has got to be a penalty,"
Reno said.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said that it is important to let young
people know that they are not going to be able to get away with
something like this because of age.
</P>
<P>
"But more importantly, we have got to renew our efforts to
teach young people cyberethics so that we ensure that this tool is
used by all concerned to expand our opportunity for learning, for
communications, for commerce," she added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Shoppers Increase Internet Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Automotive consumer Internet
usage and online vehicle shopping in the United States increased
significantly from the 1998 to the 1999 model years, according to
a research released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
General Internet usage by automotive shopping increased nearly
12 percent, from 51.6 percent to 57.7 percent, while using the
Internet to shop for new vehicles increased by nearly 27 percent,
from 26.9 percent to 34.1 percent, compared to 1998 model year
figures, according to the study conducted by the Polk Company, the
oldest consumer marketing information firm in America. Polk's
study is based on a mail survey of 27,500 new vehicle owners who
purchased a new vehicle between October 1, 1998 and September 30,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that of the areas registering the largest
number of new vehicle buyers during the 1999 model year,
Washington D.C. ranks first in general Internet usage and vehicle
shopping. Nearly three-quarters of new vehicle buyers there
indicated that they use the Internet on an ongoing basis, and more
than half specifically used the Internet to shop for new vehicle
purchases. Los Angeles ranked second among new vehicle buyers
using the Internet to shop for their new vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles led in terms of Internet buyers. Nationally, almost
three percent of new vehicle buyers purchased their new vehicle
through an Internet-buying service. More than six percent of new
vehicle buyers in Los Angeles, however, purchased their new
vehicle online.
</P>
<P>
The research shows that, the Polk Company said, although there
has been growth in he percentage of consumers using new vehicle
buying Internet services over the past few years, the figure is
still much lower than the number of consumers buying through
traditional purchasing channels.
</P>
<P>
But Polk said that the Internet will continue to grow in
importance for new vehicle buyers during their shopping process,
particularly for shoppers of upscale brands.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Conditionally Backs Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said on Wednesday that he is not opposed to the idea of a minimum
wage as long as it can be applied to ensure rapid economic growth
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remark when addressing representatives of
employers and workers at the Uganda International Conference
Centre in Kampala, according to a press release from the
President's Office.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to support labor either through the wage policy
or through increased investments that create more jobs and
increase demand for labor, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said a wage policy can stimulate or discourage rapid
economic growth and affects investments, he added.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the labour representatives to work with the
government to eliminate the main bottlenecks presently hindering
investments which include high interest rates, lack of serviced
industrial land, high transport costs from the sea ports,
slowness in settling commercial disputes, insecurity in some areas
and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Despite these difficulties, the president said, the government
of the National Resistance Movement has made important strides by
liberalizing the economy, returning the properties of Asians,
establishing a convertible currency and ensuring macro-economic
stability.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Committed to ECOWAS Monetary Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Ghana on Wednesday resolved to
continue to play an active role in the regional monetary
integration despite the financial crisis, Ghana News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kwamena Ahwoi, Minister of Planning, Regional Economic
Cooperation and Integration, told a meeting in Ghana's capital
Accra that the proposed second single monetary zone for the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) may help the
country rid of the current violent exchange rate fluctuation.
Ghana's currency has devaluated by 80 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, or the first session of the Ministerial
Convergence Council on the Second Monetary Zone for ECOWAS, was
attended by ministers of trade, commerce, energy, transport and
governors of central banks from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia,
The Gambia, Sierra Leone and Mali.
</P>
<P>
The first six countries had resolved to form the second
monetary zone by 2003 as a step toward merging with the CFA (West
African Franc) countries to forge a single monetary area covering
the whole West Africa with a population of some 250 million.
</P>
<P>
Mali, current chairman of ECOWAS, is attending the meeting as
an observer.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, Executive Secretary of the ECOWAS, asked the
ministers to examine relevant proposals ahead of the mini-summit
of some ECOWAS members' heads of state which begins on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer for Elian's Father Urges Immediate Action for Reunion of Father and Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The lawyer for the father of
Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez said Wednesday that Atlanta's court
decision to extend the custody of the six-year-old shipwreck
survivor in the United States would not weaken the father's claim
for his son and urged the government to immediately reunite them.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in the order issued today by the 11th Circuit
undermines or weakens this father's legal and moral claim that he
be given immediate custody of his son," Lawyer Gregory Craig said
in a statement at his Washington office.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
panel ruled that no one would be allowed to remove Elian, now
staying in Miami with his distant relatives since his rescue from
a shipwreck last November, from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Craig said the 11th Circuit Court's decision "places the
obligation to act squarely on the shoulders of Attorney General
Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the government did not act immediately to
remove Elian from the custody of his distant great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez and return him to his father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, it
would "bear responsibility for the harm that continues to be
inflicted on Juan Miguel's beloved son."
</P>
<P>
The real issue, Craig said, was not whether the boy would leave
the United States, but "the issue has always been whether this
child would be returned to his father," and when they will reunite.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the United States government to immediate action,
" he said. "It is unconscionable to wait one day longer. To do so
will only cause more harm to Elian."
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Reno told reporters that the Justice
Department would consider next steps in consultations with
President Bill Clinton after the rule of the Circuit Court. She
reaffirmed that the law enforcement would have to be carried out.

<HEADLINE> Smartphones Expected to Flood U.S. Market Beginning 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Revenues from sales of
smartphones in the United States are projected to grow ninefold by
2005 to 7.8 billion U.S. dollars, the American market research
firm Strategis Group said Wednesday in a new report.
</P>
<P>
Emerging in the late 1990s, smartphones are mobile phones that
provide normal voice service as well as any combination of e-mail,
text messaging, pager, Web access and voice recognition. Strategis
expects smartphone sales in the United States to be 867 million U.
S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the research firm, beginning next year the
majority of new handset models will be wireless application
protocol-enabled. "This creates a unique supply-and-demand
situation where new users will receive handsets with wireless data
capabilities whether they plan to use them or not," said the
report, estimating annual smartphone sales to reach 60 million
units by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The wireless device industry is undergoing a major
transformation, the report said. "With the increasing convergence
between voice and data services, questions remain about which
devices will be conduits of these services, particularly in
regards to the emerging wireless Internet." Right now smartphone
and personal digital assistant (PDA) manufacturers have mobilized
their operations to produce devices that will become the wireless
Internet devices.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates there will be more than 9.5 million mobile
high-speed data subscribers in the United States by 2005,
consisting of 6.8 million business subscribers and 2.8 residential
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Strategis believes that wireless application protocol (WAP) is
an ideal interim solution for the wireless Internet. On the demand
side, WAP facilitates use of wireless Internet applications by
bringing the best possible clarity to wireless devices. On the
supply side, WAP solutions are low-cost and will enable operators
to use wireless data to increase subscriber minutes of use, reduce
churn and attract new customers.

<HEADLINE> Ireland, China Agree to Further Promote Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBLIN, Ireland, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Ireland and China agreed
here on Wednesday to make greater efforts to further develop
bilateral cooperation in the fields of science and technology,
education and culture.
</P>
<P>
The two countries came to the agreement at a meeting between
visiting Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Irish Deputy Prime
Minister Mary Harney.
</P>
<P>
In their talks, Harney said the Irish government attached great
importance to developing friendly cooperation with China and in
the government's Asian Strategy worked out in 1999, China was
listed as one of the priority countries with which Ireland was to
develop bilateral cooperation with greater efforts.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the Irish government supported China's early
entry into the World Trade Organization. The settlement of the
issue would further facilitate the healthy development of the
Chinese economy, she said.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing said that he was satisfied with the advance of the
relations between China and Ireland. He noted that Ireland had
sustained a high rate of growth in its economic development in
recent years, an achievement that has attracted world attention.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the development of high-tech industries
in Ireland, a country now known as the software capital of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The experience of development of Ireland was worth of studying
for China, and the Chinese government was willing to join hands
with the Irish government to make common efforts to further
promote exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the
fields of science and technology, education and culture, the
Chinese vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Tuesday on a four-day official visit, the last
leg of his four-nation tour, which has already taken him to Cuba,
where he attended the first South Summit, Malta, and the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, U.S. Start Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The authorities of Mexico and the
United States began to put demarcation signs in remote areas where
the border line between both countries either does not exist or is
barely perceptible.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was proposed by Mexican Ambassador to the United
States Jesus Reyes Heroles to prevent accidental incursions by
police members from both countries, according to reports reaching
here from El Paso (Texas).
</P>
<P>
The bilateral Water and Limits International Commission's
spokeswoman Sally Spener said that this organism started to put
three signs last week, made of reflecting material to be easily
seen in the night.
</P>
<P>
The signs, one meter high and three meter wide, mounted in
metal posts, say in English towards American territory "Limit of
the United States of America" and in Spanish "Limite de los
Estados Unidos Mexicanos" (Limit of the United States of Mexico),
according to Spener.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total 3,200-kilometer border between Mexico and the
United States, 2,120 kilometers are delimited by the Rio Grande (
Rio Bravo) and 1,080 kilometers by a fence that extends from El
Paso (Texas) to the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
In some desert zones many sections of the border fence are
destroyed. Along the land border, some 275 landmarks -- 1.5 meters
X 3 meters -- delimit both countries' border.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Condemns Deliberate Targeting of Civilians in Armed Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Wednesday adopted a resolution reaffirming its
strong condemnation of the deliberate targeting of civilians or
other protected persons in a situation of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council concluded its one-day
open debate on protection of civilians in armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the council noted that the overwhelming
majority of internally displaced persons and other vulnerable
groups in a situation of armed conflict are civilians and, as such,
are entitled to the protection afforded to civilians under
existing international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council said that deliberate targeting of
civilian populations, or other protected persons and the
committing of systematic, flagrant and widespread violations of
international humanitarian and human rights law in a situation of
armed conflict may constitute a threat to international peace and
security and, in this regard, the council reaffirmed its readiness
to consider such situations and, where necessary, to adopt
appropriate steps.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed its intention to collaborate with
representatives of the relevant regional and subregional
organizations, where appropriate, in order further to improve
opportunities for the resolution of armed conflicts and the
protection of civilians in such conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The council underlined the importance of safe and unimpeded
access of humanitarian personnel to civilians in armed conflicts
and called upon all parties concerned, including neighboring
states, to cooperate fully with the United Nations Humanitarian
Coordinator and U.N. agencies in providing such access.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the parties to a conflict to make special
arrangements to meet the protection and assistance requirements of
women, children and other vulnerable groups.
</P>
<P>
The council emphasized the importance for humanitarian
organizations to uphold the principles of neutrality, impartiality
and humanity in their humanitarian activities.
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated its call to all parties concerned,
including non-state parties, to ensure the safety, security and
freedom of movement of United Nations and associated personnel, as
well as personnel of humanitarian organizations.
</P>
<P>
The council affirmed its intention to ensure that peacekeeping
missions are given suitable mandate and adequate resources to
protect civilians.
