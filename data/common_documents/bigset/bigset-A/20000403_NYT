EARNHARDT JR. CAPTURES FIRST WINSTON CUP VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ His swagger replaced by self-doubt, Dale Earnhardt
Jr. walked into Texas Motor Speedway last week looking for a pat on
the back.
</P>
<P>
   He got that from an unexpected source, NASCAR Winston Cup Series
director Gary Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Nelson sat me down this weekend and told me some things
that nobody else had said to me before,'' said Earnhardt Jr., who
limped into Texas Motor Speedway on the heels of consecutive
finishes of 29th, 40th and 38th. ``Gary Nelson sat down with me and
told me he knew I was going to be able to make it and be a good
race car driver, and that I just needed to calm down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   That impromptu pep talk served as a prelude to Little E's
breakthrough Cup victory. Earnhardt Jr. turned his 12th series
start into his first victory, pulling away from points leader Bobby
Labonte and former TMS winner Jeff Burton in the final 53 laps
around the 1.5-mile quadoval. With that, Earnhardt Jr. reached
Victory Lane four races faster than his famous father, a seven-time
NASCAR champion and the first man to greet him yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just told me he loved me,'' Earnhardt Jr. said, after his
father had pulled him out of the cockpit of his red race car. ``And
he wanted to make sure I took the time to enjoy this and relax a
little bit with what we accomplished today.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-time NASCAR Busch Grand National Series champion, Little E
came into Winston Cup armed with a blockbuster $10 million
sponsorship contract from Budweiser and cars provided by his old
man. The preseason favorite for Raybestos Rookie of the Year
honors, Earnhardt Jr. had posted a season's best 10th-place finish
at Las Vegas Motor Speedway before he and his former BGN team had
stumbled at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Darlington Raceway and Bristol
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never really do know if you're going to win, ever,'' said
Earnhardt Jr., who qualified fourth in the No. 8 Budweiser
Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``Guys race and race for years and don't
ever know. I really didn't know what to expect \Rthis year\S. I
didn't know if we were going to be kicking butt right out of the
box or whether we were going to be crappy for a year or two. But I
felt like we could win a race. The odds were not really stacked
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially at TMS. Earnhardt Jr. scored the first victory of his
BGN career here in April 1998, the first of his two consecutive
championship seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a lot of tracks like this that we don't run the
same at,'' said Earnhardt Jr., who qualified fourth. ``\RCar
chief\S Tony Eury Jr. and the guys have a good setup here. We
didn't change nothing all day long. I could adjust my driving line
and style to each set of tires. I didn't have to do a whole lot.
I'd point-and-shoot and that thing ran. That's about all there was
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Earnhardt Jr. was one of 17 drivers involved in a
record 29 lead changes. A record 12 caution flags also played into
the mix, with Earnhardt Jr. and crew chief Tony Eury Sr. opting for
four-tire changes on every pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stuck with four tires because we didn't want to upset the
handling of the car,'' said Earnhardt Jr., who led eight times for
a race-high 106 laps. ``That was the smartest thing we did all day
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, who scored his first Cup victory here in 1997, said any
designs he had on tracking down Little E were slowed by his attempt
to clear Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a long time to get by Bobby,'' said Burton, driver
of the No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford Taurus. ``If I could have
cleared Bobby a little bit quicker, then we could have given him a
run for his money. I had a fast enough car to run with Dale Jr.,
but once I got behind him there was no sense in running the car any
harder than I needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton finished 5.920 seconds behind Little E, and Labonte was
fading at a faster rate _ whether changing two or four tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty screwed up,'' said Labonte, driver of the No. 18
Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand Prix. ``Four was worse than two
was.'' But the native Texan retained his series points lead for the
fifth consecutive week, stretching his advantage to 84 points over
Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace, last week's winner at Bristol, finished fourth,
followed by No. 2 qualifier Kevin Lepage. Wallace, driver of the
No. 2 Miller Lite Ford, scored his second consecutive fourth-place
finish at TMS. Lepage posted his first top-five of 2000, and tied
his career-best Cup result set at Darlington in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Little E said that after the last three weeks, he enjoyed
running at the front again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun to show these guys I could use my head and make
smart decisions,'' said Earnhardt Jr., 25. ``Even when I've got a
real fast car and I'm not up front, I can be patient and pick my
way through there. It was fun to prove that to them, and prove my
status as far as a driver goes.'' nn

BIG-HOME BOOM RANKLES PARADISE VALLEY

(PHOENIX) - Upscale isn't the buzzword in Paradise Valley anymore.
Try large-scale.
</P>
<P>
   Home buyers with money to burn and developers attracted by the
town's reputation as a haven for the rich and famous are snapping
up developed lots and replacing modest homes with modern-day giants
that are two, three or more times as big, at a rate that could set
the tone for the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   That has some worried that the town is losing its coveted rural,
airy feel and becoming a Beverly Hills clone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers us is the big houses in the smaller, older
neighborhoods. It doesn't fit,'' says 18-year Paradise Valley
resident Nan Murley, who, with her neighbors, took on a developer
planning a 10,800-square-foot house on a teardown lot in their
Mummy Mountain neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Boucek, 65, has a few choice words about the
6,000-square-foot, two-story house going up next door to his
one-story, 2,600-square-foot hacienda on East Doubletree Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks,'' he said. ``It's out of proportion. It's out of
character.''
</P>
<P>
   There is less than a year's supply - 100 lots - of vacant
residential land in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, an average of 100 new homes have gone up yearly in
the 5,000-home town, where the minimum lot is 1 acre but the
average size of new homes has risen from 2,000 to 4,000 square feet
40 years ago to 5,000 to 6,000 today. And some houses are being
built to the maximum size allowed on an acre, nearly 11,000 square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   There are enough residents questioning the trend that this month
the Town Council is forming a special citizens committee to
consider tougher ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   John Donatov, a Paradise Valley resident who is a developer,
bought the teardown on Murley's street last July for $585,000. The
planned two-story, four-bedroom, four-bath house already is being
marketed for nearly $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a small hotel,'' Murley said of the design.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors went to the town's hillside building committee.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member group, which includes two Town Council members,
two planning commissioners and a resident, reviews whether plans
conform with the ordinance, which covers issues from lighting and
landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the complaints, the home's size was reduced to 9,000
square feet by eliminating a guest house, an exercise room and one
of four garages, architect John Sproule said.
</P>
<P>
   Sproule says residents will become even more involved as their
neighborhood changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think maybe the problem is sort of made a little bit
worse because of the speed of redevelopment.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucek, a semi-retired insurance consultant who has lived in his
house for 33 years, laments that the new home, with five bedrooms
and 5 1/2 baths, towers above his and blocks his backyard views of
the McDowell Mountains and sunrises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be some sort of regulations protecting the
existing character of older neighborhoods,'' Boucek said.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Lincoln, a former mayor and Town Council member who has
been on the hillside committee for 20 years, hopes the
bigger-is-better trend will reverse in five or six years and thinks
it would help if the committee sat down with home builders before
plans are drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Town Councilman Bernie Barry says the new citizens committee
would focus first on hillside homes because what is built is highly
visible, but he says restrictions that are too tight could affect
land values.
</P>
<P>
   Resident Rick Johnson, 50, a financial planner, welcomes the
big-house building boom.
</P>
<P>
   His neighborhood near 52nd Street and East Doubletree Road is in
transition from tract to custom. Johnson is remodeling and doubling
the size of his 1970s-built home to about 5,300 square feet. At
least a half-dozen neighbors are adding on or building spacious
homes from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variety is nice. It adds character to the neighborhood,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the housing boom started in the early 1990s, housing
values and property taxes have skyrocketed. The median price of the
14 new homes sold in Paradise Valley last year was $951,000. The
median price of existing home sold last year was $660,000. In 1999,
the median property tax bill for a Paradise Valley resident was
$2,846.43.
</P>
<P>
   Murley and Boucek said some longtime residents who have paid off
their homes may find paying the higher taxes difficult. The town
does not levy a property tax, but residents still pay school and
county property taxes. &QL;

shortage. Lawmakers are close to requiring background checks on

A NEW SPIN ON AN OLD TALE

<P>
   NICE, France _ Michelle Kwan was leaving the Palais des
Expositions Friday after placing third in the short program when a
well-wisher approached her. ``I wish the Russians would fall
down,'' she told Kwan. ``For you.'' ``Oh, don't wish that,'' Kwan
told her. ``I don't want any skater to fall down. Wish for me to
skate well.''
</P>
<P>
   It was never about Maria Butyrskaya, who held the women's crown
Kwan had worn twice. It was never about Irina Slutskaya, who had
beaten Kwan in this year's Grand Prix final. It was always about
Kwan skating the way she used to skate, with passion and energy and
daring.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had seen that Kwan since the US Championships two years
ago in Philadelphia, when she blew away Tara Lipinski. And many
skating observers were wondering whether they ever would see her
again.
</P>
<P>
   Did she still want it after seven years? Could she still do it?
Kwan hadn't put together two clean programs at a major event since
the 1998 Olympics, where she'd skated cautiously and watched
Lipinski beat her for the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always tells me I have to be up against the wall before
I fight back,'' Kwan said Saturday night, after she had risen to
beat the Russians and claim her third world title in five years.
``He says, `Why don't you fight back from the very beginning?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan's back was up against the Mediterranean seawall here. No
woman ever had regained the title twice and none since China's Chen
Lu (in 1995) had come out of third to win. And Kwan needed to do
more than win the long program. She also needed Butyrskaya to come
apart. ``That was reality,'' Kwan said. ``I told myself, `Michelle,
you've done this so many times.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe too many times, her critics said. Kwan has been coming to
the global championships since she was 13, since she stepped in for
Nancy Kerrigan after the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer. ``This is my
seventh Worlds,'' she said. ``After a while, it all seems to blur
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan had won the title and lost it, won it back and lost it
again. She had beaten everybody here. But each year, she had to dig
deeper to find the motivation.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with Kwan juggling skating and her freshman studies
at UCLA, was the toughest of all. She was scrambling to find ice,
driving an hour each way from Westwood to practice for an hour.
After living in a mountain hideaway at Lake Arrowhead, she was
bunking in a noisy dorm on a huge campus. ``People don't care if
you're a figure skater,'' said Frank Carroll, Kwan's coach.
``They're going to stay up all night partying. It's their school,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kwan had to pull herself up from third place to beat
orthodontic pursuers Sasha Cohen and Sarah Hughes at the US
Championships, she realized she had to live in the rink if she
wanted to have any chance here. ``No excuses whatsoever,'' Carroll
decreed. ``She had to be there, and I had to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks, Kwan prodded herself, working on the
triple-triple jump combination she needed just to get into the
game. Then, with the world watching and the title on the line, she
pushed herself to the limit, landing not only the combo but five
more triples. ``I wanted to use up all of my energy,'' she said.
``I don't want to come off the ice thinking, `You know, I have a
little more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Drained and exultant, Kwan went backstage to decompress.
``Michelle, you just skated the best program of your life,'' she
told herself. ``No matter what happens, be happy, be happy, be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Butyrskaya and Slutskaya came undone, Kwan found herself on
the top step of the podium, as she always is in even-numbered
years. ``What happened in the odd years?'' she wondered.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tick-tock cycle, the 27-year-old Butyrskaya mused, after
she'd given back the crown. ``Things are repeating themselves,''
she said. ``This is sport. Michelle was first, then second, then
first again. It's just a normal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   No women's champion has repeated since Kristi Yamaguchi in 1992.
Some, like Lipinski, moved on after their Olympic gold. Others,
like Chen, never recaptured the magic. The next even-numbered year
is 2002, when the Olympics will be in Salt Lake City and Kwan will
have been coming to these planetary all-skates for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could bottle this motivation I had from Nationals to
here,'' the new _ and old _ world champ was saying. ``So I can open
it up for later.''

JAPAN PREMIER SUFFERS STROKE; STAND-IN NAMED
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for earlier story. The story is an added starter on Page 1.) 
 (rk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The prime minister of Japan, Keizo Obuchi, has suffered
a stroke and was temporarily relieved of his duties Monday, the
government announced.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's condition was confirmed more than 24 hours after he was
hospitalized early Sunday, complaining of exhaustion. The prime
minister was temporarily replaced as the nation's top official by
Mikio Aoki, his chief Cabinet secretary, at a hastily convened news
conference early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 9:00 a.m. today, I accepted the job of acting prime
minister in accordance with the 9th article of cabinet law,'' Aoki
said. ``When I visited Mr. Obuchi yesterday, he said that pending
the results of his medical examination that I should take over the
job of acting prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Aoki said the move was especially justified by the emergency
operations surrounding the eruption four days ago of a volcano in
the country's northernmost province, Hokkaido. Aoki said he would
convene his first Cabinet meeting later in the day, and the meeting
was expected to be dominated by the government's response to the
eruption of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   The stroke suffered by Obuchi on Sunday comes at a time of
mounting political activity in Japan in anticipation of national
elections, which must be held by October. His incapacitation, even
if it proves only short--lived, injects a major dose of drama and
uncertainty to the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's medical emergency was initially diagnosed as
``overwork'' and came on a weekend when the prime minister was both
grappling with the emergency response in the north and struggling
to keep his ruling coalition together.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the leader of the smallest member of his three-party
coalition, the Liberal Party, announced its departure from the
government after an hourlong meeting with Obuchi. Less than an hour
later, Obuchi complained of extreme fatigue and asked shortly
afterward to be taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party leader, Ichiro Ozawa, expressed surprise and
regret Monday over Obuchi's condition. ``I was extremely surprised
at the information,'' he said. ``I would never have suspected that
he would be hospitalized after the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after such a long delay in announcing the medical
emergency, the government's initial statements about the prime
minister _ emphasizing that he had gone to the hospital in a
private vehicle and not an ambulance, and asserting that he had
never lost consciousness _ seemed mostly intended to minimize the
political impact of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has once previously experienced the temporary replacement
of a prime minister. Twenty years ago, Prime Minister Masayoshi
Ohira was also replaced by his chief Cabinet secretary. Ohira
eventually died in office, throwing the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party into turmoil on the eve of elections. He was ultimately
replaced by Masayoshi Ito.
</P>
<P>
   If Obuchi is incapacitated for any substantial length of time,
pressures will rise within his Liberal Democratic Party to chose a
new standard bearer before the October elections.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has been under increasing political pressure in recent
months, as the mandatory October deadline for new national
elections approaches and many economic indicators, as well as his
government's poll ratings, deteriorate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japanese political analysts say that Obuchi had hoped to call
elections after a summit meeting of the world's leading economic
powers, the Group of Eight, to be held in the southern prefecture
of Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has reportedly been working hard at ensuring
the success of the meeting, taking part in planning and other
preparations, and visiting the prefecture last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has a history of cardiac trouble, and uses a pacemaker to
stabilize his heartbeat. According to several Japanese newspapers,
Obuchi's history of heart problems had been discussed within his
party prior to his selection as its prime ministerial candidate.
Obuchi is reported to have collapsed once, in 1997, as a result of
his heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his hospitalization, Obuchi had been through an
unusually active weekend, closely monitoring the emergency
evacuation of an area near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi and some predecessors have come under harsh criticism for
their tepid responses to past emergencies and natural disasters.
The government took several hours to respond to the country's worst
nuclear-related accident last September. And with elections due
soon, Obuchi's heavy involvement in the response to the volcanic
eruption seemed intended to avoid new criticism over the
government's ability to manage crises.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's government is by tradition extremely stingy with news
about the medical condition of officials and public figures. Other
than announcing the fact that Obuchi had suffered a stroke, the
government gave no information about its severity, or of Obuchi's
prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   The information vacuum sent the Japanese press into a
speculative frenzy, with many reporters seeking off-the-record
snippets of information from the medical staff at the hospital. On
that basis, the state broadcaster, NHK, announced shortly after
noon that Obuchi's condition was believed to be ``extremely
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why there had been such a lengthy delay before the
announcement of the prime minister's hospitalization, Aoki, who is
also the chief government spokesman, gave a somewhat
strained-sounding explanation. ``It was Sunday, and he was
undergoing examinations,'' he said. ``We were waiting to see how
things turned out. I had no other intention. I am speaking
honestly.''

CLEAVES IS FLINT-TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It's a good thing names don't break bones like
sticks and stones. Michigan State guard Mateen Cleaves would be in
traction rather than waiting to lead the Spartans (31-7) in Monday
night's national championship game against Florida (29-7).
</P>
<P>
   The senior from Flint, Mich., is a magnet for opposing fans'
insults. He is a player with an exceptional game and a checkered
past, which means he is an obvious target. Yet, some of the taunts
can get rather personal, and range from senseless to mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that fans have been chanting ``Alcoholic'' since
Cleaves was cited by police for having a beer in his car in 1998
and was charged with teammate Antonio Smith for stealing a 40-ounce
bottle of beer from a convenience store (the charges later were
dropped against Cleaves, and Smith was acquitted).
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan State beat writers say that fans even utter the
chant to Smith's mother, Frances, and some often question her
parenting skills. Others taunt Cleaves for his involvement in a
fight during a party on campus (the incident remains under
investigation after two years and Cleaves never has been charged).
</P>
<P>
   Even members of the fourth estate have taken jabs at Cleaves,
who is known for repeatedly uttering credos about hard work,
respect for everyone, and honoring God.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, after Michigan State gained the No. 1 seed in the
Midwest Regional and Cleaves spent 10 minutes saying the Spartans
need to take one game at a time, one reporter asked, ``Hey Mateen,
who taught you all those cliches?''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves said it doesn't bother him, and that was evident during
the Spartans' national semifinal game against Wisconsin, in which
he sank 9 of 11 free throws as fans taunted him each time he went
to the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't get caught up in that. I laugh at that stuff,''
said Cleaves. ``My mom gets upset, she kind of gets mad. But I
don't take it personal. Those same fans who say those things are
the first people outside the locker room shaking your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely Cleaves wouldn't be the subject of such taunts if he
weren't the prime reason Michigan State is 40 minutes from its
second national championship. Arguably the best Spartans point
guard since Magic Johnson, he averages 11.9 points and seven
assists a game, and leads a team that has held opponents to 54
points per game and 36 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some say many of the taunts have come from Michigan
State's Big Ten rivals, most notably Michigan, whose Fab Five teams
of the 1990s endured similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I went through the Scott Skiles deal that took taunting
to a new level,'' said coach Tom Izzo, referring to the former
Michigan State player who also was mired in off-court woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother Mateen as much,'' Izzo added. ``He's pretty
tough-minded. You know what I love about Mateen? We talked about
it, and I told him that if you do something wrong you've got to pay
the consequences. And sometimes the consequences linger and last a
little longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I feel more sorry for his parents and his sister. It
was tough on them at times. And yet I say that not as many people
taunted Mateen as you may think. I still think he has enough
blue-collar work ethic in him, he's egoless, and people appreciate
that about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo said he could recount only a couple of times when he
believed the opposing student section got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one game in particular when I just went down and
sat with him and kind of hung out for a while at the end of the
game,'' he said. ``But all in all, I think people have been pretty
good to Mateen.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Florida fans are likely to taunt Cleaves if he
buckles under the pressure of the Gators' full-court trapping
defense. But he said he welcomes that style to Wisconsin's
slow-paced attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wisconsin is going to take the air out of the basketball,
they're going to get back on defense, it's going to be a tough,
physical game,'' said Cleaves. ``I'm not saying it's not going to
be tough and physical against Florida, but we pretty much can get
more up and down and try to play our style of basketball.''

JAPAN PREMIER SUFFERS STROKE; STAND-IN NAMED
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for earlier story. The story is an added starter on Page 1.) 
 (rk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The prime minister of Japan, Keizo Obuchi, has suffered
a stroke and was temporarily relieved of his duties Monday, the
government announced.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's condition was confirmed more than 24 hours after he was
hospitalized early Sunday, complaining of exhaustion. The prime
minister was temporarily replaced as the nation's top official by
Mikio Aoki, his chief Cabinet secretary, at a hastily convened news
conference early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 9:00 a.m. today, I accepted the job of acting prime
minister in accordance with the 9th article of cabinet law,'' Aoki
said. ``When I visited Mr. Obuchi yesterday, he said that pending
the results of his medical examination that I should take over the
job of acting prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Aoki said the move was especially justified by the emergency
operations surrounding the eruption four days ago of a volcano in
the country's northernmost province, Hokkaido. Aoki said he would
convene his first Cabinet meeting later in the day, and the meeting
was expected to be dominated by the government's response to the
eruption of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   The stroke suffered by Obuchi on Sunday comes at a time of
mounting political activity in Japan in anticipation of national
elections, which must be held by October. His incapacitation, even
if it proves only short--lived, injects a major dose of drama and
uncertainty to the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's medical emergency was initially diagnosed as
``overwork'' and came on a weekend when the prime minister was both
grappling with the emergency response in the north and struggling
to keep his ruling coalition together.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the leader of the smallest member of his three-party
coalition, the Liberal Party, announced its departure from the
government after an hourlong meeting with Obuchi. Less than an hour
later, Obuchi complained of extreme fatigue and asked shortly
afterward to be taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party leader, Ichiro Ozawa, expressed surprise and
regret Monday over Obuchi's condition. ``I was extremely surprised
at the information,'' he said. ``I would never have suspected that
he would be hospitalized after the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Obuchi entered  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  Juntendo
University Hospital around 1 a.m. on Sunday. For reasons that have
not yet been explained, the hos- pitalization was not announced to
the public until Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Even after such a long delay in announcing the medical
emergency, the government's initial statements about the prime
minister _ emphasizing that he had gone to the hospital in a
private vehicle and not an ambulance, and asserting that he had
never lost consciousness _ seemed mostly intended to minimize the
political impact of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has once previously experienced the temporary replacement
of a prime minister. Twenty years ago, Prime Minister Masayoshi
Ohira was also replaced by his chief Cabinet secretary. Ohira
eventually died in office, throwing the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party into turmoil on the eve of elections. He was ultimately
replaced by Masayoshi Ito.
</P>
<P>
   If Obuchi is incapacitated for any substantial length of time,
pressures will rise within his Liberal Democratic Party to chose a
new standard bearer before the October elections.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has been under increasing political pressure in recent
months, as the mandatory October deadline for new national
elections approaches and many economic indicators, as well as his
government's poll ratings, deteriorate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japanese political analysts say that Obuchi had hoped to call
elections after a summit meeting of the world's leading economic
powers, the Group of Eight, to be held in the southern prefecture
of Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has reportedly been working hard at ensuring
the success of the meeting, taking part in planning and other
preparations, and visiting the prefecture last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has a history of cardiac trouble, and uses a pacemaker to
stabilize his heartbeat. According to several Japanese newspapers,
Obuchi's history of heart problems had been discussed within his
party prior to his selection as its prime ministerial candidate.
Obuchi is reported to have collapsed once, in 1997, as a result of
his heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his hospitalization, Obuchi had been through an
unusually active weekend, closely monitoring the emergency
evacuation of an area near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi and some predecessors have come under harsh criticism for
their tepid responses to past emergencies and natural disasters.
The government took several hours to respond to the country's worst
nuclear-related accident last September. And with elections due
soon, Obuchi's heavy involvement in the response to the volcanic
eruption seemed intended to avoid new criticism over the
government's ability to manage crises.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's government is by tradition extremely stingy with news
about the medical condition of officials and public figures. Other
than announcing the fact that Obuchi had suffered a stroke, the
government gave no information about its severity, or of Obuchi's
prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   The information vacuum sent the Japanese press into a
speculative frenzy, with many reporters seeking off-the-record
snippets of information from the medical staff at the hospital. On
that basis, the state broadcaster, NHK, announced shortly after
noon that Obuchi's condition was believed to be ``extremely
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why there had been such a lengthy delay before the
announcement of the prime minister's hospitalization, Aoki, who is
also the chief government spokesman, gave a somewhat
strained-sounding explanation. ``It was Sunday, and he was
undergoing examinations,'' he said. ``We were waiting to see how
things turned out. I had no other intention. I am speaking
honestly.''

RED CARPET FOR JUNIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ In the rest of America and the world, today is
Monday. But here, in baseball's homeland and heartland, this day is
known as it has been known for generations, known by Cincinnati's
two sweetest words.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   A semi-holiday, a day almost holy for the city with baseball's
oldest franchise, a day where truly all is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Especially this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. returns to his home city, 13 years after leaving
Moeller High School as a troubled teenager, 13 years after leaving
with three words in his name and returning home with sports'
highest accolade of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   One name.
</P>
<P>
   Just like ``Michael,'' and ``Larry,'' and ``Magic,'' and
``Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   One name explains all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky Airport across the Ohio
River in Kentucky, the huge sign welcoming Griffey home is merely
the precursor to an amazing phenomenon, this ``Juniorizing'' of
baseball's senior team in the senior circuit in one of America's
senior cities. Meanwhile, ``Senior'' himself looks on, father and
son reunited, a link from the first (and real) Big Red Machine of
the mid-1970s to this next (but only potential) Big Red Machine of
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And today _ not Monday, but Opening Day _ is when reality begins
to test The Phenomenon of Junior Returning Home. Heavier loads
seldom have been placed on anyone's shoulders in baseball than what
is expected from Junior in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain fell on Cincinnati Sunday, buckets and buckets, and
more is possible for Sunday's game against the Brewers. A
suggestion, perhaps, that reality might include a few more clouds
than the endless blue skies in winter and through spring training
of The Phenomenon of Junior Returning Home.
</P>
<P>
   The Phenomenon. In Cincinnati, the deal that brought Junior from
Seattle already has been described as baseball's biggest since the
Red Sox sent Babe Ruth to the Yankees 80 years ago. Well, at the
time of the infamous Sox deal, Ruth was five years younger than
Junior was when he asked out of Seattle. Not to mention, Ruth
already had helped the Red Sox to World Series titles, while Junior
has yet to be ``Mr. October,'' having one very good series against
the Yankees in his first postseason action and being only average
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The Phenomenon. In an earlier _ but smaller _ phenomenon, when
Eric Davis came to the Reds, he was supposed to be the next Willie
Mays. He was not. It is open to debate if even Griffey is another
Willie Mays, but the media monster now is so huge, so many sound
bites, so many stories, so much hyperbole, that before a game is
even played _ a game in April, mind you _ the ultimate comparison
is placed on Griffey's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Another Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Reds general manager Jim Bowden has pulled off some good trades
(pitcher Dave Burba to the Indians for first baseman Sean Casey)
and a stinker or two (Paul O'Neill to the Yankees for Roberto
Kelly). But this deal bringing Junior home is Bowden's proudest
moment, as it should be; Bowden sees the deal on par with the
Yankees stealing Ruth from the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But what the deal unleashed is truly amazing. Virtually every
detail of Griffey's life has been recapitulated in Cincinnati, and
the life of his father, and even the life of his grandfather, who
some thought was on par with a player he used to play with on the
sandlots, the most famous ballplayer ever to come out of Donora,
Pa., Stan Musial. But Junior's grandfather and Senior's father had
no chance to prove it in the early 1940s, with blacks still being
kept out of baseball then.
</P>
<P>
   No Red Sox fan can forget the 1975 World Series or how
outstanding that Big Red Machine was, and how superlative a player
Senior was. Sometimes Senior would bring Junior to the park (the
Reds didn't allow players' children in the locker room after a
loss), but not too often. Still in all, by 1987, when Junior was
17, the Mariners had chosen him as the first player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a few months later, just after turning 18, Junior had
swallowed 277 aspirin in a suicide attempt. As the Cincinnati Post
has quoted Junior of the angst, ``It seemed everyone was yelling at
me in baseball, then I came home and everyone was yelling at me
there. I got depressed. I got angry. I didn't want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, in 1990, Junior was in the big leagues with
Seattle and immediately named to the American League All-Star team.
Ever since, he has been a sports highlight show celebrity, climbing
fences to snag would-be homers, running the bases, and hitting
those laser shots into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   But Junior never could lead the Mariners to the ultimate. The
pitching-poor and bullpen-deprived team had its problems, but
Junior also was not Mr. October.
</P>
<P>
   But now The Phenomenon is promising all. Bowden also has
acquired Dante Bichette, and with Casey and Bichette sandwiching
him in the lineup, Junior will not be pitched around. But that was
also the case in Seattle, when the Mariners had Edgar Martinez, Jay
Buhner, and many other bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Phenomenon has been created by that media monster, hinting
that the Reds will be the Reds of the 1970s and Junior will be
Reggie Jackson, swatting homer after homer in countless World
Series. The Phenomenon notes that seldom, if ever, has one division
had such sluggers as the National League's Central. Yet, even with
Mark McGwire's homers, the Cardinals were forgettable last season
and so were the Cubs, even with Sammy Sosa's blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, athletes were judged after their careers.
Those who grew up in the 1940s and 1950s never heard anyone put in
the same breath as Babe Ruth; it was not until Hank Aaron
approached and then broke Ruth's sacred number of 714 homers that
even he was paired with Ruth. Yet The Phenomenon of Junior
Returning Home mates the two.
</P>
<P>
   The modern media creates so much expectation before a game,
before an event, before a season, before a career. It is so unfair.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to wait. And merely enjoy watching what a great
player can or cannot accomplish.

JUNIOR'S VICTORY RESCUED A DRAG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sitting in a luxury box, high above his
far-north Fort Worth empire, Bruton Smith was barking postrace
orders, via walkie-talkie, to the hired help down below in Victory
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell 'em, I changed my mind,'' said the
man-who-would-be-NASCAR-king-if-only ...
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the NASCAR honchos don't listen all that much to the
outspoken Mr. Smith. They hear, but they don't listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out a \Rmedia\S release,'' added Smith on the
walkie-talkie. ``I want to be quoted that I changed my mind _
racing is not boring anymore. Not after today, and last week at
Bristol.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so darn fast there, Bruton. Let's talk about this.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that comment can stand as Smith's opinion on the
DirecTV 500 at his Texas Motor Speedway showplace. And among the
223,000 who watched yesterday afternoon under heavy-yet-dry clouds,
maybe there wouldn't be much disagreement. Fan loyalty to the whole
NASCAR scene is legendary, plus an Earnhardt won this race, even if
it was the rookie son of the beloved No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of free packs of cigarettes and a personal scanner,
nothing seems to please the NASCAR hordes more than an Earnhardt
roaring home under the checkered flag. Dale Jr.'s win appeared to
be every bit as popular in the massive grandstand as if it had been
dear ol' dad himself.
</P>
<P>
   But several weeks ago, it was Smith, among several, who stuck
his sport with the ``boring'' tag, stirring up NASCAR officials and
some drivers. To be honest, the DirecTV 500 didn't really change
that perception, whether it be true or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little E'' won, because as Junior put it so well, ``We were
hauling butt from the first lap.'' His Budweiser Chevy led for 106
of the 334 laps, nearly twice as many as Rusty Wallace, who was in
front for 58 laps and finished fourth overall.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't exactly an afternoon of pedal-to-the-floor for
anyone. The yellow flag kept waving, and very fast cars spent far
too much time creeping around the track while cleanup crews and
wreckers took care of the mess. There were no serious wrecks, just
a lot of wall-banging and a lot of crunched fenders and hoods.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 cautions were a high for the four years of Winston Cup
racing at TMS and a high for the NASCAR circuit this season. There
were 62 laps run under yellow, reducing this 500-mile spin to a
race without a lot of substance and form. The purists could
appreciate the strategy involved in pitting under yellow in trying
to establish an advantage under green. But for the rest of us,
well, we're not that bored yet. Personally, I vow to never complain
again about how an American League baseball game drags. Not after
three hours and 49 minutes of ho-hum action yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, however, the scene in Victory Lane was special.
Big Dale, who finished seventh, jumped out of No. 3 after parking
it right next to the winner's circle, and then awaited the arrival
of Junior, whose car is owned by dad. ``The Intimidator'' was no
where to be seen. Instead, Big Dale was a proud and happy father as
he climbed into the driver's side window to hug his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he loved me,'' Dale Jr. said, ``and he wanted to
make sure I took the time to enjoy this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, young Earnhardt drew a laugh in the media room when he
said of his father, ``He was pretty happy all right, but I don't
know if he was just putting it on for you guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, the TMS general manager who along with Bruton
Smith weathered two years of driver storms over the track layout,
wasn't ``putting on'' anything with his postrace happiness. Too
many yellow flags? So what. Some serious traffic problems outside
TMS, meaning Fort Worth keeps the title of the NASCAR track with
the worst gridlock on race day? Yes, that's true, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with Little E winning, it makes everything else moot,''
Gossage said. ``When Dale Earnhardt Jr. wins his first \RWinston
Cup\S race here, that means, in the eyes of our fans, that we can
do no wrong. Years from now, our fans will be saying they were
there the day Dale Jr. won the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage asked for forgiveness for the muddy conditions in the
TMS parking lots that are unpaved. ``The heavy rains \RSaturday\S
didn't cause us to lose any parking, but it made getting into many
of our lots go very slow, and that led to a traffic slowdown on the
roadways. I regret all that. On a scale of 10, with Dale Jr.
winning, this day would have been a 10. But due to traffic, I'll
make it about a 61/2 or 7.''
</P>
<P>
   For a promoter like Gossage, that's showing plenty of caution.
Then again, it kind of fit the theme of the day. Nothing moved as
fast as everyone would have liked, unless, of course, your name was
Dale Earnhardt Jr.

ASHCROFT TAKES A MORE MODERATE COURSE IN RE-ELECTION BID 
</HEADLINE>
 BC-  KC-ASH-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY and STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years ago, when John Ashcroft thought about
running for president, he declared that it was time to ``unfurl the
banner of unabashed conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ashcroft is waving a different banner _ one that
signals a more moderate agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a battle for re-election against Democrat Mel
Carnahan, Ashcroft's focus has shifted to voters in the middle of
the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of touting the $4 trillion, 10-year tax cut that he
unveiled during his exploratory presidential run, Ashcroft now is
almost mum on the topic. Instead of saying he would use Social
Security surpluses to cut taxes, Ashcroft has changed course and
now wants to leave the surpluses alone.
</P>
<P>
   And he recently lost his two-year distinction as the most
conservative senator in a well-known annual ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft puts little stock in assertions he has drifted to the
center to have a better chance of defeating Carnahan in Missouri's
high-profile Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I think Missourians know the kind of conservative I've
been,'' Ashcroft said. ``These issues I'm focusing on for Missouri
are the same themes I was focusing on before.''
</P>
<P>
   A shift from conservative to moderate would hardly be unusual.
It comes straight out of political textbooks that advise candidates
to move right or left in the primaries, then back to the middle for
the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's trend toward the center is difficult to miss based on
a review of his voting record, public statements and media
releases. Political scholars have noted the same shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would lose to Mel Carnahan if he continued to push a real
right-wing agenda,'' St. Louis University political scientist Ken
Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Virginia, political scientist Larry Sabato
noted that Carnahan and Ashcroft both are moving to the center,
though Ashcroft has further to travel.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate, Ashcroft was viewed as a ``hard
right'' conservative who was seeking to win over such right-wing
leaders as Pat Robertson, Sabato said. ``He was seen as one of the
two or three favorites of the Christian right.''
</P>
<P>
   A top Carnahan aide said Ashcroft's shift is transparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is running away from his record in a wholesale fashion,''
Marc Farinella said
</P>
<P>
   According to Farinella, the most notable example involves
Ashcroft's 1998 call for a tax cut of $1.7 trillion over five years
and $4 trillion over 10 years. Likely 2000 GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush is proposing a smaller cut of $1.3 trillion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said he still supports major elements of his tax-cut
plan, although he no longer gives it a $4 trillion price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I favor very substantial tax relief for the American people,''
he said. ``I'm not sure the menu would be exactly the same. Some of
those things have already been undertaken.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Congress is working on Ashcroft's proposal to
eliminate the marriage tax penalty.
</P>
<P>
   On the highly sensitive issue of Social Security, Ashcroft said
in December 1997 that surpluses should be used for tax relief.
Fifteen months later, after deciding to focus on his Senate race,
he sponsored a bill for a ``lockbox'' to keep the surplus intact.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft spokesman Steve Hilton said the only other choice in
1997 was to use the surplus for spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Farinella said that Ashcroft ``cannot both cut taxes by $4
trillion and at the same time promise people he's going to protect
Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton called that a ``political lie.... The proposal was fully
paid for with reductions and reforms in government with a minor
share from the non-Social Security surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton acknowledged that the senator's tax cut was financed, in
part, through savings on Medicare and other entitlements. Social
Security, however, would have been unaffected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some issues boil down to a difference over what constitutes a
shift to the middle.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on plans to help senior citizens pay for
prescription drugs, Ashcroft in 1999 voted twice against proposals
aimed at furthering that goal. In news releases and public
appearances, Ashcroft now expresses an interest in expanding drug
coverage for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   But Hilton said Republicans voted against the drug plans because
they were waiting for President Clinton to take the lead on saving
Medicare. Since that has not happened, ``It's time to proceed,''
Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   On Medicare, Ashcroft voted in 1997 to increase the eligibility
age from 65 to 67 and has, over several years, voted for many
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton said the eligibility adjustment amounted to a gradual
rise and makes Medicare conform to the Social Security age
schedule. The senator's votes to cut the rate of Medicare's growth
were aimed at saving the program from bankruptcy, and in some cases
preserving GOP tax cuts, Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   In overall tone, there's little doubt that Ashcroft has adjusted
his public demeanor. As a presidential contender, Ashcroft focused
on such conservative issues as abortion, flag desecration and
prohibiting federal testing of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ashcroft focuses on more centrist proposals, such as making
air bags safer and ending the earnings test for Social Security
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is considered one of the Senate's most conservative
members, a point he emphasized during his presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 radio interview, Ashcroft said, ``There are two things
you find in the middle of the road: a moderate and a dead skunk.
And I don't want to be either one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point that year, Ashcroft spoke of Republicans ``who
preach pragmatism, who champion conciliation, who counsel
compromise.'' Then he added, ``I stand here to reject those lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he stood by those remarks: ``I'm certainly not going
to support lies, I'm going to fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 rating by the National Journal that covered 50 votes
on a variety of policy issues, Ashcroft tied for first with six
senators for the most conservative ranking. In 1998, he rated 94
percent, tied for first with two others. But in 1999, he dropped to
a tie for 15th with 83.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relative to his colleagues, he's drifted,'' said Gideon
Berger, the Journal's associate editor.
</P>
<P>
   One example from the Journal: In 1999 Ashcroft voted to retain a
law requiring background checks to buy guns at pawnshops.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said dozens of groups do rankings, and ``I doubt you'll
find uniformity in rating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   While still exploring a presidential bid, Ashcroft displayed his
conservative stripes when he became one of the first senators to
call for Clinton's resignation after it became clear the president
had lied about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said I wouldn't want to forgive the president,''
Ashcroft said last week, although he still believes the president
was irresponsible. ``I don't have any intention to not work with
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, Ashcroft co-sponsored a proposed constitutional
amendment in 1998 that would outlaw it, even in cases of rape or
incest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been my philosophy during my time in government,''
Ashcroft said. He's no longer pressing the amendment, but has
helped pass other anti-abortion measures.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann of the conservative Heritage Foundation said
Ashcroft hasn't changed his views since his presidential run, but
was now ``broadening his portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Wittmann said, ``You have different constituencies when
you run for president than when you represent a state.''

YANKEES' RIVERA EXPECTS LONG-TERM CONTRACT SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By   BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mariano Rivera, the New York Yankees' closer,
said Sunday that he was hopeful of reaching agreement on a
long-term contract shortly into the season, after negotiations
cannot be complicated by the luxury tax. ``I think we could get
something done,'' he said. ``I'm not looking to get all the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are not negotiating with Rivera, who is the game's
best closer, but there was not a large divide in the proposals
passed between the two sides before the Feb. 17 arbitration
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing, the Yankees had offered Rivera a four-year,
$36 million contract, according to people familiar with the
negotiations. Just as the case was about to be heard, Rivera's
agent offered four proposals with suggested packages of $37.5
million, $38 million, $38.5 million and $39 million. Under the
$37.5 million proposal, the reliever's base salary would have
increased by $750,000 if he had won the Rolaids award as the top
reliever, and there were similar bonuses attached to the other
packages as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera lost his case and will earn $7.25 million this year,
rather than the $9.25 million for which he asked. Rivera and
shortstop Derek Jeter will be eligible for free agency after the
2001 season. Jeter, whose agent negotiated a seven-year, $118.5
million deal that never got final approval from the principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, said he knew of no progress toward
completing any contract. ``It's not up to me,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Johnson, the former Mets outfielder, was added to the
Yankees' major league roster Sunday as the team made its final
moves in preparation for Monday's season opener against the Angels.
Johnson, 36, agreed to a one-year deal worth $350,000, and he will
be used primarily as a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance is very excited about the chance to be with the
Yankees,'' said Phil Tannenbaum, his agent. Johnson was expected to
arrive here this evening and perhaps participate in a workout at
the Angels' Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will open the season using Jim Leyritz as their
backup catcher, behind Jorge Posada; six outfielders, including
Johnson and Roberto Kelly as bench players; six infielders,
including Clay Bellinger and the newly acquired Wilson Delgado; and
11 pitchers _ the opening day starter, Orlando Hernandez, and Roger
Clemens, David Cone, Andy Pettitte, Ramiro Mendoza, Mariano Rivera,
Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson, Allen Watson, Jason Grimsley and Todd
Erdos.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees designated pitcher Mike Buddie for assignment and
have 10 days to trade him or pass him through waivers. They also
optioned pitcher Darrell Einertson to Triple-A Columbus and
reassigned infielder Jon Zuber, outfielder Felix Jose, pitcher
Domingo Jean and catcher Chris Turner to Triple-A. &QL;

POLITICS CLAIMS A GROWING SHARE OF CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- KC-Net-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget what Dan Rather thinks you need to know about the 2000
campaign. No longer must you endure the know-it-all tone of
Newsweek or Time or U.S. News &AMP; World Report. Nor must you settle
for the editorial choices of your daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   You have the Internet to soothe your civic desires.
</P>
<P>
   It makes bankrolling a candidate as easy as ordering a
bestseller. It lets you lobby Capitol Hill from your den. In
Arizona, residents have cast votes online.
</P>
<P>
   Want to play politics? Just click your mouse. Assuming, of
course, you're interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people would rather be watching wrestling or going to a
wrestling Web site than using the Internet to see something about a
candidate,'' said Rachel Gorlin of the Washington-based Laguens
Hamburger Stone political consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some of the people who watch wrestling also vote. And some
of those people like to get their information about politics off
the Internet. And they will only go there more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   Even political professionals who dismissed the importance of
cyberspace in past campaigns say that for both candidate and voter
it reaches a new significance in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In quantity, quality and ease of use, the Internet has evolved
into a tool that makes it far more convenient for anyone with a
modem to play politics.
</P>
<P>
   For the voter, there's a nearly endless array of Web sites that
compare candidate records on greenhouse gas emissions, foreign
trade or U.S. policy toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   It can tell you what candidates will appear on your ballot,
which agree most with you, who pays for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   There is some evidence that voters want that information. Tens
of thousands of people have registered online to vote through
Project Vote Smart, a nonprofit group run largely with money from
foundations and volunteers on a Montana ranch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, its www.vote-smart.org drew nearly 1 million hits on
Election Day. (For all this high technology, comparing the
popularity of Web sites is rather crude. Hits measure how many
times a Web page has been called up without revealing how many
different people looked at it or how many are repeat visitors.)
This year, well before the general election, the site records about
1.5 million hits almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those calling a companion hotline (1-888-VOTE-SMART, or
1-888-8683-76278) want to know where candidates stand on the
issues. Those calling and visiting the Web site are mostly young _
about 70 percent are 25 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hear about us through MTV or Rosie O'Donnell and they
come,'' said Richard Kimball, the director of Project Vote Smart.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web also offers voters a chance to soak up a
candidate's message firsthand _ free of the editing of traditional
media or even the analysis of new Internet-based political referees
like Project Vote Smart.
</P>
<P>
   Since the television watcher differs from Internet wanderer _
politics is thrust at the couch potato, the person online must
search it out _ academics and political operatives alike say the
new technology could be a force for electoral good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because voters go to a political Web site with interest,
campaigns need to make sure what they put up is specific and
relevant,'' said Kathryn Coombs of Washington Web Works, a firm
that helps Republican candidates navigate the Internet. ``You can't
get by with vague images the way you might in a TV spot.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Internet remains a political novelty _ more a
roadside attraction on the campaign trail than a critical
crossroads. The people politicians hire to run their campaigns
still advise spending far more on television advertising than on
Web design.
</P>
<P>
   It's the nature of the medium. Television brings politics to the
normal voter, the sort who tunes into campaigns reluctantly in
30-second intervals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet can't do what television does, which is to reach
out to people when they're thinking about something else _
`Friends,' `The Simpsons,' `The Sopranos' _ and get them to think
about politics,'' said Bruce Bimber. He is director of the Center
for Information Technology and Society at the University of
California, Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet still is a preaching-to-the-choir medium,'' he
said. ``Research suggests that the Internet does not stimulate
people to vote who otherwise would not vote....It tends to be
people who are well-informed and already interested.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the exception to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Americans tend to use the Internet for things other than
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., ranked the top 23
things Internet users do online. Most send e-mail. Roughly half go
shopping or researching their purchases or looking for weather
reports. A quarter to a fifth play games, play the stock market or
linger in chat rooms. One in seven wants pornography. Politics
didn't make the list.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to campaigns crafting a place where voters log on early and
often, the net can mean the difference at the margins of a tight
race.
</P>
<P>
   Politics Online flatly declares Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura
``the first candidate that would not have won without the
Internet.'' His surprise win in 1998 has been widely attributed to
the way his campaign mobilized voters through e-mail and a
relatively primitive Web site before he raised enough cash for
television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain used the Internet another way. He built his
presidential campaign by advertising and using his personality to
draw attention from journalists. Then, having won the New Hampshire
primary, he used his Web site to convert momentum to money.
</P>
<P>
   He raised $20,000 on the Web site in the hour after his New
Hampshire victory was announced, $1 million in the first 48 hours
and $2 million in a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other candidates had done well in New Hampshire in past years
but could never capitalize on it to get the money in time to keep
their campaigns afloat,'' said Tracy Westen, chairman of
Grassroots.com and a government professor at the University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was fast money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Web sites are the new darlings of political
fund-raisers. Where ordinary methods of mailing out letters asking
for donations can mean spending $25 to raise $26, Web sites promise
bigger returns on smaller investments. They also tend to draw money
from first-time donors, the hardest contributors to find.
</P>
<P>
   People like Eric Johnson, chief executive officer of
Campaignoffice.com, offer customized Web sites for as little as
$250. For $1,500 his outfit supplies a campaign with a Web site
that will take credit-card donations, organize volunteers and post
campaign commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost political malpractice not to raise money and
recruit volunteers there,'' Johnson said. ``(But) the verdict is
still out on whether the Internet will transform politics in the
way TV transformed politics in the '60s.''

ABROSIMOVA PERSEVERED TO CLIMB TO THE TOP
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Being from St. Petersburg, Russia, home of the
Hermitage, Svetlana Abrosimova would not bother sending videotapes
home unless her games were of museum quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only send tapes when I play well,'' Abrosimova said. ``My
mom thinks I'm the greatest ever.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been little reason for her mother to change her
opinion this year as Abrosimova enjoyed another all-American season
and agreed to a sort of detente with Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma.
</P>
<P>
   If they made a movie of Abrosimova's career at UConn, it might
be called, ``From Russia With Tough Love.'' Auriemma has generally
been the coaching equivalent of Nikita Khrushchev, banging his shoe
on the table (albeit a shoe he has a contract to endorse), claiming
that Abrosimova wasn't tough enough or enough of a team player,
especially in big games.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far has our relationship come?'' Auriemma said before
Sunday night's national championship game against Tennessee.
``Well, our relationship was the best when she was in Russia, and I
talked to her on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship is no different from the relationship he has
with all his star players, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like any of them, because they are never as good as I
think they can be,'' Auriemma said. ``So we're always arguing about
how to do things better. Then after they graduate, I tell everybody
that was the best player I ever coached.''
</P>
<P>
   In Abrosimova's case, it might be true. The 6-foot-2-inch
forward scored 25 points in the East Regional final and was named
the most valuable player. Then she chipped in 14 points, 10
rebounds, four assists and a steal in the national semifinals. She
has spent her career like a self-assured quarterback trying to
persuade her coach that she can throw into triple coverage. This
year, for the first time, she finished with more assists than
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Svet plays the way she can, I don't think there's many
people that can do as many things as well as she can _ shoot the
three, get to the basket and rebound,'' Auriemma said. ``She's
learning to play with other great players.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova was born nearly 20 years ago, when St. Petersburg was
called Leningrad, and sport was a way to promote state propaganda
in the Soviet Union. Like thousands of other kids, she was selected
to play basketball at age 7 because she was tall. By 10, she said,
her mother, Lyudmila, had put a basket up in the family apartment.
The women's game is not particularly popular in Russia, though. Her
high school championship game drew 150 people, Abrosimova said, so
she decided that the future of her game and her education rested in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived three years ago in Storrs, Conn., confident about
her basketball but not her English. When she spoke, she put her
head down and avoided looking others in the eye. But few people
know more about persevering than natives of St. Petersburg. The
city survived despite being surrounded by the Germans for 900 days
during World War II. Her aunt and grandmother told her stories
about the siege, Abrosimova said, ``about how they got through a
lot of tough things.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to that, learning English did not seem so
insurmountable. She used tutors to help with her class work, and
her English skills blossomed with her basketball skills.
</P>
<P>
   She does put her foot down, though, at country music, a favorite
of teammate Shea Ralph's. ``If they make me listen to country
music, the next day they've got to listen to Russian music,''
Abrosimova said.
</P>
<P>
   She has a great Russian sense of humor, and once, when asked if
she was nervous, told Auriemma that she had calmed her nerves by
imagining everyone in the arena naked. ``But not you, coach,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, her parents worry about her safety, knowing
that Russian gangs have tried to extort some of the country's most
visible athletes. ``I'm just a poor college student,'' she said.
``I don't have millions.''

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Astros are so happy in their new downtown home that even when
nobody could figure out a way to turn the Enron Field lights on for
practice Sunday, nary a grumble was heard. Craig Biggio kept right
on taking his extra BP in the gloomy gloaming, prompting trainer
Dave Labossiere to make an observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to simulate conditions in Pittsburgh,'' he
said. ``It's always like this there.''
</P>
<P>
   And as it happens, it figures to be again tonight, when the
Astros venture back into the cold, cruel world to begin their first
season of the new millennium. There will be no trendy retractable
roof to shelter the teams from the elements, meaning opening night
could well be delayed until Tuesday. Today's forecast for Western
Pennsylvania, where spring hasn't fully sprung yet, says rain is a
virtual certainty and a raw breeze a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the weather, however, the three games in Three Rivers
Stadium, another of the doomed cookie-cutter parks we in Houston
can now sniff derisively at, are fraught with peril. The low-budget
Pirates are the sleeper team in the National League Central because
their top three starting pitchers might be the most collectively
troublesome trio in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Schmidt throws consistently in the mid-90s, Kris Benson
was clocked as high as 98 during the spring, and Francisco Cordova,
the staff ace three years ago when Pittsburgh dogged the Astros'
heels into the final week of the season, has historically made life
difficult for Houston. Granted, bellwethers Jeff Bagwell and Biggio
have handled Schmidt, who opposes Shane Reynolds in the opener
whenever it takes place, with a measure of consistency. But they
are a combined 10-for-76 (.132) against the other two guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hits might be hard to come by,'' Bagwell conceded.
``That's a tough place for us to start the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly under these circumstances, with the Pirates series
stuck between the gloriously giddy unveiling of Enron and the first
for-keeps games there against the Phillies beginning Friday night.
There figures to be scant electricity in Pittsburgh, where baseball
will remain moribund at least until the Pirates' own new old park
is ready, and therefore the Astros have to be extremely vigilant
about keeping their emotional edge.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, speaking for the team, promised as much. But as manager
Larry Dierker would say later on Sunday, ``It's one thing to think
you're ready _ and we do _ but you have to go out and prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dierker is of the opinion that the magic of the
previous three days should send the Astros into the regular season,
their dismal destination at the outset notwithstanding, on a crest
of euphoria. The atmosphere for the two Yankees games in particular
was playoff-like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Night baseball in front of big crowds is a lot more
stimulating than day baseball in front of little crowds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dierker, entering his fourth season as manager, has
already claimed one more division title than all other Houston
skippers combined _ three vs. two _ we must give such
pronouncements of his a certain weight. And it's clear the Astros
need any edge they can finagle if they are to extend Dierker's
Central winning streak to 4-for-4, because the once-puny division
has evolved into a nasty brute.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros could finish third or fourth playing as well as they
did to finish first three seasons ago, when 84-78 was a good enough
record to outlast a Pirates team that, as a group, was paid
significantly less than the ``bargain'' $12.5 million Ken Griffey
Jr. will be making by his lonesome with the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Enron factor itself then looms large, with sellouts and near
sellouts to become regular occurrences. Assuming the Astros fit
nicely into the park, and so far there's no reason to believe they
won't, the pumped-up energy level alone could be worth a couple of
extra victories over 81 home dates. Having nosed past Cincinnati by
only 1{ games last season with Griffey still a Mariner, the Astros
couldn't have been transformed into the hottest ticket in town at a
more fortuitous juncture.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic the Astros aren't opening at home, given the Taj
Mahal that home for them has become. Since 1982, the Astros have
been sent on the road for their first game only once, although the
1995 season also kicked off in San Diego because of how the
strike-shortened schedule broke.
</P>
<P>
   But the feeling was that Enron Field's contractors badly needed
the four-day shakeout to problem-solve after the three-game trial
run. And they most definitely do. While the lights aren't a problem
_ it's just that nobody with the Astros who happened to be present
at the start of Sunday's practice knew the secret code necessary
for turning them on _ plenty of little bugs abound.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them the literal kind. Mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   As per Houston's reputation for an overabundance of same, they
have already proved to be a major nuisance at Enron. Richard
Hidalgo, for one, wouldn't take the field to shag flies until he
had ferreted out a can of repellent and sprayed his arms until they
glistened. Never mind the closed roof above him. He was already
covered with welts.
</P>
<P>
   At least there won't be any biting insects awaiting the Astros
in Pittsburgh. Too cold.

ONE MORE POOR TEAM WINDS UP AS FODDER FOR DEVILS

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The Devils have stayed on top of their division by
feasting on the weaker teams in the league and they did it again
Sunday night, overwhelming the Tampa Bay Lightning, 4-1, at the Ice
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The victory against the league's second-worst team extended the
Devils' lead in the Atlantic Division to four points over the
Flyers, who lost to the Carolina Hurricanes Sunday afternoon. It
also made the Devils the first team in the Eastern Conference to
surpass 100 points; they have 101.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they win their final three games, though, they cannot
hope to catch the St. Louis Blues in the race for the President's
Trophy, which is given to the team with the most points. The Blues
have 111 points after their victory Sunday afternoon over the
Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   By beating the Lightning, the Devils are 3-2-0 since Larry
Robinson replaced Robbie Ftorek as coach. The two losses have come
against Toronto and Pittsburgh, teams the Devils could meet down
the road in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The victory Sunday came just two days after they routed the
league's worst team, the Atlanta Thrashers. But it was the first
time in 15 games that they have won two in a row, and it was only
their sixth victory in those 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for the Devils is that they have only one
victory in the last six weeks against a team with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils can boost their confidence, though, if they can win
in their visit to the Florida Panthers on Monday night, a game in
which some Devils expect to see retribution from the Panthers for
Scott Niedermayer's stick hit to Peter Worrell's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer will serve the seventh game in his 10-game
suspension against the Panthers on Monday and his ninth when the
Panthers visit New Jersey on Saturday for the last game of the
regular season for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had little difficulty against the Lightning, which
entered the game with three victories in its last 17 games but had
beat the Devils on March 17. Sunday night, the Devils scored two
power-play goals 70 seconds apart in the first six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias opened the scoring during a two-man advantage 4
minutes 6 seconds into the game with his 34th goal, leading the
team. Standing at Zac Bierk's right doorstep, Elias converted Petr
Sykora's pass from the right side, culminating a play that was
started by Brian Rafalski.
</P>
<P>
   With the Devils setting up camp in Tampa Bay's zone, Vladimir
Malakhov's first goal of the season gave the Devils a two-goal lead
thanks to hard work by Randy McKay in a crowd in front of Bierk,
the sixth goaltender used by Tampa Bay this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' domination in the first period was also translated
into Scott Stevens' eighth goal of the season, a blast from the
left circle in the 12th minute, after a good pass from behind the
goal by Sergei Brylin.
</P>
<P>
   So dominant were the Devils in the first period that the
Lightning had its first attempt at Martin Brodeur in the ninth
minute. The only difficult save Brodeur made in the first two
periods was on a one-timer from the right circle by Steve Martins.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur had a couple of crucial moments in the third period
during a penalty to Rafalski before Elias scored his second of the
night with 7:26 left in the game. Brodeur lost his bid for a second
consecutive shutout with about three minutes left when Fredrik
Modin beat him from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who tied Terry Sawchuk for the most victories over a
five-year span, with 195, improved to 18-4-2 against Tampa Bay. The
Devils lead the series between the teams, 25-6-4.

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ The pundits claim guard play is the key to success
in the NCAA Tournament.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What they really mean is point-guard play.
</P>
<P>
   Whether quick like Isiah Thomas, heady like Bobby Hurley or
all-around dominant like Magic Johnson, if your point guard gets
the job done, you can win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   For Michigan State (31-7), which plays Florida (29-7) for the
national title tonight at the RCA Dome, the point guard is even
more important to the Spartans' cause. With Florida bent on
pressing, trapping and harassing its foes with its pressure
defense, protecting the ball is a necessity to beat the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   The ball _ and some say Michigan State's fortunes _ will be in
Mateen Cleaves' hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans' senior point guard wouldn't have it any other way.
He believes he was born to be a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can make a leader,'' Cleaves said. ``A
leader is born. You've got to have confidence in yourself because
all eyes are going to be on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates credit Cleaves' halftime outburst against Syracuse for
righting the team's ship and helping the Spartans to a
come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   How he handles the Gators' press will dictate how the rest of
the team handles it. Cleaves knows he sets the pace for the team _
on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the leader, you have to be the hardest worker also,''
Cleaves said. ``I can't go out there, not work hard and then get on
someone else for not working hard. I need myself as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I can say, `If I'm out here an hour before practice and an
hour after practice working out, then why aren't you? If I'm out
here diving on the floor for loose balls, then why can't you?'''
</P>
<P>
   It is that attitude that makes Cleaves so important to the
Spartans. Whether he plays well or not, Cleaves feels he controls
the show. Even when he does not play well, he seems to will the
Spartans to victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida is not the kind of team that succumbs to will.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators score points in bunches. A poor stretch from Cleaves
and the Spartans could result in a quick 10- to 15-point burst by
the Gators. Many times that could mean the game is all but over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida really concerns me,'' Cleaves said. ``They score fast
and have great athletes that get up and down the floor. We can't
play in spurts like we have in some of our previous games or it
will be a long night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans said they lean on Cleaves to keep that from
happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one of the best guards in the country in the open
floor,'' forward Andre Hutson said. ``(Florida's style) gives him a
chance to make some of those open-floor plays. Their press is going
to make us try to do some things that we wouldn't normally do, like
take quick shots. So we have to really focus on taking what they
give us. We've had a lot of success against teams that press, but
we have to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to pick and choose situations in which to take
chances,'' Cleaves said. ``If you go up and down the floor three or
four times without a basket, then you have to slow it down. I've
matured a lot over the years and know when to slow it down and when
to push it. The key is to put other guys in position to make
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   While Cleaves will be called on to handle most of the Spartans'
ball-handling, shooting guard Charlie Bell and small forward Morris
Peterson are capable ball-handlers as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Cleaves was out for the first 12 games of the season with a
stress fracture in his foot, Bell moved to the point and did a
solid job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to face pressing teams, and I feel confident in my
ball-handling,'' Bell said. ``I'm not worried about it. If we
maintain our composure, we can break it. We've beaten teams who
press. If we get it past guys and into the open court, we can get
shots in transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mateen is going to need a lot of help. One guy can't beat a
press; it is going to take the whole team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves averages just under four turnovers per game, but he
offsets that with an average of seven assists a contest. The
Spartans turn the ball over 14.6 times a game; Florida forces
nearly 20 miscues a game.
</P>
<P>
   In Peterson, Michigan State has a wingman who can finish the
break. And in Hutson, the Spartans have a post man who runs the
floor well and can even dribble the ball up in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   That versatility will make it difficult for Florida to sustain
its pressure without giving up easy baskets.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gators are not only trying to speed up the tempo and
create turnovers with their press. They play 10 players, and they
expect to wear their opponent down by game's end.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is what many believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the media helps in talking about the press; other
teams let it get to them mentally,'' Florida forward Brent Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves touched on that point as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of scares you, but we're just going to have to fight
through (fatigue),'' he said. ``This is the last game, and it's for
all the marbles. A lot of wearing down is in your mind. You have to
have inner toughness to fight through it.''
</P>
<P>
   If at some point tonight the Spartans are in trouble and fatigue
is setting in, they will look to Cleaves to provide the spark for
them to fight through it. That's the point guard's job.
</P>
<P>
   If Cleaves wants his name listed among the great point guards in
NCAA Tournament history, this is when he will have to come through.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Monday night is about,'' Cleaves said. ``I'm not a
guy to get caught up in individual stats or individual honors, but
I want our team to be known as national champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to leave a legacy or anything of that sort, you go
out there and win. The name of the game is to win. If you win,
people will always respect you. That's in life or whatever. If
you're a successful person, people will always respect you.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ Even if you've never been to Gainesville, you
probably know about the image and fun-loving luster the place
emits.
</P>
<P>
   It's a well-earned reputation and as much a sense of pride as a
way of life. Fun and sun. Steve Superior. Blondes. Cocktail
parties. Tans.
</P>
<P>
   The place radiates with an uninhibited spirit that covers the
Gators empire like a morning mist on a Central Florida swamp.
That's why Billy Donovan seems to personify this burgeoning love
affair between Gators fans and their newfound basketball glory.
</P>
<P>
   But even with his starched shirts and slicked-back hair, with
his pressing and running, his bold ways and free-spirited game,
Donovan is only half of the image that should be remembered in this
momentous Gators basketball turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Donovan is the master recruiter and daring young
coach, the image that fulfilled his dream is not typical Florida
brass and dash.
</P>
<P>
   It is a toothy, fair-skinned kid from the land of snowbanks and
prong-horned antelope. It is a lanky kid nicknamed ``Skinny'' who
put the Gators on the fast track to perhaps their first basketball
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tall, goofy white boy from South Dakota,'' is how Gators
forward Mike Miller describes himself.
</P>
<P>
   But such talent. Now a sophomore so skilled that if he decides
to forgo his last two seasons of eligibility he should be an NBA
lottery pick, Miller is likely the most talented player ever to put
on a Gators uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan naturally deserves much credit for persuading Miller two
years ago to travel 2,000 miles across the country and spurn the
likes of proven basketball powers Kansas and Kentucky. Donovan
admits that wooing everyone's All-American out of Mitchell, S.D.,
and making him the cornerstone piece to the Florida plan probably
was his greatest recruiting victory.
</P>
<P>
   And Miller still laughs about the telephone call he received
from Donovan at 12:01 a.m. on the first day coaches could contact
recruits in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was half-mad because Florida wasn't even on my list,''
Miller said. ``Here it is midnight, and I'm getting this call from
coach Donovan. But after that first conversation everything
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Months of intense, high-spirited recruiting ensued, with Donovan
constantly urging and prodding. But it was Miller alone who made
the boldest step and changed Florida's basketball fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody will ever truly understand the kind of pressure this
kid was under,'' Donovan said. ``We were second tier in a lot of
people's minds. But he wanted to put his own footprints on a
program.''
</P>
<P>
   By choosing the Gators, who were coming off seasons of 12-16,
13-17 and 14-15, Miller stomped all over conventional wisdom and
found himself in the middle of a bitter feud between Kansas coach
Roy Williams and Donovan. Williams _ amazed that a player of
Miller's ability would dare sign with a mediocre program without
something fishy going on _ reported Donovan to the NCAA, charging
Donovan with recruiting violations.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA investigated but found no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell into what coach Donovan was preaching, but some people
thought it was more complicated than that,'' Miller said. ``I could
have gone to Kansas and won. I could have gone to Kentucky and won.
But there's a lot more gratitude and satisfaction coming to Florida
and knowing that you helped start something.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this program keeps developing the way it has, maybe
somewhere down the line someone's going to ask a high school kid,
`Gee, why'd you pick Kansas over Florida?'''
</P>
<P>
   Since making his controversial decision to join Donovan two
years ago, the Gators have risen quickly, reaching well outside of
their usual in-state recruiting territory. High school players
across the country noticed Miller's bold steps and followed in
them.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Matt Bonner, from Concord, N.J., signed a year ago, as
did high school All-America forward Donnell Harvey of Shellman,
Ga., and superb high school All-America guard Brett Nelson, who has
been called the best player to hail from West Virginia since Jerry
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're successful here because we have players that buy into
coach Donovan's system and realize he gives us a freedom to just
play,'' Miller said. ``There are players here that could have gone
somewhere else and played 35, 40 minutes, but would they win and be
a part of something special?''
</P>
<P>
   If this amazing Florida rise should culminate with a victory
over Michigan State and a national championship tonight, their
fun-loving and free-wheeling style surely will fit the typical
Florida mold. But the key to it all was the decision the tall,
goofy white kid from South Dakota made two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was very, very rare,'' Donovan said. ``Most kids
would buckle and end up making the easy choice. But he did
something very tough. It seemed like he had to justify his choice
to everyone, but now he doesn't have to justify anything.''

COLUMBIA IN WEB VENTURE TO SHARE LEARNING FOR PROFIT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Britain, D.C.)   (jw) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Columbia University and several other of the world's
most prestigious academic centers are planning to capitalize on
their wealth of scholarly talent and stores of knowledge by
offering them on the Internet, for a price.
</P>
<P>
   The university is to announce Monday the formation of a
for-profit online partnership with the New York Public Library, the
British Library, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of
Natural History, the London School of Economics and Political
Science and Cambridge University Press.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the company, Fathom.com, will be to provide
knowledge in its broadest form _ classes taught by prominent
academics like the historian Simon Schama, reference books like the
Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, interviews from Columbia's oral
history archive with people like Dorothy Parker and Frank Lloyd
Wright, and documents like the Magna Carta.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia has been one of the most aggressive universities in
mining the commercial potential of its intellectual property
through patents and royalties, which bring it more than $100
million a year. Its new plan will try to harvest a similar type of
bounty through new-media technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Many offerings will be available free, while others will be
sold. The company also expects to have advertisers and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when big-name professors are beginning to strike deals
with independent Internet companies, George E. Rupp, Columbia's
president, describes the creation of Fathom.com as both an
offensive and defensive move, one that creates an avenue for its
professors to reach audiences beyond their Morningside Heights
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that our core intellectual capital is not
picked off by outside for-profit vendors,'' Rupp said. ``But for
that, we have to be able to say to our faculty that we will devise
ways they can communicate with a wider audience, which many of them
would like.'' But the university will not bar professors from
working with other companies once Fathom is operating, Rupp said.
Professors will not be required to contribute to Fathom, but they
will be paid if they do.
</P>
<P>
   A professor, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity,
called Fathom ``a great experiment.'' But, he said, while
``Columbia has thought more about intellectual property than most
other universities, there are still huge holes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It worries me a lot that universities think about the Internet
as a way to increase productivity of teaching,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia has given Fathom a five-year license and will hold part
ownership of the new venture. The university will also continue
separately to develop its ability to offer classes over the
Internet to its own students.
</P>
<P>
   Many other universities and companies have crowded into the
arena of Internet education. But Internet experts say the new
Columbia venture differs from other online education projects in
that it offers a range of materials, rather than just individual
courses or degree programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of bringing together universities, libraries and
museums _ the cultural repositories of the world _ and making them
available through the Internet is important,'' said Gene DeRose,
chairman of Jupiter Communications, an Internet research company
based in New York. ``I have not seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the partners have their own Internet sites, several
said they were drawn to Fathom because it offered access to a wider
audience and help in putting more of what they have online. Robert
Sullivan, associate director of public programs at the
Smithsonian's Natural History Museum, said Fathom was giving the
museum ``tremendous production capacity,'' enabling it to put
material online more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sullivan and Michael Zavelle, a senior vice president at
the New York Public Library, said there would be no charge for most
of what they posted through Fathom or on their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to add partners and to market courses
from colleges and universities that are not partners. Michael Crow,
executive vice provost at Columbia, said he hoped that about 10,000
courses from many universities might eventually be available
through Fathom.  &QL;

INDIANAPOLIS _ This is why he came back. For nights like this when
the air is electric with anticipation and heavy with the burden of
expectation.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in St. Petersburg, Fla., when his Spartans lost in a
semifinal game to Duke, he gathered them inside a room at the team
hotel and told them it wasn't enough and that the only acceptable
response was to return to the Final Four and become the Final One.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago at the conclusion of the Big Ten tournament, he
stepped up to the TV cameras and said his Spartans were going to
win it all. Now it is down to only two.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Mateen Cleaves came back for his senior year at
Michigan State. To play Florida for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   And also this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all like to get together and just hang out at each other's
apartment or house, playing video games, watching TV, just making
each other laugh,'' Cleaves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just show up at one guy's house and spread out all over the
place. We might order out for something to eat; we might watch
games on TV or a movie. And when we leave, we're just up and gone.
If it's your house, well, you get to clean up the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves is a point guard built like a fireplug, the words
spouting from him faster than water from the hydrant, and what is
pouring out now is how he sees that the past year could have been
different if he would have taken his game to the pay window of the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some guys in the NBA,'' Cleaves said. ``And I've heard
what it's like. You've got a locker room where there are 19- and
20-year-olds playing their video games alongside of guys who are 29
or older and have to leave practice right away to tend to the wives
and families. It's a strange mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here, we all get to be, well, kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids hanging out. Kids cracking jokes. Kids who are still out
there on the court trying to make the shots and the steals and the
plays for the same reasons they always have. Just to prove they're
better than the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   Probably if Cleaves hadn't suffered more injuries than a
crash-test dummy in his career at Michigan State _ back, shoulder,
stress fracture in a foot _ that slowed his development, he'd have
moved on along by now. And then he'd have missed all these things
that are now becoming precious memories. Seeing this team that
settled for the bittersweet taste of playing in the NIT his
freshman year climb the ladder to this spot, just one rung away
from the national championship. Sharing it all with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves is by no means a sure-shot future All-Star in the NBA.
Listed generously at 6-2, he doesn't run or jump or shoot the ball
particularly well. What he does is push the ball up the court, find
the holes, make the right passes, the right decisions, and lead. He
shot 1-for-7 with one assist in Saturday's victory over Wisconsin
and was invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   He will never draw comparisons with Steve Francis in terms of
athleticism. But if an Avery Johnson can be the starting point
guard on an NBA champion, then there likely is a place for Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Morris Peterson recognized that when they were both 8
years old, playing in a pee-wee tournament in their hometown of
Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this short, stocky guy and said, `Who's he?''' Peterson
recalled. ``But I could tell he had confidence and a game.''
</P>
<P>
   When Peterson's team won that first day and the stocky kid
flopped himself down on his belly and began to pound his fists onto
the court, he also could see how much winning meant to Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   So together with Antonio Smith and Charlie Bell, the four
``Flintstones'' took their act to Michigan State and put down the
bedrock upon which the Spartans' title hopes have been constructed
and relationships built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Morris, we know each other inside and out,'' Cleaves
said. ``All it takes is a look to know what the other is
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cleaves spent the first months of this season hobbling on
crutches with his stress fracture, Peterson said he cooked his
roomie's meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told you that?'' asked Cleaves. ``When Morris `cooked,'
that usually meant he drove out for some fast food or put popcorn
in the microwave.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week when his friend returned from attending his
grandmother's funeral in Mississippi, it was Cleaves who embraced
him and did all he could to pick him up, and Peterson produced 20
points to beat Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win this game, we go down in the books and we'll always
be remembered,'' Cleaves said. ``If we don't, I've had one more
year to hang out with Morris and the guys. To be a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why he came back. For tonight. For all those nights.

GOP CONGRESSMAN WEIGHS RESUMING N.Y. SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ariz.)  (jw) 
 By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, noting a recent decline in
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's standing in the polls, said on national
television Sunday that he was once again considering a bid for the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to run,'' Lazio, a Long Island Republican, said on
``This Week,'' ABC's Sunday morning political interview program.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, 42, a four-term congressman and a former Suffolk County
legislator, defied party leaders in announcing a bid for the Senate
last summer, but then backed down at the urging of Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said Sunday that the mayor's ``dramatically collapsing''
poll numbers against Hillary Rodham Clinton had led him to
reconsider his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of potentially blowing this race,''
Lazio said of the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's decline in the polls has been attributed to his
hard-line reaction to the March 16 fatal shooting of an unarmed man
by police officers. The mayor authorized the release of sealed
court records concerning the victim, Patrick Dorismond, and implied
that Dorismond had been partly responsible for his death.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he would run only if encouraged to do so by party
leaders. Spokesmen for Pataki and the New York Republican State
Committee made it clear Sunday afternoon that Lazio's entrance into
the race would not be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership has not changed its mind,'' said Dan
Allen, a Republican State Committee spokesman. ``We are 100 percent
behind Mayor Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenia Mucha, a senior policy adviser to Pataki, added: ``The
governor very strongly supports the mayor's candidacy for the
Senate and feels he is the best man to beat Hillary Rodham Clinton.
It is important that the Republican Party unite behind one
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager, said that Lazio's
comments were no surprise. ``It seems to me that he said all this
before,'' he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Long, chairman of the state Conservative Party, said
he hoped that Lazio would formally enter the Senate race, and that
he might win the endorsement of both the Conservative and
Republican parties.
</P>
<P>
   More so than Giuliani, Lazio ``reflects the views of the average
Republican throughout the state of New York,'' said Long, who has
clashed with the mayor over his support of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spent the weekend in Arizona, where he attended two
fund-raising events. He plans to campaign on Tuesday in New York
with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had backed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas over McCain in
the New York Republican presidential primary last month. But the
mayor also frequently complimented McCain, an old friend, and the
senator's staff members said he wanted to repay the favor by
encouraging moderate Republicans who had supported his bid for
president to back the mayor.

BRUINS IN OWN FINAL FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So, there it is.
</P>
<P>
   With only four games remaining in the Bruins' season, the
1999-2000 edition all boils down to contests against Tampa Bay
Tuesday, the Florida Panthers Wednesday, the Philadelphia Flyers
Saturday, and the Pittsburgh Penguins (the only game at the
FleetCenter) Sunday. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no postseason for Boston _ that became official
after Saturday's 2-2 tie with the New York Rangers, which knocked
both clubs out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing deadlock was a microcosm of the season _ the
Bruins played well for a time, got a lead, and then blew it in the
third period. The tying goal _ by Rangers rookie Michael York with
1:20 remaining in regulation _ was an awful case of Murphy's Law
for Boston right wing Eric Nickulas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned the puck over down below, then I try to get back and
I don't get back; I try to get it out on the point and can't get it
out,'' said Nickulas, shaking his head. ``I just watched it on the
film. York fed it out to the slot, another guy tried to one-time
it, and I went out and tried to block it. It hit my stick and it
was sitting right on the doorstep for him and he just put it in the
back door. What are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the way of a team chock-full of youngsters with little
experience. They have yet to learn to play with a lead, among many
other lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all it is _ frustration,'' said goalie John Grahame,
who weathered 14 shots in the third period and stopped all but
York's. ``We're playing solid for 50 minutes or 55 or whatever, not
just quite 60. We're just going to have to learn from it and keep
moving on. There's nothing you can do. Experience is the only way
we're going to learn. Hopefully, if we keep learning from it,
things will be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Grahame said he could see the difference in that fateful third
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York was jumping a lot more,'' he said. ``You can just see
the talent level they have. They can control it when they want to
and they just kind of took it to us in that third period. We held
them off as long as we could. We have to go back at them just as
hard instead of being intimidated by all the skill and everything
they have. If we would've come hard at them, I think the outcome
might have been a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent call-ups from Providence provided the Boston offense,
with Jay Henderson picking up his first NHL goal (as well as an
assist) and Antti Laaksonen, just recalled Saturday morning for his
fourth stint in Boston, getting the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice to see guys do well,'' said Grahame.
``They're getting an opportunity to show what they can do. For the
most part, everyone has tried to take advantage of it. I'm glad to
see it for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins started the season 0-5-4 but weren't playing as badly
as their record indicated. Lately, though, the team laden with AHL
players has been fine in spurts but has surrendered lead after
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is, either, to be honest,'' said Grahame.
``I'm just going out there and trying to stop the puck. Sometimes,
we have the lead and we don't stick with what got us there. We kind
of hang back a little bit. We didn't do it as much (against the
Rangers) but that's the way it goes sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to work on our positioning and try to overcome that
bad luck or whatever. I think maybe if we try to be more
aggressive, the outcome might have been a little different. We have
a lot of guys here with not a lot of experience. Everyone is
learning. Let's hope they're quick learners.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Nick Boynton made his NHL debut, logging 20 minutes
25 seconds over 17 shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really, really nervous, but after the first couple of
shifts, I felt pretty good so I can't complain,'' said Boynton, the
Bruins' first pick (No. 21 overall) in last June's draft. If he has
an area that isn't up to par, it's his conditioning. Boynton is
coming off a knee injury and had only played a couple of games in
Providence before being called up to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all right. I'm not quite what I should be,'' he said,
``but it's almost there. My knees feel fine. I strained my MCL and
came back a bit too soon and I tried to push it and just twisted it
again. It set me back a couple of weeks but I feel 100 percent
now.''

SAMPRAS TAKES TOUGH VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Maybe it isn't an epitaph Pete Sampras
would approve for himself, but words uttered a few years ago by a
rival, Jim Courier, seem to fit: ``Every time Pete looks dead . . .
he rises up to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gustavo ``Guga'' Kuerten understands.
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten, a Brazilian built like a scarecrow, threw a scare into
the high-flying Sampras, clipped his wings, and sent him into a
seemingly groggy tailspin as the Ericsson Open title bout
approached a roaring climax in its fourth set. The man from coffee
country drove the 14,000 witnesses filling Crandon Park Sunday to
such a frenzy that they'd better order decaf for a while.
</P>
<P>
   As Sampras resurrected himself on the green slab below them, the
patrons enhanced the electrified atmosphere by waging a spirited
vocal battle. Kuerten's flag-shaking Brazilian compatriots in green
and yellow chanted and sang his name _ ``Gooo-gaaa! Gooo-gaaa!'' _
and the Pete-pushers countered with choruses of ``Let's go, Pete!
Let's go, Pete!''
</P>
<P>
   It had everything. A nerves-busting opus that wound up with
Sampras admittedly ``choking on match points'' (squandering six of
them in the third overtime) _ and yet soaring after all, as great
champions do, to win, 6-1, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (10-8).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dogfight,'' said Sampras of the 3-hour-18-minute
bow-wowser that the underpup very nearly sent into a fifth set.
``It was my toughest match in months, more demanding than the
five-set semifinal I lost at the Australian to Andre Agassi. I
don't know if I could have recovered if it went to five. Sure, I
choked some; nerves got me at the end. I was probably lucky on the
last match point (the seventh) that his passing shot just missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I sucked it up. You do what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   You do if you are Sampras, holder of 12 majors, winning his 62d
pro singles title, now abreast of Bjorn Borg and Guillermo Vilas in
the all-time chase, though still behind Jimmy Connors (109), Ivan
Lendl (94), and John McEnroe (77).
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Sampras said with a laugh, ``I get a day off before
starting work for Davis Cup (a weekend series against the Czech
Republic in Los Angeles). It would have been very hard to get up
again if I'd lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuerten said with a shrug, ``When I play well, then he play
good, too. I think we were both tired, but I have more chance in
the fifth. But . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But the fifth will have to wait for another day because Sampras,
though wobbling and groping, dragging between every point in the
climactic 18-point tie-breaker, kept coming at Kuerten. Despite his
pale appearance, Sampras kept charging and reflexing vital volleys,
letting Kuerten know only the finest shots would beat him.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth set-that-wasn't could have commenced earlier if
Kuerten had seized one of the two set points for which he had
reached with Sampras serving at 5-6, 30-40, and then ad-out.
Sampras served and volleyed too determinedly to let it happen.
</P>
<P>
   With a reprieve, Sampras flapped to 3-0 in the decisive
tie-breaker, then 6-2, four successive match points, of which
Sampras would serve two. ``I was having it my way,'' he said, ``but
I got tight. Sure, it happens. Everybody in sports chokes
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And just like this,'' Sampras snapped his fingers, ``those
match points disappeared.'' His error; Kuerten's pair of low,
half-volley-disrupting returns; and another error. Suddenly it was
6-6. The stadium rocked with the two combatants.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras socked a backhand winner to set up a fifth match point
at 7-6. But he double-faulted, his second serve seeking the net
like a stupefied salmon. Back to form: a service winner to 8-7.
Oops, a backhand error, 8-8. Now Kuerten, with serve, was within
reach of another set point.
</P>
<P>
   But it was chip-and-charge time again, the serve-returning
tactic that much earlier had given Sampras a two-set lead.
</P>
<P>
   His return was a rare chip, a forehand, not very sharp, but it
got him to the service line for a nifty backhand volley. So the 9-8
lead belonged to him, not Kuerten, with a seventh match point.
</P>
<P>
   One last salute to Admiral Farragut: Damn Kuerten's torpedoes,
full steam ahead! One more serve, one more volley _ not forceful _
but Kuerten's forehand passer grazed the net cord on the way past
Sampras, enough of a disturbance to make it land an inch beyond the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing as well as I could for almost two sets,'' said
Sampras, who had launched killer hook serves for aces and winners,
volleyed acrobatically, and pressured Kuerten with the
chip-and-charge. ``But I let it slip, and Guga fought his way back
in. Not an accident, really. You think of him as a clay-court guy
(he's the French Open champ of 1997), but Guga can play on this or
anything. He'll be around, and good, for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The nimble, whippy scarecrow _ 6 feet 3 inches, 150 pounds _
almost frightened Sampras to death. But with Sampras, it's always
too soon for an epitaph.

 WAYNE McALLISTER, 92, ARCHITECT FOR A CAR CULTURE  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wayne McAllister, a West Coast architect who some critics say
elevated commercial structures like the drive-in restaurant and the
theme resort to art forms, died on March 22 in Arcadia, Calif. He
was 92.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister injured his head in a fall on March 3 near his home
in Pasadena, Calif., and never regained consciousness, said his son
Donald.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister created his designs for a world shaped by the
automobile and for people who seldom willingly left it, even to
eat. He let them drive through fantasy drive-ins and cruise by
palaces on the Las Vegas strip.
</P>
<P>
   Among McAllister's memorable creations were the Sands (the
hangout for Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin), El Rancho Hotel (the
first of many theme resorts on the Las Vegas Strip), the expansion
of the Los Feliz Brown Derby and restaurants for the Pig 'n Whistle
and Kentucky Fried Chicken chains.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rapid growth of cities like Los Angeles and Las
Vegas, where his works once dotted the cityscapes, and because
flamboyant commercial architecture was not highly regarded, only a
few of his buildings survive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, however, Chris Nichols, an architectural historian, led
a successful effort to have the Bob's Big Boy restaurant,
McAllister's low-slung, mustard-colored, drive-in on Riverside
Drive in Los Angeles, designated as a California State Point of
Historical Interest. The 1949 restaurant, the third Bob's built and
the oldest still in existence, is considered an outstanding example
of 1940s art moderne, with a whiff of 1950s coffee-shop modern.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in McAllister's work grew, and in 1998 an exhibition of
photographs and drawings of his designs was presented at the
Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles. ``Wayne McAllister didn't
invent the drive-in restaurant, but in the 1930s he took it a step
higher than the diner and made it reflect a way of life,'' said
Nichols, curator of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture critic Alan Hess has praised McAllister's work
in his books ``Googie: Fifties Coffee Shop Architecture'' (1986)
and ``Viva Las Vegas'' (1993). Calling McAllister ``one of the most
significant architects of the 20th century in terms of creativity
of form and influence,'' Hess said, ``He saw that the world was
becoming shaped by the automobile.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part McAllister was humble. In 1998 he told The Los
Angeles Times, ``I just ran a modest office and did modest work.''
</P>
<P>
   He often said that he simply tried to fill a need, and that his
futuristic dazzle was ``influenced by the automobile, not the
architect.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on Nov. 17, 1907, in San Diego, McAllister dropped out of
high school to work for an architect. At 20 he designed the Mexican
resort Agua Caliente, which was later frequented by Clark Gable,
Jean Harlow and Gloria Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Donald, who lives in Corvallis, Ore.,
McAllister is survived by his wife, Corinne, of Pasadena; two other
children, David of Tucson, Ariz., and Paulette of Prescott, Ariz.;
four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   McAllister gave up architecture in 1956 and moved to Washington
to become vice president of Marriott Corp. He returned to Los
Angeles in 1962 where he developed coin-operated copying machines.

CELTICS WORK ON TURNAROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After Boston lost to Cleveland Saturday night, Antoine
Walker was the last player to the leave the locker room. He took
his time getting dressed. Then, he took his time talking about the
Celtics' latest setback. He did not rush to the team bus, but
answered every last question. He did not run from the bad luck and
bad play that has doomed Boston, but faced a future that does not
include the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' seventh straight defeat left Walker disappointed
but not despondent. Seven games behind Orlando in the Eastern
Conference, Boston's focus has shifted. The Celtics have nine games
left to show signs of progress and demonstrate they are better than
their 30-43 record. According to Walker, there's no better time
than the present to start reversing the Celtics' fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to keep playing,'' he said. ``We've got to get off
this losing streak first. We've got nine games that we're going to
try to win. We've got to come in with the mentality that we're
going to win the next nine and go from there. You can have no other
mindset or you'll never reach your potential, you'll never get 110
percent effort every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to keep working and make the next nine games
the most positive nine games we can make it. We've just got to
continue to work and not get discouraged. We're fighting through a
lot of adversity and we've got to continue to battle and fight and
it's going to show the character of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout March and into April, the Celtics' learning curve has
followed a tortuous path. They were tantalizingly close to a
postseason appearance before the season unraveled in dramatic
fashion. If Boston's emotions were actually charted, the line would
be marked with sharp peaks and valleys that kept getting lower.
</P>
<P>
   The ups and downs have been well-documented: three losses at the
buzzer in March; a Rick Pitino rant about the negativity in Boston;
an impressive 7-2 stretch that followed the tirade; the
double-overtime defeat in Philadelphia that effectively sucked the
playoff life out of Boston; an embarrassing loss at Orlando that
led to finger-pointing and the threat of suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   All that and Boston continues to find experiences to learn from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past frustration. You know what I mean. It's frustration
10 times over,'' said Eric Williams after the Celtics let a
10-point lead slip away against the Cavaliers. ``We've just got to
go out there and play these games and learn how to win games down
the stretch. It's not about the other team. It's us right now.
We're still trying to figure it all out. We can break down the tape
and go through everything. If we don't do it on the court, it's all
for naught.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the tough losses and the times they caught glimpses
of their unrealized potential, the Celtics are not planning to
stagger to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got is games to play so we can get better, have
pride in ourselves,'' said Kenny Anderson. ``We can come to work
every day until the last buzzer goes off. It's still our job. We're
not making the playoffs, but we've got to play and get better and
carry it into next season. We can't throw in the towel because of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Walker: ``We've got to keep plugging and try to somehow
salvage our season by playing good basketball and proving to
ourselves that we can play and continue to know that it's going to
turn around for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker hopes the next couple of days will give the Celtics a
chance to rest and ready themselves for the final two weeks of the
season. But Boston next faces back-to-back road games with
playoff-bound teams in Charlotte and Detroit. Not exactly the
situation a team trying to snap a losing streak wants to find
itself in. Still, Walker voices optimism. He sees the road games as
an opportunity for a late-season turnaround.

   ``It's not so much what the team can take,'' said Walker of the
mounting losses. ``We've got to correct. Nobody from the outside
can help you. The only way to correct it is the one game that gets
us back on the positive side. We've got to do it on the road.
You've got to come in with the right frame of mind. I think we
will. One day, we're going to have our time in the sun and be the
team on top.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the young and wealthy should learn, it's never too soon
to start preparing for the future.

BAD LUCK KEEPS CURTAILING PARK'S SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It's turning out to be a disturbing pattern
for Steve Park.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six races, including yesterday's DirecTV 500 at
Texas Motor Speedway, Park has either had a top-10 finish or a
blown engine.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worse part of that cycle yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Park had climbed to fourth with fewer than 70 laps remaining,
when his car began to smoke. He had to pit on Lap 314, when Winston
Cup officials posted a black flag. Park said that he lost a
cylinder in his No. 1 Pennzoil Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Park finished 19th, one week after he won the pole at Bristol
and ended up seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a motor, that is all you can say,'' Park said. ``We
had another good top-five run going, and to have it spoiled with
another motor problem ... I am so disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Park admitted that he might not have had a car that could keep
up with his Dale Earnhardt Inc. teammate and race-winner Dale
Earnhardt Jr. But he was expecting a top-five finish.
</P>
<P>
   The way things have been going for Park this season, though,
yesterday was an unfortunate day in a cycle that started in
Rockingham, N.C., in February. He finished ninth in that race on
Feb. 27, but one week later he lost a motor at Las Vegas and was
43rd.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to form at Atlanta on March 12, picking up a
career-best, fourth-place finish. Then on March 19, he had another
motor problem and ended up 39th in Darlington, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistent finishes have kept Park from climbing the point
standings. He was 19th after yesterday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win races and finish races if your stuff don't stay
together,'' Park said. ``That is not the kind of streak you want to
be a part of. Junior was real fast all day long. The 18 \RBobby
Labonte\S and 99 \RJeff Burton\S seemed to be the class of the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's engine troubles are strange considering that Dale
Earnhardt Jr.'s engines come out of the same shop. Park has had
more top-10 finishes over the first seven races of the season, but
Earnhardt's engines have stayed together through most every race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our confidence is high,'' Park said. ``This wavers you and
takes the wind out of you a little bit. It could be worse. We could
be running like junk and blowing up. It seems like when you run
like that your stuff lasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Park still managed to smile because Earnhardt Jr. won
yesterday's race, but Park must now focus on next week's race at
Martinsville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   He will take a new car, that the team will test tomorrow in
Greenville, S.C., to Martinsville He just hopes that he will
finally break the cycle and match the accomplishment of his
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be a part of a two-car team because we both have
the availability to test and we share a lot of information,'' Park
said. ``We can get a win if we can stop breaking down. We got a
good race team there, and I am keeping a good perspective about
it.''

RUSTY WALLACE SAYS FOURTH PLACE KEEPS HIS MOMENTUM GOING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   I had a great car today. I led a lot of laps. I wound up in the
top five.
</P>
<P>
   I had good pit stops, but not great pit stops. I was losing
three and four positions, and one time I lost eight. And I said,
``Man, I just can't take those chances any more.'' So I started
putting on two tires so we could get track position. And the two
tires ran really, really good for me.
</P>
<P>
   We gained a lot of points (moving up to fifth in the Winston Cup
standings). It was a good strong run. I finished fourth here last
year, so it looks like I'm stuck on fourth. But I'm not going to
complain about it because that was a good run. And to come off a
win and come here and finish fourth and keep the momentum going and
gain a lot of points ... that's what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   I thought the track was excellent. All day long it was
consistent. I thought the tires were consistent.
</P>
<P>
   We had a seventh new winner this year today. The races have been
so damn exciting it's been unreal after the Daytona fiasco with the
cars not being real racey. Of course, it sure has changed a lot. It
was great all day long.
</P>
<P>
   Man, the race was just action-packed. It was super-exciting.
</P>
<P>
   And the fans got to see a new kid win, a young guy win who's
pretty much a fan favorite. I'm happy for him. We're competing on
the track for the beer brands, but we don't really compete. He's a
good kid.
</P>
<P>
   It establishes him as one of the forces. He did a great job.
They got that car dialed in and really flying. The thing that was
so good about it is that when they put new tires on, it would run
fast. When I put new tires on my car, it would dog my car down. A
lot of guys, I noticed, it would dog their cars down. But he would
put new tires on and make his fly.
</P>
<P>
   A little overanxious driving caused the wrecks. It sure wasn't
the racetrack. On some of those restarts, a lot of guys had rubber
built up on their tires. I could see that. And they'd get up on
that outside and get a little loose, and that was hurting.
</P>
<P>
   I just drove around the wrecks. I never was around any crashes.
I got lucky. I wasn't in that atmosphere.

DALE JARRETT'S GOOD DEED CAN'T SAVE A BAD DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ No good deed goes unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, NASCAR's defending Winston Cup Series champion,
experienced the harsh reality of that adage yesterday during the
DirecTV 500 at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's No. 88 Quality Care Ford slammed into the wall in Turn
1 on Lap 247 after touching the No. 28 Texaco//Havoline Ford driven
by teammate Ricky Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett led the race on three occasions for a total of 18 laps,
but the accident doomed him to a 33rd-place finish after qualifying
fifth Friday. Jarrett returned to race after being examined and
released from Lone Star Health Infield Care Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be OK,'' said Jarrett, whose car also received attention
in the garage during his examination. ``I'm just a little bit sore.
I hit my right knee on the steering column.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett also appeared sore, perhaps at Rudd. Jarrett could not
identify the cause for his accident, although replays revealed that
their cars touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the replay,'' Jarrett said. ``I didn't. I don't know.
I'm not sure what happened. I just know I got into one. The car
started wiggling. If that was from a touch or if that was from the
tires, I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd's participation in the accident proved ironic. Jarrett
slowed before the start//finish line and allowed Rudd to pass him
and remain on the lead lap preceding the race's caution for laps
157-159.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Parrott, Jarrett's crew chief, went out of his way to shed
light on his team's good deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 28 car got his one help for the day,'' Parrott told CBS'
national television audience. ``Now, they've got to get the car
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words came back to haunt Parrott.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the second consecutive disappointing weekend for
Jarrett, who finished 21st in the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor
Speedway on March 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are just things that you go through,'' Jarrett said.
``We'll have to come back next time.''

NEW-LOOK TEAM, SAME OLD PROBLEMS IN TEXAS FOR GORDON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF WILSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway remains a mystery to
Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beats the heck out of me,'' said Gordon, unable to pinpoint
his bad luck here. ``I just can't seem to stay out of trouble. I
don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-car wreck in Turn 2 yesterday became the latest malady
for the three-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion at TMS. Gordon was
running in the top 20 of the DirecTV 500 and nose-to-tail with a
pack of cars that encountered slower, lapped cars. Gordon struck
Hendrick Racing teammate Jerry Nadeau, who started the incident
when he tapped Dave Blaney. The worst damage, though, was caused by
Bill Elliott, whose car briefly lifted onto Gordon's hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't pass. I couldn't do anything,'' Gordon said.
``If you can't pass, you're going to have a lot of wrecks, and
that's what happened today.''
</P>
<P>
   The wreck was the fourth for Gordon in four Cup races at TMS. He
also crashed in the Coca-Cola 300 Busch Grand National race in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good out there until I got in the back of Jerry,''
Gordon said. ``Before that, everything was really good. We were
just biding our time, waiting for track position.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon managed to stay on the lead lap but eventually lost it
and went behind the wall for repairs on Lap 265. He returned five
laps later and finished the race down 14 laps and in 25th place.
Nadeau finished 43rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do?'' Nadeau said. ``It's just part of
NASCAR racing. The cars bunched up in front of me and I got back
into the No. 93 after someone tapped me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's previous best at TMS was a 30th-place run in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a place that really is easy to maneuver,'' Gordon
said. ``This is the toughest place there is on the circuit to pass.
It's a one-groove racetrack. It doesn't offer what we are notorious
for.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Gordon has been notorious for his fall from Cup
contender to a driver struggling to adapt to a new team.
</P>
<P>
   A patchwork crew of ``Rainbow Warriors'' helps a new crew chief
service the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet. Late last
season, Ray Evernham left Gordon to help jump-start
Daimler-Chrysler's venture into Cup racing with Dodge in 2001.
Robbie Loomis was hired after last season to replace Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the off-season, reigning Cup champion Dale Jarrett
hired five Warriors to the No. 88 Quality Care Ford team, leaving
Gordon without six team members who helped him to three series
titles in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The new No. 24 team has yet jell to Gordon's standards. He has
gone 12 races without a top-five finish. Gordon stands 12th in
points after yesterday's race. nn

YANKEES' RIVERA EXPECTS LONG-TERM CONTRACT SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (REMOVES reference to luxury tax in lede.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mariano Rivera, the New York Yankees' closer,
said Sunday that he was hopeful of reaching agreement on a
long-term contract shortly into the season. ``I think we could get
something done,'' he said. ``I'm not looking to get all the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are not negotiating with Rivera, who is the game's
best closer, but there was not a large divide in the proposals
passed between the two sides before the Feb. 17 arbitration
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hearing, the Yankees had offered Rivera a four-year,
$36 million contract, according to people familiar with the
negotiations. Just as the case was about to be heard, Rivera's
agent offered four proposals with suggested packages of $37.5
million, $38 million, $38.5 million and $39 million. Under the
$37.5 million proposal, the reliever's base salary would have
increased by $750,000 if he had won the Rolaids award as the top
reliever, and there were similar bonuses attached to the other
packages as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera lost his case and will earn $7.25 million this year,
rather than the $9.25 million for which he asked. Rivera and
shortstop Derek Jeter will be eligible for free agency after the
2001 season. Jeter, whose agent negotiated a seven-year, $118.5
million deal that never got final approval from the principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, said he knew of no progress toward
completing any contract. ``It's not up to me,'' Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Johnson, the former Mets outfielder, was added to the
Yankees' major league roster Sunday as the team made its final
moves in preparation for Monday's season opener against the Angels.
Johnson, 36, agreed to a one-year deal worth $350,000, and he will
be used primarily as a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance is very excited about the chance to be with the
Yankees,'' said Phil Tannenbaum, his agent. Johnson was expected to
arrive here this evening and perhaps participate in a workout at
the Angels' Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will open the season using Jim Leyritz as their
backup catcher, behind Jorge Posada; six outfielders, including
Johnson and Roberto Kelly as bench players; six infielders,
including Clay Bellinger and the newly acquired Wilson Delgado; and
11 pitchers _ the opening day starter, Orlando Hernandez, and Roger
Clemens, David Cone, Andy Pettitte, Ramiro Mendoza, Mariano Rivera,
Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson, Allen Watson, Jason Grimsley and Todd
Erdos.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees designated pitcher Mike Buddie for assignment and
have 10 days to trade him or pass him through waivers. They also
optioned pitcher Darrell Einertson to Triple-A Columbus and
reassigned infielder Jon Zuber, outfielder Felix Jose, pitcher
Domingo Jean and catcher Chris Turner to Triple-A. &QL;

SCHOUREK SIGNING THROWS WAKEFIELD A CURVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a move that inevitably will raise almost as many
questions about the state of the Red Sox pitching staff as it will
answer, the Sox brought back lefthander Pete Schourek and put him
in the starting rotation, bumping Tim Wakefield back to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, best known for his valiant performance as manager Jimy
Williams's much-debated choice to pitch the deciding game of the
1998 American League Division Series against the Cleveland Indians,
was released last week by Pittsburgh just two days before training
camp ended in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates elected to eat Schourek's $2 million salary and go
with rookie Jimmy Anderson rather than have the 30-year-old as
their fifth starter.
</P>
<P>
   But Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, by offering Schourek a
club option for the 2001 season for essentially the same money he
is to be paid this season, outbid the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and
Atlanta Braves for Schourek's services. The Sox will be obliged to
pay only the minimum $200,000 this season for Schourek, with the
Pirates picking up the rest of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real tempting,'' Schourek said of the offer from the
Braves, the defending National League champions who instead signed
veteran John Burkett to help fill the void created by the
season-ending elbow surgery to John Smoltz. ``But they didn't want
to make much of a commitment to me. They just wanted to use me for
the time being until one of their younger pitchers was ready, just
filling the gap, and then I would have been back in the same
situation again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox signaled a greater commitment, he said, with their
offer of an added year on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is guaranteed in baseball,'' he said. ``But the Red
Sox made a little more of a financial commitment than Atlanta was
willing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An agreement was reached Friday, a day when Schourek worked out
with the high school team in West Springfield, Va., for which his
brother, Danny, is an assistant coach. But Duquette did not
announce the move until Sunday here, where the Sox open the 2000
season Tuesday night at 8 against the Seattle Mariners. Schourek
will pitch the in Anaheim on Friday, the opening game of a
three-game set against the Angels. That was the start Wakefield was
on track to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know _ destiny, I guess,'' Schourek said with a
chuckle as he reeled off the chain of events that brought him back
to the Red Sox, who first bought him from the Houston Astros in an
August 1998 waiver deal.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek made eight starts for the Sox down the stretch, going
1-3 with a 4.30 ERA. With Pedro Martinez in no shape to pitch on
short rest in the playoffs, according to pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan, Schourek was selected to start Game 4 of the '98 Division
Series, and responded with 5 1/3 scoreless innings in a game the
Sox ultimately lost, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek thought he'd found a home in Boston after that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of excited going into the offseason, thinking I'd
get a halfway-decent deal for the way I'd pitched,'' Schourek said.
``But as I recall, Boston offered me a minor league deal. I was
kind of surprised, but I got over it in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, worried about Schourek's history of elbow trouble, were
reluctant to commit beyond a minor league deal and went into last
season without a lefthander in the rotation. Schourek, meanwhile,
did not live up to Pittsburgh's expectations, going 4-7 with a 5.34
ERA in 30 appearances last season, and failed to finish the sixth
inning in 12 of his 17 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox took Sunday off but plan to work out at Safeco Field
this afternoon. Williams said Schourek will throw three innings in
a simulated game. Schourek acknowledged that Pirates doctors found
some small bone chips in his left elbow but said that after taking
anti-inflammatory medication he was OK.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield stepped in as closer last year when Tom Gordon tore
the ligament in his right elbow but he thought his days as a
reliever were over entering camp this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield pitched two innings in a minor league game in Fort
Myers Sunday, allowing one run. He arrived at the team's hotel at
about 9 p.m. local time. Asked for his reaction to being sent to
the pen, Wakefield said, ``I'll let you know tomorrow. I'm meeting
with Jimy and Joe (Kerrigan, pitching coach).
</P>
<P>
   All spring, Wakefield had been adamant about not pitching again
in relief. But the Sox, who left Wakefield off the roster for the
ALCS against the New York Yankees in October, once again dealt a
blow to his ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's disappointed,'' said Williams. ``I don't blame
him. But we don't have a lot of pitchers in the minor leagues to
put in Juan Pena's spot or Rod Beck's spot. I feel it's a good
move, putting a veteran pitcher in that slot who has pitched there
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have a number of marginal big leaguers who have pitched
in relief before _ Dan Smith, Julio Santana, Willie Adams _ who
could have been pressed into service for the short term until Beck
recovers from the irritated nerve in his neck. Schourek's signing
suggests the Sox want him for the rotation not only to take
Wakefield's spot but perhaps to replace lefthander Jeff Fassero,
who was 5-14 last season and did not have a good spring.
</P>
<P>
   Williams insisted the move was born of necessity, not as a
commentary on Wakefield's performance this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told Wakefield before spring training he was going to
start, but things happened to our pitchers,'' Williams said. ``He's
pitched out of the bullpen before. We need him. Does this mean he
won't start again? No.''

SPRING EXPECTATIONS COULD LEAD TO NASTY FALL 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The 100th American League Boston baseball season
begins Tuesday night in this town without Griffey. The Red Sox will
be more than 3,000 miles from home when Pedro Martinez toes the
rubber at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   To find a season in which more was expected of the Red Sox, one
probably would have to go back to the spring of 1978 when 20-game
winner Dennis Eckersley joined a team that a year earlier had seven
All-Stars, hit a franchise record 213 homers, and won 97 games.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it feels this spring. The 2000 Sox haven't played
a game yet, but they are kings of New England, expected to light up
the summer sky and compete with the hated Yankees come harvest
time.
</P>
<P>
   The boundless expectation has, at times, seemed silly. The Sox
have two of the game's top five players in Martinez and Nomar
Garciaparra. They're coming off seasons of 92 and 94 wins and
they've added five-tool center fielder Carl Everett. They're
capable of scoring a ton of runs without hitting a ton of homers,
and Derek Lowe could be a dominant closer. Best of all, they should
be held up by an AL that has only a couple of really good teams _
the Yankees and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But is it fair to put them on the cover of Sports Illustrated
with a headline predicting that this is the year they finally win
the World Series? Is there some form of mass delusion at work when
thousands of citizens of Red Sox Nation walk around saying, ``This
is the year''?
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are hot. No doubt about it. Never mind their sorry
spring record of 11-19. Never mind the fact that their No. 2 and 3
starters _ Ramon Martinez and Jeff Fassero _ kept getting lit up
this spring. Never mind that Ramon has pitched 20 2/3
regular-season big league innings since June of '98 and that
Fassero was 5-14 last year. Never mind that Juan Pena, a contender
for the No. 5 job a week ago, might never pitch in the big leagues
again now that he's slated for Tommy John surgery.
</P>
<P>
   All teams have holes and it's early to suggest that the wheels
could fall off this Sox machine. But unlike other years, they're
not going to sneak up on anyone in 2000. The Sox have targets on
their backs. Bettering predictions of low finishes is easier than
playing up to great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Sox general manager Dan Duquette admits, ``It's easier to
operate the ball club when expectations are low . . . but it's nice
to come into the season with a good foundation of fan support.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Sox players have no idea how much New England expects from
them. They dispersed after losing the playoffs to the Yankees and
they weren't around to see the Patriots, Bruins, and Celtics get
flushed down the hopper. They haven't endured Pete Carroll, Jeremy
Jacobs, Ray Bourque getting traded, and Rick Pitino's diatribes
about the ``negativity'' in the New Garden. They can't possibly
know of the winter wasteland that was New England sports in
1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell what it's like in Boston, because I haven't been
there yet,'' says Pedro. ``But I'm glad they expect good things.
What they expect we can do is one thing and what we can do is
another thing. I hope we can please them. I hope we can do whatever
we can do to win it all and give it to Boston. Boston deserves
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When this opening trip to Seattle and Anaheim is over, the Sox
will come home to a town hungry for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, who was a junior at Amherst when the fever last peaked
in '78, says, ``There's been a lot of enthusiasm for the Red Sox
over the wintertime. People really enjoyed themselves last year
during the Division Series and the ALCS. They're enthusiastic that
the core of the team is returning. We had enthusiasm from the fans
on the winter tour and it was also reflected in fans buying
tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that the fans are excited about this
team,'' says veteran John Valentin. ``Expectations are always gonna
be there and it's good they're high.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley, another veteran, admitted he hasn't been in Boston
since the day after Orlando Hernandez beat Kent Mercker in Game 5.
``I can only just imagine what it's like,'' he says. ``But the way
they reacted to what we did last year when they weren't optimistic
and we provided, now I think they are anxious to get us back. But I
don't think it will change our approach. We can use the extra buzz
at Fenway. When we've got a quality team on the field, it puts that
much more pressure on the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans like these players,'' adds Duquette. ``They like
Pedro, they like Nomar. They like (Jason) Varitek and Troy O'Leary
and they were enthusiastic about the addition of Carl Everett.
Ninety-nine was a great year for Boston baseball and they're all
coming back for this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox uniform through the years has proved too heavy for some.
Calvin Schiraldi couldn't play here. Neither could Matt Young, nor
Mike Marshall. Wade Boggs and Roger Clemens were among those who
had to go elsewhere to win championships. Fred Lynn and Bruce Hurst
played their best ball here, but didn't like the climate. Both
later regretted leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure's there,'' acknowledges young reliever Lowe.
``When you come to Boston you're expected to win and that's the way
it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to win in 2000. Historically, the Sox have not
been at their best under these conditions. But it's a new century.

TEACHERS SEEK `CLASSROOM BILL OF RIGHTS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE AND DAVID R. BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Angrily rejecting the school district's plan to
tie teacher pay to performance, Los Angeles' powerful teachers
union on Sunday unveiled its own contract proposal, demanding a
cumulative 21 percent raise.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal from United Teachers Los Angeles also goes far
beyond mere issues of pay, calling for a ``Classroom Bill of
Rights'' that would cap class sizes in all grades and make unclean
classrooms or a lack of textbooks grounds for a grievance against
the school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole lot of very angry people,'' said union
President Day Higuchi, addressing the union's membership at
Hamilton High School, just north of Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which represents the union's opening offer in
contract talks, makes no mention of the district's performance-pay
plan. Enraged teachers have threatened to strike if the district
doesn't drop the idea, which would give teachers extra pay if their
school's test scores improve.
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi said that as a practical matter because of legal
barriers to public teachers' striking, a strike is not imminent,
but he predicted that strike sentiments will continue to grow among
the rank and file if the district dismisses their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Higuchi said the 21 percent raise would equate to about $400
million. He said the amount demanded by the union could change as
the amount of available money for salaries is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   He justified the raise demands, saying the district is
hemorrhaging good teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a certificated teacher and it (the raise) makes you
not leave, that's good for the institution,'' Higuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Unified School District leaders called the union's
offer unrealistic. Desperately behind in its effort to build more
schools to handle swelling enrollment, the district has no room to
cap class sizes in every grade or end the sharing of classrooms,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Ramon Cortines said he agrees that smaller class
sizes are a worthy goal but wouldn't comment about the salary
increase demand until he sees the UTLA proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one pot of money,'' he said. ``You can have it in
salaries, in incentives, or for class size.''
</P>
<P>
   Cortines also said that the district has not spent the tens of
millions of dollars it has available for textbooks, making the
teachers' demands regarding them unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The union proposal aims to improve both the pay and working
conditions of the district's 43,000 teachers by taking steps the
plan's executive summary calls ``extensive and drastic.'' The union
wants:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 6 percent raise retroactive to July 1 and a 15 percent raise
for the 2000-2001 school year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clean, safe schools with adequate supplies of textbooks and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   _ A program through which teachers review the performance of
their peers and help those struggling in the job.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal leaves the union and the district far apart as they
head into contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   District officials have proposed a 6 percent raise, 1.8 percent
of which would go to health and benefits and 2 percent of which
would make permanent a one-time increase granted last year. In
addition, teachers at low-performing schools that steadily improve
their test scores could earn up to $5,000 extra.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to tie pay to student achievement has angered many
teachers, who feel they may be penalized for factors such as
poverty that affect students' grades but are outside teachers'
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't use that as an excuse for our children not
learning,'' said board member Caprice Young. ``I'd love to be able
to have higher pay raises. It's a matter of finding the money.''

FILM INDUSTRY ALARMED BY NET PROGRAMS THAT COPY MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The   San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Even if record companies manage to unplug the
popular and controversial online music search program Napster,
Derek-PLA won't care.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania high school student and countless other
programmers around the world have already come up with alternatives
to Napster that not only find free top music hits on the Net, but
also free full-length feature movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they can do about it,'' said the
16-year-old, known online as Derek-PLA, who wrote and posted a
program called VBGNUtella.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have to shut down the whole Internet if they wanted to
stop someone from downloading illegal songs,'' he said. ``Nobody
wants to pay for music when they can get it for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Internet denizens aren't waiting for lawyers from
Napster Inc. of San Mateo and the Recording Industry Association of
America to define copyright infringement laws in court.
</P>
<P>
   In just three weeks, dozens of programs like VBGNUtella have
appeared on the Internet, permutations of a file-swapping program
called Gnutella that was released as a demo by the Nullsoft
division of America Online for just one day in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   They have joined other Napsterlike programs and services like
Wrapster, iMesh and Spinfrenzy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a new, rising threat to the film and DVD
industry _ DivX, a program that can be used to copy and compress a
full-length feature film on a DVD into a file that can fit onto one
standard 650 MB CD-ROM. Some observers believe DivX may eventually
do to movies what the MP3 format has done to the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment establishment may be headed for a free-for-all
on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Napster goes away, what Napster has created doesn't go
away,'' said Malcolm Maclachlan, an analyst with International Data
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Napster founder Shawn Fanning invented more than just a computer
program that allows easy sharing of best-selling hit songs without
having to buy a CD. Napster has introduced an idea that will be
hard to stifle: the idea of using a decentralized network of
individual computers on the Internet to share and swap files.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of creative programmers out there on the Net
who can constantly develop and refine new Napster-type programs.
And they can easily remain ahead of the law and the entertainment
industry.
</P>
<P>
   With such a distributed network of people creating and using
those programs, trying to haul each one into court would be like
trying to capture the ocean with a bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is always going to be five or 10 steps behind where
the technology is,'' said Neil Rosini, a copyright law attorney
with Franklin, Weinrib, Rudell &AMP; Vassallo of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the Napster case, the Recording Industry Association of
America, which represents major record labels, filed a copyright
infringement suit against Napster in December, about four months
after the first demo version became available on the Napster Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the earliest the RIAA can obtain a court order halting
Napster will be June.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Napster has become a popular tool among college
students with high-speed Internet access who fill up their hard
drives with free music. Napster users make their personal library
of MP3 files on their computer's hard drive available for download
by other Napster members.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to capitalize on Napster's notoriety, San Francisco's
WiredPlanet, an online music site, last week launched a service
called MyStation, which in the company's words combines
``Napsterlike music-locating features with legal, streaming MP3
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the similar file-swapping Gnutella is also gaining
steam. Gnutella was developed by Nullsoft, the same company that
produced WinAmp, the most popular software program for playing MP3
files on a personal computer. Gnutella looks for swapable MP3
files, but also finds swapable movies.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers at Nullsoft, now owned by AOL, released a Gnutella
beta on March 15 for people to try, but suddenly yanked the program
off the Web and shut down the project.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers were still able to reverse-engineer what they had
already seen of Gnutella and come up with their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cat is more of less out of the bag,'' Maclachlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Napster, there is no company behind Gnutella, and there
are no centralized servers or Internet service providers that the
record industry could go after.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these distributed operations, who do you sue over
Gnutella?'' Maclachlan said.
</P>
<P>
   But information about Gnutella is abundant, with sites like
www.cdfreaks.com and gnutella.nerdherd.net providing instructions
and links.
</P>
<P>
   Derek-PLA wrote his version in the Visual Basic programming
language. He said he regularly chats and collaborates online with
other Gnutella programmers to help create better versions.
</P>
<P>
   Gnutella's popularity is rising, although it's hard to quantify
because there isn't a single source of information.
</P>
<P>
   Derek-PLA said a week after Nullsoft shut down the official
Gnutella project, he found about 300 computers online using a
Gnutella clone. One day last week, he went online and found more
than 1,600 computers logged in offering about one terabyte worth of
songs.
</P>
<P>
   And he also was able to find two downloadable, pirated copies of
the movie ``Mission to Mars,'' which is still playing in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   While movie files still take several hours to download, DivX
surfaced on the Internet in March with the ability to copy and
shrink DVD files down to a size that is easier to transmit and
store on a computer hard drive or writable CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   DivX, which has no connection to the defunct Divx DVD format
promoted by the Circuit City, Calif., retail chain, is the work of
authors who go by the names ``MaxMorice'' and ``Gej.'' The program
is posted at http://divx.ctw.cc.
</P>
<P>
   According to the information file on the program, the authors
``hacked'' Microsoft MPEG4 video technology, and used the MP3
format to reduce a film's audio soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The process of copying, or ``ripping,'' a movie from a DVD is
still complicated and highly technical, and there is so far no
consumer-friendly program like a WinAmp for DivX.
</P>
<P>
   But Maclachlan noted that playing MP3 files was just as
complicated in 1997, until easy-to-use players and copiers like
WinAmp started to appear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For people who are technically inclined, Web sites like
Global-DivX, at &UR;  &LR; http://divx.vcdguide.com, have sprung up to
provide step-by-step instructions along with other news and
information.
</P>
<P>
   The site lists movies such as ``The Nutty Professor,'' ``Last of
the Mohicans'' and ``Universal Soldier: The Return'' as the latest
releases available in DivX form.
</P>
<P>
   ``DivX won't do for DVD quite what MP3 did for music, but I
think it will leave a mark,'' said Global-DivX Webmaster Michael
Saunders of Australia in an e-mail. ``It has potential, if pushed
in the right directions.''
</P>
<P>
   One DivX fan named RogueOne wrote in an Internet post that he
has shown friends his illegal copy of the movie ``American Pie,''
but doesn't believe the format will ignite rampant movie piracy
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, RogueOne wrote, ``It's the digital age, boys and girls.
Anything that can be protected can be cracked. Stop whining and
figure out some other way to feel good about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Litvack, vice president of legal affairs for the Motion
Picture Association of America, said his group is concerned about
DivX.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking into it and need to determine from our various
options what method of attack we will use,'' Litvack said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said he still believes that most Americans are
law-abiding citizens and will not want to make illegal copies of
videos, he conceded that the motion picture industry is also going
to have to gear up its defenses for the new spate of technological
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's now clear to all of our members that they need to
be prepared to move at Internet speed, and I think you will see
they will,'' Litvack said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Hoffman, president of online music site EMusic.com Inc. of
Redwood City, Calif., believes the entertainment industry's best
chance of stopping piracy is to start selling downloadable video
and music, making it as easy and almost as cheap as getting illegal
copies.
</P>
<P>
   EMusic will announce today that it has sold 1 million legal MP3
songs since 1998, which Hoffman says shows there is a huge
potential market for legal downloadable entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to make gin in bathtubs during Prohibition,''
Hoffman said. ``Once they made it legal, nobody made bathtub gin.''

   &UR; Dougie &LR;  and  &UR; Gordon Millings &LR; , British tailors to the Beatles,
have authorized an Italian company to create a new ready-to-wear
line of suits based on ones made for John, Paul, George and Ringo.
Gordon Millings told GQ that the time seemed right for the suits
``because at the moment the Beatles films are being rereleased and
there is a huge interest in everything to do with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millingses' clothing for the Beatles ran from costumes
``from `A Hard Day's Night' and `Help!' to tour outfits, tuxedos
for royal command performances and getups for going to Buckingham
Palace to collect their MBEs in,'' he said. ``We were also doing
people like the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, the Who. Keith Moon died
in one of my suits. In fact, he hadn't paid for it.''

contains metal from recycled firearms.''

Lonely Hearts Club Band'' a social document of England. The
Beatles, writes Stansky, in prose that seems wistful now, ``can
tell us about the great strengths of English character, the English
vitality and imaginativeness, their ability to lead better and
better lives over the course of this century, both in a material
way, but also in the ways of the imagination.'' Furthermore (listen
up, ye Beatles' haberdashers), they appear, on the album cover,
``dressed in a triumph of gear.''

JEFF BURTON'S DAY A DUPLICATION OF HIS SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jeff Burton's systematic pursuit of NASCAR
Winston Cup points leader Bobby Labonte and victorious rookie Dale
Earnhardt Jr. emulated his own methodic ascent in the points
standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a nice and steady charge up to the front,'' Burton
said of his second-place finish in yesterday's DirecTV 500 at Texas
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's improbable charge from 37th to second place cemented
his fourth top-five finish and fifth-top 10 finish in seven Winston
Cup races this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't worry too much about where we qualify,'' Burton said.
``We knew we had a decent car. Right off the bat we were good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three races, Burton has climbed from 13th to sixth
in the point standings, and is second-leading money winner with
earnings of $2.7 million this season. Yesterday also marked his
third top-10 finish in four events at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   None of that comes as earth-shattering news to the No. 99 Exide
Ford team. Burton has been on the lip of Winston Cup greatness the
past three seasons, finishing fourth in the points standings in
1997 and fifth the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously an outstanding race-car driver and he continues
to show it on a weekly basis,'' Frank Stoddard, Burton's crew
chief, said. ``We got some points out of here, we gained on
everybody we needed to except for one \RLabonte\S. So based on that
we did what we needed to do for the points and that's what we're
here to do, to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's run to the front of the pack resulted from a steady
diet of conservative driving and a little luck. Stoddard said he
allowed Burton to become aggressive only when racing turned into a
single-file line where he could bob and weave his way through
traffic. His luck ran as strong as his car as he dodged much of the
trouble that drew a TMS record 12 yellow flags.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Burton to make his charge. By Lap 68, he
had jockeyed his way up 28 spots to ninth. By Lap 100, he was in
sixth and by Lap 200 he managed a brief lead.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed in the top five the rest of the way and was a
contender to win the race until Earnhardt Jr., made it clear no one
would catch him as he duplicated Burton's 1997 feat by making TMS
his first career trip to Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte battled long and hard to keep Burton in his rear-view
mirrow, but Burton took advantage when Labonte got pinched by a lap
car, enabling him to assume second place with 16 laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a chance to win, definitely, but I just
couldn't get by Bobby,'' Burton said. ```If I could have cleared
Bobby a little bit quicker then we could have given him \REarnhardt
Jr.\S a run for his money.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into next week's race at Martinsville, Va., Burton is 90
points behind his brother Ward, who sits in third. Jeff Burton
gained five points on Labonte to move within 180 points of the
points lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen overnight to contend for a
championship,'' Burton said. ``It' going to be a slow process.
Today was in the right direction.''

DRIVERS SAY IMPROVED TIRES MAKE DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway has not been kind to
Goodyear tires.
</P>
<P>
   During both Indy Racing League races last year, Goodyear tires
had blistering problems. And in last year's Winston Cup race at the
1.5-mile quadoval, several top teams suffered blowouts resulting in
wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   But in Sunday's DirecTV 500 Cup race at TMS, there was nothing
but praise for Goodyear and the tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were great ... awesome,'' said second-place finisher Jeff
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear brought two different tires for the tough TMS layout.
</P>
<P>
   The left-side tires on the Winston Cup cars were the same ones
used at Atlanta Motor Speedway. The right-side tires were specially
designed to withstand the speeds that TMS can produce and the
pressure the track exerts on the right-front tire, where there was
a big problem last year. Mike Skinner and Jeff Gordon both had
trouble with right fronts last year and ended up in the wall. Some
teams were running the tires under Goodyear's recommended tire
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   When drivers wrecked Sunday, it was not because of the tires.
The race concluded a weekend in which teams were not worrying about
tires or tire wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to salute Goodyear,'' said Larry McReynolds, Mike
Skinner's crew chief. ``We've got a tire. We had no problems, and
to my knowledge nobody had no problems and nobody had any problems
in the Busch race.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, teams had so much confidence in the tires, there were
several two-tire stops during the race.
</P>
<P>
   Winner Dale Earnhardt Jr. took on four tires at almost every pit
stop, but his teammate, Steve Park, had two two-tire stops. Park
said the car ran better on new right sides, instead of four new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept putting right sides on, and they just kept getting
better and better and better and it gave me track position,'' Rusty
Wallace said of the two-tire stops. ``We kept the right sides on
and led for a while, then started falling back. The left side tires
had about 80 laps on it, but she was still running good.''
</P>
<P>
   The new generation Goodyear Eagle, which was introduced at
Daytona, has been the subject of both praise and controversy this
season. Some people equate the boring races to the tires adhering
to the track better than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   TMS is one of those tracks where the asphalt is newer and still
has good grip, even though some consider it a one-groove track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to leave this tire alone,'' McReynolds said. ``I think
it's called averaging 180-something mph around a mile-and-a-half
racetrack. Dale Jr. ran some laps that would have qualified him
probably in the top 15 or so there the last part of the race.
That's awful fast, and that means your margin of error is small.''

RODRIGUEZ NOW THE MAN IN SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He made his major league debut at Fenway Park July 8,
1994, as an 18-year-old. Right away, one could tell Alex Rodriguez
was something special. But now, away from the shadow of Ken Griffey
Jr., traded from the Seattle Mariners, that will really show.
</P>
<P>
   With Griffey traded to Cincinnati, a new leader must be found,
and the clear choice of Mariners fans is Rodriguez. The amazing
shortstop who is a three-time All-Star and has a .308 career
average, with power, can hang around for a decade or so, say the
fans, even if he becomes baseball's first $200 million player.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have had a contract offer on the table since last
November. Rodriguez has elected to wait until the end of the 2000
season, become a free agent, and see what's available on the open
market. It's possible he could write his own ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``What direction the Mariners are going in the next four to five
years is something I am trying to assess,'' said Rodriguez. ``So
often it's the player who is evaluated. Only once or twice in your
career do you get to evaluate the (teams). I need to feel we have
an opportunity to win, and enough players in the right positions to
make a run the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's my contract year or not, I'm going to try and
give it my very best. I think my performance over the years has
said that. There might be some obligations on my end. I welcome
them. I love baseball and I love to play and compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's contract status has been a big story in recent
months. But with the Mariners set to start their first full year in
47,000-seat Safeco Field, what happens on the field becomes
paramount.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners host the Red Sox in their opener Tuesday night at
8.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will become his ball club now,'' said Mariners manager
Lou Piniella, who also has reached the final year of his contract.
``Alex has good leadership qualities. You know he will play hard
and he plays every day. You know he wants to win. But it's not
something we're going to force. We're going to let things take
their natural course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already know he can do everything as far as the skills are
concerned. There aren't too many players in baseball that have his
abilities. He's got power. He can hit for average. He can steal a
base and plays shortstop with good range, good hands, and an
excellent arm. There isn't much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``The Kid'' after his precocious debut in '94, he came
to the forefront two seasons later when he finished second in the
MVP race to Juan Gonzalez of Texas (a Seattle writer left him off
the ballot).
</P>
<P>
   He's batted .300 or better three times, including a league best
.358 in 1996. Twice he's hit 42 home runs, a record for AL
shortstops. Rodriguez might be the best of the outstanding current
shortstop class, which includes Nomar Garciaparra of Boston and
Derek Jeter of New York. Rodriguez's power is the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The exit of Griffey might not be the worst thing to happen to
the Mariners. Now that the team is out of the recently demolished
Kingdome, it can play a style more to Rodriguez's liking. Fans
might like that more than the nightly home run derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a better team,'' said Rodriguez. ``There is
more offense, more confidence, more security around here. We don't
just count on one or two people. The only pressure should be the
pressure to win. The fans deserve a winner. We want to give them
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be a more contact-oriented team. We'll hit-and-run.
We'll bunt a little more. We have to produce runs and not depend on
the long ball. To me, it was kind of a boring game just waiting for
the home run. We'll play more of a National League-style baseball
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez understands he isn't Superman, as Griffey often was
called, although sometimes it seems that way. Last year, he
suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee and underwent surgery and
was on the disabled list from April 7-May 13. But in his first
at-bat after his return, Rodriguez hit a home run. Without him,
Griffey might have struggled all year. But as the No. 2 hitter,
Rodriguez hit .295, and batting fourth he hit .282. He scored 110
runs and drove in 111. Despite missing 33 games, Rodriguez hit a
solid .285.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's definitely a great player,'' said John Olerud, a
free agent who played last year for the New York Mets. ``Alex has
put up great numbers every year. He's had consistency year in and
year out. I don't think he was overlooked just because Griffey was
here. I think everybody recognizes him as a great player. Maybe
he'll get more attention because Griffey is not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez says he's been around long enough to know not to pay
attention to predictions about his future, particularly when it
comes to a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, there will be another free agent out there,'' he
said. ``And he will be the most powerful or whatever. I can't worry
about that.''

have authorized an Italian company to create a new ready-to-wear
line of suits based on ones made for John, Paul, George and Ringo.
Gordon Millings told GQ that the time seemed right for the suits
``because at the moment the Beatles films are being rereleased and
there is a huge interest in everything to do with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millingses' clothing for the Beatles ran from costumes
``from `A Hard Day's Night' and `Help!' to tour outfits, tuxedos
for royal command performances and getups for going to Buckingham
Palace to collect their MBEs in,'' he said. ``We were also doing

Beatles, writes Stansky, in prose that seems wistful now, ``can
tell us about the great strengths of English character, the English
vitality and imaginativeness, their ability to lead better and
better lives over the course of this century, both in a material
way, but also in the ways of the imagination.'' Furthermore (listen

``dressed in a triumph of gear.''

GREGORY SHUKER, 67, DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., W.Va., Mass.)  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregory B. Shuker, a documentary filmmaker and pioneer in the
techniques of cinema verite, died on Wednesday at Calvary Hospital
in New York. He was 67 and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Nancy Shuker, his former wife.
</P>
<P>
   Shuker was among the first American filmmakers to use cinema
verite, a technique in which the camera discovers life without
predetermining it: Scripts are not used, subjects are not
rehearsed, and drama develops from daily experience.
</P>
<P>
   Shuker, who was born in Charleston, W.Va., began a career in
journalism at Northwestern University, where he worked on the daily
newspaper, becoming the editor in chief by the time he graduated in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   During college he went to the Soviet Union and provided
photographs and text to Life magazine. After serving in the Navy,
he began work in 1959 as a correspondent for Life, where he wrote
about Ernest Hemingway and bullfighting, the Project Mercury
program at NASA, and a presidential hopeful, Sen. John F. Kennedy
of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   While writing about the Indianapolis 500, he discovered the
magazine's experimental film unit and began making style-oriented
television programs. The unit, called Drew Associates, was founded
by the former Life photo editor Robert L. Drew. It was different
from other film crews because its members acted as their own
producers, sound recordists, film loaders and, later, editors.
</P>
<P>
   Shuker helped create some of the unit's most memorable films, in
particular ``The Chair,'' the tale of a condemned man, Paul Crump,
and the successful struggle of his novice lawyer to prevent his
execution. The work won the Grand Prix Award at the Cannes Film
Festival in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment'' cameras were
admitted to the offices of President Kennedy, Attorney General
Robert F. Kennedy and Gov. George Wallace of Alabama during the
confrontation over desegregation of the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   At President Kennedy's funeral Shuker, along with other
filmmakers from Drew Associates, turned their cameras not on the
funeral but on the mourners, creating the film ``Faces in
November,'' which won the Grand Prize at the Venice Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   He also produced ``Letters From Vietnam,'' a 1965 documentary
shot in combat and on board helicopters, and the ABC special
``Twiggy: Why?'' which theorized on the model's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Time-Life, Shuker worked at the Public Broadcast
Laboratory, the forerunner of PBS. There he produced ``Free at
Last,'' which chronicled the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
organization of the 1968 march on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The project took on a new form when King was assassinated, and
the 90-minute film became a document of his last days. The film was
hastily edited and shown three days after King's death, with Shuker
writing and providing the narration. The production won an Emmy
award as well as first prize at the Venice Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 Shuker helped found Playback Associates, which produced
industrial training videos and instructional tapes.

INVESTING: DIG DEEPER FOR MORE MEANINGFUL NUMBERS  &HT;     BY HARRY DOMASH
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The accounting fiasco at MicroStrategy underscores the
importance of investment research.
</P>
<P>
   The software company is in the red hot Internet
business-to-business sector. Unlike many Internet wonders,
MicroStrategy has been in business for some time and reported
positive earnings during each of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the company said recently that it is restating
both sales and earnings for 1998 and 1999 to conform to new
regulatory guidelines. As a result, its reported sales for 1999
will be cut by 25 percent, and the reported earnings may turn into
a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The bombshell sent MicroStrategy shares plunging to $72.31 on
March 21, down about 77 percent from its high of $313 less than two
weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   How could investors have seen this coming? Not by looking at
analysts' recommendations. According to information compiled by
Zacks Research, 9 of 10 analysts covering MicroStrategy had ``buy''
or ``strong buy'' recommendations on the stock when the bad news
broke.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK AT THE CASH: A good way to gain insight into a company's
health is by looking beyond reported earnings to cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   A company's reported earnings is subject to a myriad of
regulations and arbitrary accounting decisions that have a major
bearing on how it recognizes revenues, how fast it can depreciate
an asset, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Cash flow measures real money flowing into, or out of, a
company's bank account. Unlike reported earnings, there is little a
company can do to overstate its bank balance. Every company filing
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission is required to
include a cash-flow statement within their quarterly and annual
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC files the reports on its Edgar database as soon as they
are received. You can access them there (www.sec.gov) or on a
variety of other sites. My favorite place to view SEC reports is
Free Edgar (www.freeedgar.com).
</P>
<P>
   I like Free Edgar for two reasons: 1. access is free, and 2. it
provides a table of contents for each report. The company reports,
which can be lengthy, have a table of contents that is handy for
locating and printing sections of interest, such as the cash flow
statement. Companies file quarterly (10Q) and annual (10K) reports.
Always look for the most recent report filed.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET GUIDE: While the reports filed with the SEC include more
detail, Market Guide (www.marketguide.com) compiles the financial
information into a format that is easier to access and easier to
read.
</P>
<P>
   I will show you how to find cash flow information on Market
Guide using MicroStrategy as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Enter MicroStrategy's ticker symbol (MSTR) into the box labeled
``search for'' near the top-left of Market Guide's home page to
display the Snapshot page for MicroStrategy.
</P>
<P>
   Market Guide's Snapshot shows you useful information to help
evaluate a company, but we will save that for another column. Click
on Financials on the menu on the left to display Market Guide's
financial statement summaries for MicroStrategy.
</P>
<P>
   Scroll down past the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet to
the Statement of Cash Flows. When I looked last week, Market Guide
displayed columns for the fiscal years ending December 31 of 1996,
1997 and 1998, and for the 9-month periods ending September 30 of
1998 and 1999. The latest information is the most valuable, so the
9-month figures commanded the most interest.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the September 30, 1999, column. The top line is the
reported income, which shows in this case $8.864 million (the
figures are shown in thousands). That's the net income
MicroStrategy reported for the 9-month period.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of DOMASH03 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Look down four lines to ``Total Operating CF.'' That is the
amount of actual cash that flowed into, or out of, MicroStrategy's
bank account from operations during the period. In this case,
$2.459 million went out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reporting a profit, MicroStrategy's basic business,
selling software and services, used about $2.5 million more in cash
than it took in during the period.
</P>
<P>
   Now look down one line to Capital Expenditures, the cash used to
buy new plants and equipment. Some analysts say these outlays must
be taken into account, especially for technology companies, since
they must be continuously investing in new plants and equipment to
stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   These analysts subtract the capital expenditures from the
operating cash flow, to get ``free cash flow,'' the amount of
spendable excess cash generated by the company's operations.
</P>
<P>
   MicroStrategy's free cash flow for the 9 months ending September
'99 is a minus $28 million, meaning the company spent $28 million
more than it took in.
</P>
<P>
   MicroStrategy's recent problems are reportedly due to recording
sales prematurely, and that may account for the contrast between
reported earnings and actual cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   For comparison, while still on the Financials page, enter Cisco
Systems' ticker symbol (CSCO) into the ``Search For'' box at the
top-left and then scroll down to Cisco's cash flow statements. You
will see that Cisco had a positive operating cash flow of $2.715
billion and free cash flow of $2.3 billion for the 6-month period
ending January 29.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-growing companies may burn cash for justifiable reasons.
The SEC reports' management discussions often contain additional
information helpful in understanding why the cash is flowing out
instead of in.
</P>
<P>
   You can see that Cisco Systems is generating billions in excess
cash that can be used to develop new products, acquire
complementary companies, buy back stock, etc.
</P>
<P>
   MicroStrategy, on the other hand, is burning cash, and
eventually will have to get a refill, either by borrowing, or by
selling more stock. Neither option is good for stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe a stock price-to-cash flow ratio (stock
price/cash flow per share) is a better measure of value than the
traditional price/earnings ratio. I will show you how to search for
stocks based on price/cash flow in a future column.

JEAN KARL, 72, PUBLISHER OF BOOKS FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ill.)  (lb) 
 By EDEN ROSS LIPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean E. Karl, who established the publishing imprint Atheneum
Books for Young Readers in 1961 and led it until she retired in
1985, died on Thursday at a hospice in Lancaster, Pa. She was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Karl, who continued to edit books until recently, also wrote
extensively, including nonfiction, fiction and science-fiction
novels, mostly for children, under her own name, and other science
fiction as R.W. Munson (her grandmother's name).
</P>
<P>
   She left no immediate survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The author E.L. Konigsburg has described Karl as her ``forever
editor.'' As a young woman Konigsburg submitted two manuscripts to
Karl, who published both in 1967. ``The Mixed-Up Files of Basil E.
Frankweiler'' won the Newbery Medal the next year, while
``Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth''
was named a Newbery Honor book. Thirty years and 15 books later,
``The View From Saturday'' also won a Newbery Medal for Konigsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Karl oversaw or edited Newbery Medal books by Robert C. O'Brien,
Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, Cynthia Voigt and Maia Wojciechowska.
</P>
<P>
   She edited two Caldecott Medal books, ``May I Bring a Friend?''
by Beatrice Schenk de Regniers, illustrated by Beni Montresor, and
``A Story, a Story,'' by Gail E. Haley, as well as Ursula K.
LeGuin's ``Farthest Shore,'' which won a National Book Award.
Karl's books also won eight Edgar Awards. She was also the founder
of Aladdin Paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Karl was born and brought up in Chicago. She graduated from
Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   She began working in the editorial department of Scott, Foresman
in Chicago. In 1956 she moved to New York to be editor of
children's books at Abingdon Press, the publishing house of the
Methodist Church, and remained there until she was recruited by
Alfred Knopf Jr. to start the children's department at Atheneum.
Atheneum is now a children's imprint at Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that when an Atheneum executive called her the
``juvenile editor,'' she addressed him as ``senile editor,'' adding
sharply that ``good children's books are never juvenile.''

FRANCES GRAY PATTON, WRITER OF SHORT STORIES AND NOVELS, DIES AT
94
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.C., Md., Calif.)   (jw) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frances Gray Patton, a writer whose short stories appeared in
The New Yorker through four decades and whose works included the
popular 1954 novel ``Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' died Tuesday at
Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. She was 94 and lived
in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Potter's finely crafted stories offered glimpses into Durham
society in the mid-20th century, a world she knew well as a Duke
faculty wife. Her first published work, ``A Piece of Bread,'' the
story of a Southern girl's encounter with a prison chain gang, won
a Kenyon Review prize and was included among the 1945 ``O. Henry
Memorial Award Prize Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, The New Yorker began publishing Patton's stories, 30
in the next 10 years. Others appeared in magazines like Colliers,
Harper's, The Saturday Review of Literature and McCall's. Her first
book, ``The Finer Things of Life'' (1951), a collection culled
mostly from works that appeared in The New Yorker, earned praise
from critics.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Patton's first novel, ``Good Morning, Miss
Dove,'' was published. Developed from her story ``The Terrible Miss
Dove,'' first published in Ladies' Home Journal, the work
chronicles the life of a strict but beloved geography teacher in a
small American town whose sudden illness shocks the community.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times, Charles Poore described the work
as ``ruthlessly sentimental'' and ``a cheerful mixture of `Goodbye
Chips' and `Mary Poppins,' with touches of the rigorous way to
salvation from `Life With Father.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The novel was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and the movie
rights were sold to 20th Century Fox, which turned the story into a
popular film starring Jennifer Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Patton published ``A Piece of Luck,'' a second
collection of stories, set mostly in suburbia, that explored the
private worlds of children and women. A third collection, ``28
Stories,'' was published in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Frances MacRae Gray was born in Raleigh, N.C., where her father
was editor of The Raleigh Times. Her mother had been the first
woman to enroll at the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Patton became a writer by way of the theater. After high school,
she attended Trinity College, now Duke University, before enrolling
at the University of North Carolina, where she held a fellowship as
a playwright and was active in the Carolina Playmakers. Over the
years, she taught creative writing at both universities.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a son, Robert, of San Francisco; two
daughters, Mary Bogdonoff of Manhattan and Susannah Patton of
Bethesda, Md.; nine grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.

 BIOSCOPE: Coke Scion Protests Genetically Engineered Ingredients  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  One of the scions of the Coca-Cola Co. fortune has added his
voice to the chorus of protesters who want U.S. firms to quit using
genetically engineered ingredients, or to at least label their
products if they do.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Wardlaw III, grandson of one of the first investors
in Coke stock, has co-sponsored a shareholder resolution asking the
company to stop using genetic foods so long as questions remain
about the environmental and health effects of the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholder protest resolutions are generally floated by
investors with tiny holdings, but Wardlaw controls 2,020,682
shares, worth roughly $98 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time I've ever put through any sort of
shareholder resolution,'' said Wardlaw, whose grandfather was one
of the investors who helped Atlanta banker Ernest Woodruff take
Coke public in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   Wardlaw's protest is similar to six other resolutions that
religious groups, acting through New York's Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, have filed with McDonald's, General
Mills, PepsiCo, Quaker Oats, Sara Lee and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters in Europe, and more recently in the United States,
have said agribusiness firms moved too quickly to patent and sell
bioengineered crops, which contain pesticides that may make them
more profitable to grow but could pose unknown health or
environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
   Wardlaw said he was persuaded to add his prestige to the protest
by his longtime friend John Harrington, a board member of Global
Exchange, the San Francisco nonprofit group that promotes
alternatives to corporate practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really expect these resolutions to pass, but they
start to influence public attitudes,'' Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Coke management is urging shareholders to reject
Wardlaw's proposal, saying that there is no scientific basis to
think modified foods are unsafe and that a ban on such products
would tie the company's hands _ Coke buys corn syrup by the
tanker-full.
</P>
<P>
   Labeling, Coke says, would mislead and confuse consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Wardlaw's resolution, with arguments pro and con, can be found
at www.cocacola.com (click on ``Investor Relations,'' then ``Proxy
Statements'' and find pages 36 and 37 of the 2000 proxy).
</P>
<P>
   My thanks to Larry Crooks, a Richmond, Calif., resident and Coke
shareholder, for alerting me to this protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always amuse myself looking through the shareholder
proposals,'' said Crooks, who sees both sides of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   As an engineer, he understands that new technologies often have
bugs that don't get discovered until products hit the field. But he
doesn't want to hurt farmers by supporting corporate bans on buying
altered foods.
</P>
<P>
   So Crooks voted against the resolution, quoting the common
refrain, ``If you don't want to vote with management, you should
sell the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   FOOD FIGHT POSTSCRIPT: This week, the National Academy of
Sciences will release a long-awaited report on the health and
environmental risks of genetically modified plants, and the
scientific basis for decisions made by the three federal agencies
responsible for regulating them.
</P>
<P>
   The report will probably fuel rather than settle the debate. The
two sides are far apart, and no single report is likely to bring
them together.
</P>
<P>
   IN OTHER PROTESTS: Two weeks ago, BioScope focused on San
Francisco artist Marilyn Donahue, who is urging people to copyright
their DNA as a protest against the patenting of human genes.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Miller, a biology teacher at Oakland's Fremont High,
thought that provided a great lesson for the 80 students in his
10th-grade class. So he took them through the DNA copyrighting
process. He took a picture of each student in the act of licking a
stamp. The saliva became the DNA sample. The students then mailed
themselves these pictures. The unopened letters then became a
common law copyright, with the postmark proving the date of
``authorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of work with DNA,'' Miller said. ``Some of
these kids have spliced firefly genes into bacteria to make them
glow.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to showing students how to work with genetic
material, Miller said he wants to help them ``find their moral
compass'' on the many ethical issues raised by biotechnology,
patents being just one concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest transformation of technology since the
age of fire,'' Miller said. ``If, as a teacher, I didn't raise
these issues, I wouldn't be doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of Miller's 10th-graders, Marquitta Wesley, David Lopez
and Vanessa Hill, shared their thoughts on the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley, who hopes to become a doctor, said learning about all
aspects of DNA seems essential to a future medical career.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said the protest made sense to him. ``If genes are part of
what we are, I don't think a company can own them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said she objected to the fact that companies take DNA
samples from diseased patients and use these specimens to make
patented drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making millions and we're getting left out in the
cold,'' she said, adding that if more people did the DNA copyright,
the protests would signal public opposition.

DONALD TOWNSEND, 91, FOUNDER OF TAD'S STEAKHOUSE CHAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donald Townsend, who founded the Tad's Steakhouse
chain in 1957 on the theory that a T-bone, baked potato, garlic
bread and a tossed salad could be profitably sold for $1.09, died
March 25 in a Reno, Nev., hospital. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Little matter that the meat might be cardboard thin, with clumps
of fat and sinew. For a tenth the price of a fancy steak dinner, a
working man could watch his hunk of steer searing under leaping,
hissing flames in Tad's front window _ ``a steak show'' in
Townsend's memorable phrase. He could then savor it beneath red
velvet wallpaper and fake Tiffany lamps, dousing it with as much
steak sauce as seemed prudent. At Tad's peak, the chain had 28
restaurants, eight in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The concept had legs. Adjusted for inflation, the $1.09 price in
1957 would be $6.50 now, just 49 cents below today's price. The
Riese Organization, which bought Tad's in 1988, will open a new
Tad's on Times Square, its fifth in New York. If all goes well,
Riese hopes to expand nationally once again.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of Townsend's idea was evident at lunchtime the other
day at the Tad's on 42nd Street between Broadway and the Avenue of
the Americas. One man said he rode the subway at least once a week
from his home in the Bronx to eat in the restaurant. A family from
St. Louis said they had dropped in because they like the Tad's in
their hometown, one of the few still open outside of New York.
Kathryn Calise, who works in a nearby office, said: ``The food is
good. The price is good. It's comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Townsend's office was once directly over this restaurant. He had
two secretaries, one to handle business and the other to schedule
polo and the other elements of his brisk social life.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend was born in North Dakota in 1908. His father, a
rancher, died when he was 7. As the oldest of five children, he
went to work training trick ponies and helping haul coal. In his
teens, he went to Washington State, where he worked as a logger
until an injury to his little finger ended his logging career.
</P>
<P>
   He scrambled from job to job, selling diet pills in Australia
and opening some of Northern California's first drive-in
restaurants, among other things. For a brief time in his 20s he
worked for Borden's. One day, his boss, irritated at his
off-the-job business activities, demanded, ``Are you working for
Borden's, or are you working for Don Townsend?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm working for Don Townsend,'' came the reply. He
never worked for anybody else again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, Townsend joined with his brother Neal and a friend,
Alan Tadeus Kay, to open the first Tad's, its name taken from Kay's
middle name. Kay died soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend told the writer Sandra Hochman, who was his companion
for many years, that Tad's was based on several foundations besides
the ``steak show.'' One was marinating the meat in papaya juice to
tenderize inferior cuts of meat. Another was inventing tiles that
looked like charcoal over which to cook the meat; it was cleaner
than charcoal and allowed more even levels of heat.
</P>
<P>
   Tad's hired no advertising or public relations consultants,
relying instead on word-of-mouth recommendations. There were no
waiters, further cutting costs. Customers carried their own trays.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune magazine called Townsend ``the grandfather of the fast
foods business,'' and Ray Kroc, who built McDonald's into a
powerhouse, conferred with Townsend. One piece of advice Kroc got:
``You make more money selling to the Indians and not to the
chiefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Townsend and his brother later became involved in more business
ventures, including selling blue-green algae as a nutritional
supplement and marketing geothermal energy. In the late 1940s, he
developed an entire town, Cameo Acres, near San Francisco. He liked
to say that the centerpiece of his business strategy was, ``Get the
money up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Townsend lived in New York for 35 years; he moved to Reno to be
nearer his family after selling Tad's. With his immaculate dress,
shock of white hair and twinkling blue eyes, he was active in
fund-raising for the arts and politics. His own dining preferences
tended more toward Le Cirque than Tad's.
</P>
<P>
   His sense of humor could be wicked. He once had a denim jacket
made with a heart on the back, his phone number smack in the
middle. Hochman, who lived with the millionaire at the time,
remembered being less than charmed.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend's first wife, Lois, died many years ago; their sons,
Lance, of Hawaii, and Gordon, of northern California, and their
daughter, Donna Searby of Reno, survive him. His second wife, Leila
Townsend, from whom he was divorced, returned to be with him in his
final years, although they did not remarry.
</P>
<P>
   At the 42nd Street Tad's, the man who regularly visits from the
Bronx expressed pleasure that Tad's had survived the automats and
other New York City institutions like Orange Juliuses, which once
seemed to stand on every other corner. He saw no reason to give his
name, but said he was 59 and worked as a supervisor for the Transit
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This reminds me of when I was a youngster,'' he said. ``Tad's
Steakhouse is a monument.''

<P>
   Kenneth N. French, an actor who performed with many dance
companies, died March 22 at his home in Manhattan. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Joyce Herring, a friend and
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Albion, Okla., French came to New York in the mid-1950s
but continued to perform throughout the country in regional and
summer theaters.
</P>
<P>
   In New York he performed as an actor with the Pina Bausch
Tanz-theater Wuppertal at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and with
dance companies including Linda Mussmann's Time and Space Limited,
New York Theater Ballet, Yung-Yung Tsuai Dance Company and, most
recently, the Pascal Rioult Dance Theater, where he played the
wryly detached narrator of ``Fables.'' French also performed at
Symphony Space for several years in the annual ``Bloomsday on
Broadway'' and in ``Wall-to-Wall Renaissance.'' He appeared in six
television films on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Maggie Williams of Hot Springs, Ark.

<P>
   Mary Fowler Brennan, the widow of Justice William H. Brennan Jr.
of the Supreme Court, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Arlington,
Va. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan was born on Aug. 15, 1916, in Mechanicsville, Md., and
moved to Washington when she was 15. In 1943, she was hired by the
Supreme Court marshal's office, and was eventually promoted to the
secretarial pool, filling in for justices' secretaries who were on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   She met Justice Brennan when she was his temporary assistant
during his first weeks on the court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, Justice Brennan's secretary died and he asked Fowler if
she would work for him. Recalling her earlier, grueling stint in
his hectic office, she said yes, reluctantly. But their
professional and personal relationship blossomed, and she remained
his secretary for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, 1983, after Justice Brennan's first wife had died,
he and Miss Fowler were married.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan is survived by two sisters, Charlotte Harding of Lake
Ridge, Va., and Mary Jane Herring of Dale City, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Brennan died in 1997.

<P>
   Hans Gustav Gueterbock, a retired University of Chicago
professor who was one of the world's foremost scholars of the
languages of the ancient Middle East, died on Wednesday at his home
in Chicago. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Gueterbock was the university's Tiffany and Margaret Blake
distinguished service professor emeritus in the Oriental Institute
and the departments of Near Eastern languages and civilizations and
linguistics. He was also co-editor of the Chicago Hittite
Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Gueterbock specialized in the Hittites, a people of the ancient
Middle East who inhabited the central plateau of Anatolia, now part
of Turkey. The earliest Hittite texts, in cuneiform writing, date
from around 1600 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of his contributions to Hittitology, in 1996
Gueterbock became the second person to receive the American
Oriental Society Medal of Merit.
</P>
<P>
   Gueterbock was born in Berlin on May 27, 1908. He received a
Ph.D. from Leipzig University and was on the staff of the Berlin
Museum from 1933 to 1935. He left Nazi Germany the next year and
was a member of the faculty of Ankara University in Turkey from
1936 to 1948. He spent the 1948-49 academic year at Uppsala
University in Sweden and joined the faculty of the Oriental
Institute of the University of Chicago in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Gueterbock was president of the American Oriental Society in
1962 and president of the American Research Institute in Turkey
from 1968 to 1977. He was a member of the British Academy and the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Frances, of Chicago; two sons,
Thomas, of Charlottesville, Va., and Walter, of Scotts, Mich.; five
grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PHILADELPHIA _ Top-ranked Connecticut has a way of making a
mediocre opponent look even worse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday night, UConn made six-time NCAA champion Tennessee look
like an also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   Using a pressure-packed defense to disrupt the Lady Vols, the
Huskies breezed to a 71-52 victory before a sellout crowd of 20,060
at First Union Center to capture their second national championship
in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Geno Auriemma made all the right moves to cap a season in
which the Huskies were ranked No. 1 at the beginning and still
standing head and shoulders above everyone else at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is an indescribable feeling when you win something
like this,'' Auriemma said. ``Tonight when they had to do what
we've practiced all year long, they did it better than at any time
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we did it against a team that's as good and has as
much tradition as Tennessee makes it even better. This team was
intent on proving tonight they were the best in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn finishes 36-1, with the lone loss a 72-71 defeat by
Tennessee at midseason. Then, the Lady Vols played sluggishly
through the first half, rallied in the second and won on a
last-second shot.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the Huskies, who set a school record for wins in a
season, rendered Player of the Year Tamika Catchings _ and the rest
of her teammates _ virtually powerless. The loss was the
second-worst in a championship game in the 19-year history of the
women's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols (33-4) were seeking their fourth NCAA title in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   What they got were shots smacked back in their faces on a
routine basis by Kelly Schumacher and shots that could not be
launched without obstruction. Schumacher set a championship record
with nine blocks as UConn finished with a team-record 11 blocks for
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was fantastic,'' said Auriemma after the Huskies
limited the Lady Vols to 31-percent shooting and forced 26
turnovers that led to 30 UConn points.
</P>
<P>
   All-America guard Shea Ralph played with three fouls, all picked
up in the first half, and finished with a team-leading 15 points
and seven assists. All-American Svetlana Abrosimova scored 14
points, and reserve Asjha Jones had 12 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings, after scoring only five points for Tennessee in the
first half, led all scorers with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The victory provided Auriemma with his second national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was very special to me,'' said Auriemma, who grew up
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was forced to play without Kristen Clement, who
sprained an ankle during the morning practice, but coach Pat
Summitt said Clement's absence was not the reason the Lady Vols
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it have changed the outcome of this game? I can't say
that would happen,'' Summitt said. ``But she's a player who's
influenced the intensity and the attitude of our team. When we
started tonight, I thought it affected the way we handled the
press. When you look at it, we had 26 turnovers and most of them
came from our juniors and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also didn't knock down shots. (The Huskies) were just too
deep tonight. They rotated a lot of bodies on Catchings and had a
lot of fouls to use up on her.''
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, Ralph gave Catchings fits. Catchings went
without scoring until she hit a layup and a 3-pointer on
back-to-back possessions as the Lady Vols went on a brief spurt and
trimmed a 25-10 deficit to 28-19.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph picked up her third personal with 1:33 left in the first
half, hacking Kyra Elzy as she rebounded a missed 3-point try by
Sue Bird, who started in place of Clement. Elzy's two free throws
got Tennessee to within nine. But that only served to jolt the
Huskies back awake. Two baskets in the closing 40 seconds yielded a
32-19 lead for UConn at the break.
</P>
<P>
   At least four Connecticut players spent time chasing Catchings.
With she and Semeka Randall feeling the effects of the Huskies'
smothering defense, Tennessee's already ragged play got even worse
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   After leading by 13 at halftime, the Huskies opened the second
half with an 8-0 run and increased their lead to 42-22 after four
minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first five minutes, we could sense they were getting
tired,'' Abrosimova said. ``And we just kept on pressuring them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Summitt: ``Our guards were not strong enough to handle the
pressure defense they applied. Offensively, they just schooled us _
even some of our veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, this was a very disappointing performance by our
basketball team and a painful loss. This team has been very
competitive all year. Tonight, we just got into a situation that no
one expected.''

 LAWYERS IMMIGRATING TO THE NET  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The   San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  San Jose, Calif., attorney Bruce W. Burns used to have a
small practice helping immigrants get visas, green cards and other
documents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. He
worked mostly with people already living in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Then he put up a Web page, www.burnslaw.com, a simple site that
explains the basic kinds of visas available and prominently
displays his e-mail address. In the five years since he brought his
practice online, his client base has tripled and diversified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the Internet, our practice has expanded so that it
now includes the entire world. We get e-mails from every country,
even obscure countries in Africa and Asia,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is one of hundreds of immigration attorneys who have Web
sites. While Burns' online activity is limited to communicating
with clients via e-mail, many of his colleagues conduct major parts
of their practice online.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco immigration law firm Berry, Appleman &AMP; Leiden
allows clients to check the status of their case on the firm's Web
site by entering a password, the same way one would track a package
sent by Federal Express. Warren Leiden, one of the partners at the
firm, said that by using Web-based forms that they've created, he
can prepare applications in several hours that once would have
taken a week.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas of law, attorneys are just starting to
incorporate the Internet into their practices, but immigration
lawyers have been flourishing on the Web for several years.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Burns and his ilk are ahead of the curve is that
unlike most legal areas, immigration is governed nationally.
Immigration rules don't vary from state to state. So while a San
Mateo criminal lawyer can help clients only in California, Burns
can help anyone who sees his Web site, no matter what state or
country the client lives in. And since the Web can reach those
potential clients in Kathmandu, it's a more sensible advertising
vehicle for Burns than the San Jose Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, just as lawyers are using technology to speed up the
preparation of visa applications, the INS is backing away from
plans to speed up its processing by accepting applications
electronically. Receiving forms online instead of on paper would
save the INS time because it wouldn't need to type data from paper
forms into the INS computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The government agency originally hoped to accept electronic
applications by 2002 or 2003. But spokeswoman Eyleen Schmidt said
funds needed to switch to electronic forms will probably be used
instead to hire more processors and pay them overtime to reduce
huge backlogs in applications for naturalization and green cards.
</P>
<P>
   And a national pilot program meant to speed up the processing of
naturalization applications by letting applicants enter some
information on Web-based forms has been all but abandoned because
the system doesn't work well, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS does provide useful information online at
www.ins.usdoj.gov, such as updates on its complex rules and answers
to frequently asked questions. But several lawyers have dwarfed the
INS' official page with their own sites, which have become virtual
libraries of immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   At www.visalaw.com, Tennessee lawyer Greg Siskind has posted
3,000 articles explaining everything from how to adopt a child from
another country to which kind of visa is ideal for doing graduate
work in an American university.
</P>
<P>
   If potential clients _ or browsers _ can't find the information
they need from the articles posted, there are other options. On the
discussion board at Siskind's Web site, one can post visa questions
and get advice from other visa applicants or from Siskind himself.
Carl Shusterman, an attorney who practices in Los Angeles, answers
questions during live chats on his site, www.shusterman.com.
</P>
<P>
   While being online brings in new clients, it also means spending
many hours of unbillable time building up the Web site and
answering e-mails. Siskind, along with one other lawyer at his
firm, spends most of his time writing articles for the site and
answering the 200 to 300 e-mail messages he gets every day. He has
learned to code HTML (the language for Web pages) and spends many
late nights uploading news updates to the site.
</P>
<P>
   All of this casual interaction is unusual in law. In the past,
attorneys have usually offered their opinions only when they have
entered into a binding contract with a client. To avoid being held
responsible for any bad advice someone might get on a discussion
board or in a chat, the sites prominently post disclaimers such as
this one found on Siskind's site: ``Nothing included in these pages
should be construed as creating an attorney-client relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Railson of Berkeley, Calif., was impressed by the amount
of information she found on lawyers' sites when she researched ways
to prevent her husband, Sani, an Israeli national, from being
deported. Sani had overstayed his visa and is now being held in
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Without the articles and message boards, ``I wouldn't have known
there were so many other people in my situation,'' Railson said.
</P>
<P>
   She also used the Internet to locate a lawyer. She searched the
Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory at www.lawyers.com for attorneys
who specialize in visa law and e-mailed a description of her
husband's case to about 35 Bay Area lawyers. Within 24 hours, she
had heard back from nearly all of them, although only a handful
were interested in the case.
</P>
<P>
   She found that many of the immigration lawyers on the Internet _
including San Francisco's Berry, Appleman &AMP; Leiden _ focus solely
on getting visas for prospective employees of high-tech companies.
The attorneys get paid by the employers, who sometimes hire them to
handle paperwork for thousands of foreign employees.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees and poor immigrants, on the other hand, wouldn't find
as many online resources targeted at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our clients are low-income, working families, who do
not have access to the Internet,'' said Laura Wolff, a program
director at the International Institute of San Francisco, a
nonprofit organization that helps immigrants and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Some organizations use the Internet on behalf of low-income
immigrants who can't get Internet access themselves. Sara Campos,
staff attorney for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of the
San Francisco Bay Area, said that when her organization defends a
refugee asking for asylum in the United States, they research the
conditions of the refugee's home country using the Internet.
Siskind says a few refugee cases have come to him through his Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   He has also started hearing from would-be immigrants in
countries that in the past were too poor to get wired. In fact, his
e-mail newsletter has subscribers in most of the world's nations,
including Iran and Mongolia. Siskind says the only populous
countries he doesn't get subscribers from are North Korea, Cuba,
Libya and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Doing business with people from less-developed countries brings
new challenges. A major problem, San Jose's Burns said, is getting
people from such countries to understand that he has to operate by
American business practices and get paid at U.S.-level prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the person is living in the Ukraine, their concept of what
a lawyer should be paid is different from our concept in Silicon
Valley,'' said Burns, who often receives requests for creative
payment arrangements. Some entrepreneurs promise to pay him once
they've set up a successful business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While such an arrangement is out of the question, ``sometimes we
can reduce the fees somewhat,'' Burns said.

 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Tony Parker, his American-sounding name aside,
was just like every other kid growing up in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played soccer,'' he says. ``In France, soccer is the No. 1
sport, so I played soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   And then came the Barcelona Olympics, the Dream Team, and all
that. Bonjour, basketball. Adieu, soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I switched because of Michael Jordan, the things he could do
with the ball,'' Parker explains. ``After seeing that, I wanted to
play basketball. In 1996, I came to Chicago and had my picture
taken with him. It's hanging in my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it didn't hurt that Parker's dad, Tony Sr., was a Chicago
native who had played at Loyola before embarking on a professional
career in Europe. Genes never hurt (See Kobe Bryant). But Parker
the Elder was not the pushy type. ``He let me do what I wanted to
do,'' young Parker says.
</P>
<P>
   So it was exposure to the Dream Team that led to Tony Parker
being in the Conseco Field House Sunday, scoring 20 points and
handing out seven assists as his International team of junior
players was losing an entertaining 98-97 game to a USA squad. It
was the sixth annual Hoop Summit, which is held each Final Four
Sunday, and for anyone who'd like to get a glimpse of where the
game is heading, it really ought to be a must see.
</P>
<P>
   International coach Allessandro ``Sandro'' Gamba, a charming
Italian who was captain of the 1960 Italian Olympic Team, knew
exactly what was going to happen in Europe, and elsewhere, once
people got a look at the Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played in the 1960 Olympics,'' he says, ``I played
against the first Dream Team, the one with Oscar Robertson, Jerry
West, and Jerry Lucas. We actually played them twice, in both the
quarterfinals and semifinals. We drew inspiration from that team.
So when the 1992 Dream Team came along I knew what would happen.
You (in America) have idea. The kids wolf it all down. In my
opinion, the Dream Team was the best thing to happen in basketball.
It was a big show, and kids are attracted by the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunsday's USA victory included a pair of debatable noncalls in
the final minute that might have altered the game, not least a
putback of a forced Parker airball at the buzzer by Serbian Goran
Cakic, who slammed the ball down in disgust when no foul was
affixed to his basket. An overtime probably would have been the
proper way to go, so wonderfully skilled and competitive was this
game.
</P>
<P>
   The series now stands 4-2 in favor of the USA team, but there
are important factors to consider, and Gamba, who has been the
International coach from the beginning, is quite willing to
enumerate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we played in Europe, we could win some of these games,'' he
insists. ``There is a difference in the mentality of officiating,
not that this is a lamentation. We would have the support of the
crowd. We always play these games on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more. This is, after all, USA vs. The World. Gamba's
squad included players from Croatia, Canada, France, Spain,
Yugoslavia, Latvia, Qatar, Slovenia, Australia, Nigeria, Senegal,
and England. With better luck, he also would have had key players
from China and Russia at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practiced for five days,'' he says. ``It was a matter of
communication. We had to teach and demonstrate everything on the
floor. It does help that in basketball the universal terminology is
English. But it is not easy. That's why I am happy we had an
identity today. We played as a team, not just a bunch of players in
an All-Star game.''
</P>
<P>
   The team he was up against had some really interesting players,
most notably Zach Randolph, a 6-foot-9-inch, 270-pound combination
of wide-body load and ballerina finesse. Randolph, fresh off an MVP
performance in Wednesday's McDonald's game at the FleetCenter, had
a game-high 24 points, 8 rebounds, and 3 assists. It is quite easy
to see why his Marion (Ind.) High team won its state championship,
and why Michigan State coach Tom Izzo will start looking forward to
next season as soon as Monday night's championship game is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Other Americans who impressed included a pair heading to St.
John's, guard Omar Cook (14 points, 6 assists), and smooth forward
Darius Miles.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone in attendance had to come away realizing that we
simply do not own this game any longer. We are not in immediate
jeopardy of losing an Olympics because no one country has enough
top-level players within its own borders to give the NBA stars a
game. But a game like this demonstrates just how much general
talent is out there.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every player on the International roster would have
strong appeal for most of the many college coaches taking in this
game. You'd start with Nigerian center Olumide Oyedeji, a 6-10
swatter (19 points, 13 rebounds) who intends to apply for the NBA
draft. You'd also drool over forward Abdou Diame of Senegal, but
he's already spoken for (Auburn). The aforementioned Cakic has some
serious hops and inside moves. Croatian guard Marko Popovic ran the
team and popped in three 3-pointers. Australian Andrew Rice
demonstrated a soft shooting touch and nice moves. And then there
was our man Parker, who drew many ohh-la-las with some poised
all-around guard play. He shot it deep, he penetrated, he hit open
men, and he acted as if he'd been in the NBA for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He won't be 18 until May, but he is aware in that classically
European way, and he knew he had accomplished what he set out to do
when he walked onto the floor. He had come with two purposes: win
the game and audition for Whatever, be it an American college or
anyone else who'd like his services over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were college scouts and NBA scouts here,'' he says,
``and now they will know me and maybe in three or four years they
will remember me and know I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he can play, all right. And he's not the only one.
Basketball is no longer just our game. It's everyone's game.

CRASH COSTS NASCAR ROOKIE HIS CHANCE AT TOP 10 FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ All the ingredients appeared to be in place
for Scott Pruett's first top-10 finish in a NASCAR Winston Cup
Series event.
</P>
<P>
   Fast car? The No. 32 Tide Ford qualified third Friday for
Sunday's DirecTV 500.
</P>
<P>
   Suitable track? Texas Motor Speedway's 1.5-mile quadoval
appealed to the former CART veteran.
</P>
<P>
   No foolhardy charge by a driver in his rearview mirror? Oops.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you very much, Steve Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unfortunate set of circumstances where we just got
caught up with a guy not using his head,'' said Pruett, who led
laps 4-16 before being nudged from behind by Park's No. 1 Pennzoil
Chevrolet on Lap 18. Pruett's car spun and slammed into Turn 4,
which resulted in significant damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1 car took us out,'' Doug Richert, Pruett's crew chief,
said. ``The 1 car is underneath us, and it's way too early in the
race to be running us that hard. We're just up here. We're making
laps. We made the race. We just wanted to run good, and
unfortunately the guy was a little too impatient ``way'' too
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett went to Park's hauler in search of an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was underneath Scott, and his spotter did not let him know I
was there,'' Park said. ``He looked like he was real loose and
trying to gather his car, and when he got loose, he came down and
got into me and I got into him. It was a racing deal. It was
unfortunate that it happened. We talked and straightened things out
so we can continue to race next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Pruett deemed the nudge unacceptable for that
stage of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five hundred miles is a long way,'' said Pruett, who finished
27th. ``In all the forms of racing I've been in, when you're four
to five laps into it, there's a lot of give and take. There are a
lot of miles left to go, and you just give each other a little
break. That didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett's crew salvaged 87 Winston Cup points with their efforts
during an estimated 15 pit stops throughout the afternoon,
including five during the five-lap caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``An unfortunate set of circumstances cost us a top-10 finish,
but the guys worked 110 percent all day long,'' said Pruett, a
NASCAR rookie whose career achievements include SCCA Trans AM, IMSA
GTO, IMSA GT Endurance and Professional Karting Association
championships. ``Even after it crashed, we were running fast. We
were running within two- or three-tenths (of a second) of the
leader with a crashed race car. We had a good car.'' nn

BRYANT GETS IN FIGHT DURING LAKERS ROUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The knockout punch was delivered long before the
fists started to fly Sunday, but a 30-second exhibition bout staged
in the middle of the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the New York
Knicks left the more lasting impression, and left both teams
bloodied.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won the game, a 106-82 rout, but lost their dazzling
21-year-old star when Kobe Bryant was ejected for a third-quarter
scuffle with Knicks guard Chris Childs. And with an NBA-imposed
suspension all but certain, the Lakers probably will lose Bryant
for at least one game, probably Tuesday at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided victory at Staples Center was no surprise. Seeing
the 21-year-old, ever-composed and good-natured Bryant come unglued
on the court qualified as the biggest shock of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But after Bryant absorbed a head-butt to the chin and two fists
to the face from Childs, no Laker blamed him for swinging back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows Kobe's a clean-cut kid,'' teammate Shaquille
O'Neal said. ``The guy hit him first and then you expect to let
somebody punch you in the face on national TV and expect him not to
do anything about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant did, or tried anyway. His return punch never connected,
and a scrum led by officials Ted Bernhardt and Ron Garretson
corralled the furious Bryant before he could get close to Childs
again. Lakers assistant coach Jim Cleamons stepped in as well, and
teammate Ron Harper tried cooling Bryant off as they headed back
toward the bench, but cameras showed Bryant still yelling and
pushing away O'Neal's bodyguard, Jerome Crawford, on the way to the
locker room afterward.
</P>
<P>
   It was an image of Bryant never seen to this point in his
four-year pro career, and his first ejection. Bryant didn't stick
around to explain his emotions to reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's supposed to react,'' coach Phil Jackson said, ``Probably
not with a fist. You get into it, grab a guy, push him away,
whatever you want to do.... It's pretty much a natural reaction for
a player that takes a punch that doesn't see it coming, that he's
going to react to it. But it's probably human instinct for players
at least at this level to react aggressively to something like
that, so I'm not surprised that any player would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   All the mayhem diverted attention from the main event - the
Lakers thoroughly dominating the Knicks for a season sweep of their
potential sparring partner in the NBA Finals. In doing so, the
Lakers (62-12) got their ninth consecutive victory, 14th straight
at home, and reduced their magic number for clinching the league's
best record to two.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's 34 points and 12 rebounds led the thrashing, which saw
the Lakers up by 14 late in the third. They were up by 71-60, with
43.4 seconds to go in the quarter, when things got ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Lakers' Glen Rice and Harper had mixed it up with
the Knicks' Patrick Ewing in the first quarter, resulting in
technical fouls for Ewing and Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the Knicks play, they always play that way,''
Harper said. ``Hard-nosed basketball. I'm not mad at them, that's
just how they play.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rice: ``Teams are going to do whatever they can to try to
provoke us and try to get us off-balance in some kind of way. It
just didn't work today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were working on offense when Childs and Bryant
exchanged shoves near the baseline in the vicinity of the Knicks'
bench. As they went chest-to-chest, Childs threw the head-butt to
Bryant's chin, Bryant responded with a left elbow to Childs' mouth,
and Childs threw a right-left combo, landing at least the first
one. Childs ducked Bryant's return swing, and the fight was broken
up from there, while O'Neal gave a hard shove to Ewing on the
outskirts of the melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit me with an elbow in the mouth, and I just reacted,''
Childs said. ``He does it a lot and never gets called for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said officials were partly responsible for the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the referees didn't do the kind of job they should
do in the third quarter, for whatever reason, and it got out of
hand,'' he said. ``There were some fouls that probably should have
been called but were ignored, and I don't know if they were trying
to make the (game end in time for the) 6 o'clock news time or what,
but those are the things that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's response left an impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood up for himself,'' teammate Rick Fox said. ``He was a
little frustrated there that he couldn't get a piece of Chris
Childs. Kobe being such a nice guy, a nice kid, I suspect it had to
be something pretty serious that happened for him to respond that
way.... I've seen Kobe upset, at refs, in the competitive heat of
the battle. But he's always had a composed way about him in a game
situation.... That's not his caliber of response.''

NO WIN, BUT LABONTES LEAVE TMS WITH PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Terry and Bobby Labonte had hoped to make a
statement. But while neither driver won the DirecTV 500, they also
didn't leave Texas Motor Speedway empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby, who finished third, left retaining his points lead.
Terry, who was eighth, left with his first pole in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was definitely an important race for us,'' Bobby said.
``... But I can't really complain about it. It was a good day _ a
really good day. We just want to do like everybody else and win
here or win there and win everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day but a good weekend for the Labontes.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was father-son day at the racetrack. Dale Earnhardt Jr.,
driving for his father, won the DirecTV 500.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Labonte had nothing for Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Terry didn't have the engine. Bobby didn't have the
aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were off,'' said Terry, whose last victory came here last
year. ``Our car was just not fast. ... Earlier in the race I ran
some with Dale Jr., but I couldn't ever get close enough to him at
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry did have his No. 5 Kellogg's Chevrolet up front for the
start.
</P>
<P>
   He set a Cup qualifying record at TMS, with a 192.137 mph lap
Friday. It was his first pole since 1996, when he was the fastest
qualifier at Sonoma, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   He had lobbied for the engine the team used in the race, but it
developed a problem during the DirecTV 500. He would have figured
that out Saturday afternoon had Winston Cup's Happy Hour practice
not been canceled by rain. Instead, the No. 5 team realized they
were horsepower-out-of-luck early during Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew right off that we were in a little bit of trouble,''
crew chief Gary DeHart said. ``We just weren't as good as we
thought we were going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the eighth-place finish was his worst in four starts at
TMS, Terry wasn't looking his gift horsepower in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going to run for the points, on a bad day, if you
can get a top 10, that's good,'' Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby's No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac was as good as he
expected. It just wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came time to go, no, we didn't have anything,'' crew
chief Jimmy Makar said. ``It was pretty obvious there at the end
that he (Earnhardt Jr.) had a lot left and a lot more than what we
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our car wasn't perfect at the end. We were a little too tight.
But I think even with our car perfect, we probably would have
finished second.''
</P>
<P>
   The Joe Gibbs Racing team argues that the Pontiacs are
handcuffed by an aerodynamic disadvantage, and they are campaigning
for some concessions from NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran decent but just not quite fast enough,'' Bobby said.
``We just kind of didn't have it all there (Sunday). We had about
50 cards out of a 52-card deck, and I think NASCAR is holding the
other two cards from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to play with what we've got. We had the best
car in class. I just wish we had a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   He had enough to hold onto the points lead. Bobby's third-place
finish was his sixth top-10 finish in seven races, and gave him an
84-point advantage over Mark Martin in the season standings.
</P>
<P>
   And next weekend at Martinsville, Va., everyone will be trying
to catch him. nn

FIGHT MIGHT KEEP JACKSON'S PLAN OUT OF ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Coach Phil Jackson proclaimed his team
playoff-ready. Their ability to survive Kobe Bryant's third-quarter
ejection solidified that assertion, but Bryant's punishment
probably will throw a crimp in the Los Angeles Lakers' postseason
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been looking for the right time to rest veteran
guard Ron Harper before the playoffs, and he had resolved to place
him on the injured list before Tuesday's game at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant's fight with the Knicks' Chris Childs will probably
net at least a one-game suspension, and without Harper, the Lakers
would be down to Derek Fisher, Brian Shaw and rookies John
Celestand and Devean George.
</P>
<P>
   ``(We) probably won't be able to put Harper on the IR like we
planned to, or at least scoped it out to be, because Kobe probably
will be suspended a game,'' Jackson conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Said Harper, ``I guess I ain't getting any time off, huh?... I'm
fine. I'm fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant left without speaking to reporters, but asked how Bryant
felt, Jackson said, ``He's feeling like he's probably going to miss
out on a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The positive side for the Lakers was they survived without
Bryant, who had 17 points, eight assists and six rebounds. The
Lakers had an 11-point lead when he was ejected - two Glen Rice
jumpers extended the lead to 75-60 heading into the fourth, and
they finished strong, with an eight-point quarter from Harper and
seven points from Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We responded very well at the end of the third quarter. Glen
got on a roll and Harper did a great job,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   East is least: Sunday's game was the Lakers' last against an
Eastern Conference opponent, and they finished with a 27-3 record
and a .900 winning percentage that stands as the best in NBA
history for a West team against the East.
</P>
<P>
   They also went 5-1 against the East's three top teams
</P>
<P>
   the Knicks, Miami Heat and Indiana Pacers, the latter dealing
the only loss. What does that say about the Lakers, who could face
one of the above in the Finals?
</P>
<P>
   ``That at whatever point we played them during the course of the
season, we were a better ballclub than they were,'' Jackson said
wryly.

REVOLUTION WILL LACK FOOT SOLDIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Revolution are acting less and less like one of
Major League Soccer's worst teams. They not only held the Los
Angeles Galaxy to a 2-2 tie after threatening to turn the match
into a rout Saturday night in Pasadena, Calif., they returned to
Boston feeling like underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is disappointed,'' coach Fernando Clavijo said
Sunday. ``Before the game, if you said we would get out of there
with a tie I would have said, `Great.' But we played well enough to
really put them away and I look at it like we lost 2 points.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a major change in attitude for a team that had not
defeated Los Angeles since July 4, 1996. Since then, the Revolution
have been outscored, 22-7, and have earned only 2 of a possible 27
points against the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution's confidence will be tested when they visit
Dallas Saturday without defender Ivan McKinley and midfielder
Mauricio Ramos (both suspended), and striker Fabio Zuniga (sprained
right knee).
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution imposed their game on the Galaxy, and Leonel
Alvarez stifled Salvadoran midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos for much
of the first half. Alvarez scored his first MLS goal since 1996,
volleying in a rebound of a Ramos free kick. And Wolde Harris
finished a Ramos through ball for a 2-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The goals were the result of a cohesive Revolution attack. And
their advantage could have been greater _ Imad Baba hit the post
off a corner kick in the first half, and Ted Chronopoulos beat
goalkeeper Kevin Hartman with a looping shot off the crossbar early
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chronopoulos's shot could have put the game away at 3-0, but
it didn't happen,'' Clavijo said. ``Then, we lost our composure and
didn't play as well in the second half as we did in the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Zuniga departed in the 33d minute, but substitute Johnny Torres
sparked the team by drawing a free kick four minutes later that
resulted in the first goal. But Clavijo had few options, especially
after McKinley was ejected by referee Brian Hall after a clash with
Costa Rican midfielder Roy Myers in the 78th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Eduardo Hurtado missed the game because his family was
experiencing visa problems in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was luck or experience, but I made sure we
traveled with enough players, because I thought something might
happen,'' said Clavijo, who brought 16 players on the trip as a
precaution against the availability of Hurtado and William Sunsing.
``We played good soccer in these last two games and we didn't go to
Tampa or Los Angeles hanging back and playing defense. This team
has character and we have some fighters. This was only our third
game together for 90-plus minutes and I'm pleased. When you go on
the road for four games and you have a chance to win one, lose one,
and tie two, that's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaker Asad likely will audition for Ramos's playmaking role
when the Revolution play a scrimmage against the Connecticut Wolves
Tuesday. The Revolution are 0-1-2, third in the Eastern Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to look for excuses,'' Clavijo said. ``We have 23
players on the roster who can contribute at any given time. I have
no problem with McKinley and Ramos because of the situation they
were in _ you look at what LA did and they get away with murder,
and we touch somebody and get a red card. Somebody (Hall) in the
middle of the field is making those decisions, and sometimes we are
going to get the call our way and sometimes we are not. But we lost
our composure.
</P>
<P>
   ``McKinley should have kept away from a confrontation because he
already had a yellow card, and Ramos knew he could not get another
yellow. They are mature guys and should know better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado, who was with Ecuador's national team Wednesday,
returned to New York Sunday &UR;  &LR; night and is expected to move into a
Boston-area apartment Monday, his agent, Eric Manasse said. ``They
would not let his family get on the plane in Ecuador,'' Manasse
said. ``His wife had to go to the American Embassy and, since she
does not speak English well, she called Eduardo to go with her. The
problem was that the (MLS) office screwed up on the visas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado informed Revolution public relations director Jurgen
Mainka of his family's visa problems Friday. But Clavijo had not
heard from Hurtado since then. ``I want to get all sides of the
story before making a decision,'' Clavijo said. ``I need to get all
the facts from the league, about who is responsible for the
paperwork for his family.''

TWO-FOR-ONE SPECIAL IN FINAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ One game. Two styles. Endless possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Monday night's final game of the college basketball
season, starring a Michigan State team in the role of favorite
simply because none of the other high seeds in the NCAA tournament
survived, most of them not even reaching the regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Co-starring is a University of Florida team that has shined even
as its school still carries more of a football heritage.
</P>
<P>
   There's more, of course, to come from the festivities in the RCA
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Florida. Surely you know most of the story of
Billy and his Kids, 10 of them freshmen or sophomores who have been
so precocious in five tournament victories, including a systematic
demolition of Duke and North Carolina, two of the more storied
programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The misconception is that Florida's recent success under
34-year-old coach Billy Donovan makes the Gators a rising
basketball power.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. Look at how the Gators have reached the first national
championship game in school history _ using a 10-player rotation,
platoon basketball, even alternating point guards the way Gators
football coach and Florida basketball fan Steve Spurrier alternates
his quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Duke learned that a week ago when the Gators' Run 'N Fun offense
overwhelmed it in the final minutes. North Carolina learned it
Saturday night when the Tar Heels, who use a six-player rotation,
didn't have enough bodies or stamina to avoid becoming the latest
Gator bait.
</P>
<P>
   Now Florida (29-7) is 40 minutes from adding another national
championship trophy to the display case back in Gainesville.
Donovan says he doesn't want to talk about how much fun the ride
has been. At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I don't want to enjoy it,'' said Donovan, who 13
years ago was a player on a Providence team that also was chasing a
championship dream. ``I want to exhaust every possible avenue I
have as a coach to try and put these guys in the best possible
position to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't focused on the fact that we're 40 minutes away from
a national championship. It's probably more we're playing Michigan
State and what we have to do to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take a lot. Michigan State (31-7) has won 10 straight
games, the last six by double-digits, including Saturday night's
53-41 grinder over Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans come after you early. And while they are more
plodding than the Gators and certainly don't go 10 deep in their
rotation, they have shown a tendency to put teams away with a late
rush that overwhelms them the way the Gators have the past few
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin game, perhaps because it was the fourth meeting of
the teams, perhaps because the defensive style of the Badgers was
conducive to hand-to-hand combat, was more a game of attrition than
one of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Even Michigan State coach Tom Izzo knew the victory over the
Badgers would not win many style points.
</P>
<P>
   When he came out of the locker room at halftime of a game in
which Michigan State held a 19-17 lead, Izzo spotted Northwestern
coach Kevin O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you like the Rose Bowl?'' joked Izzo.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's game might be like the Citrus Bowl, in which
Michigan State won a wild and often contentious 37-34 victory over
the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Expect more of the same with the basketball teams. Michigan
State, dominated by senior point guard Mateen Cleaves and forwards
Morris Peterson and A.J. Granger, realizes this is the last hurrah
for a group that has won 103 games in college.
</P>
<P>
   Not getting win No. 104 is not an option. ``We were disappointed
with the loss to Duke last year (in the Final Four semifinals),''
said Granger, ``and we used it as a motivation in preseason. It
finally hit just how long we had left when we played our last home
game against Michigan. Hopefully we can dull the pain of leaving by
trying to go out on a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be remembered as champions. No one remembers who
came in second.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators also want a championship. They reached the regional
semifinals a year ago, which gave them a taste of what they might
win Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, a master motivator, has used all sorts of tools to
prepare his team. A week ago, he showed the Gators a film of the
Ali-Foreman fight. On Friday, he got into the football mode and
showed them ``Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Teddy Dupay offered a suggestion for a pregame movie
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll see `Home Alone,' '' he said. ``Some young kid
defending his house.''

WALSH HAS TITLE IN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MONAHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   University of Maine cocaptain and forward Brendan Walsh of
Dorchester has a lot on his mind while awaiting the Black Bears'
NCAA Frozen Four semifinal-round game against North Dakota
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about cocaptain Corey Larose, who has to sit out
because of a butt-ending penalty he took March 26 during a 5-2 win
over Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about last year's semifinals against Boston College in
Anaheim, Calif., when his Eagles friend Andy Powers put him out of
the finals with a check that buckled his patched-up knee. Maine
went on to defeat New Hampshire, 3-2, in overtime, to win the
title.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks back to his days playing for Catholic Memorial, his 1
1/2 years at Boston University, his sitting out a year after
transferring to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about his grandfather, Joe Walsh of 6th Street in
South Boston, who ``gave me the urge to be competitive,'' Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll miss Corey big time,'' Walsh added. ``It's frustrating.
He's a catalyst for us. He's been there and he's a silent
motivator. We'll miss him and his locker room presence. Corey is
special. He's always been a spark, and he does everything well _
passing, shooting, checking. He's a great leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what Coach (Shawn) Walsh does is he carries a larger team
traditionally. We've been working with different guys lately, and
hopefully everything will fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a well-coached team, and we can adapt to adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened last year?
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke my kneecap in November of 1998 against New Hampshire
in the Governor's Cup,'' said Walsh, ``and I took four weeks off
and had a screw put in. And I was playing with it broken the rest
of the year, and the screw was holding the bone together. In that
semifinal game, I cut across the blue line, and Andy got the better
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was at the final but was in the stands. He wanted to be on
the bench with his teammates, but he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult,'' he said. ``It was one of those bittersweet
deals. It was tough, but the way we play and the system we have,
it's not so much what you have on the back of your jersey, (it's
what's on) the front of your jersey. It may sound corny these days,
but that's basically the system we play. We're a complete team, and
you never know who is going to make that big play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't place any individual stats on the walls in the
locker room. There's nothing there that points out any individual
categories. It's been like that since I've been at Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh butted heads with coach Jack Parker at BU over what the
player termed ``minor rules violations. It was basically
philosophical differences.''
</P>
<P>
   He's done well at Maine, and he is excited to be facing North
Dakota Thursday at the Providence Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the way the team is playing right now,'' he
said. ``Back in January we had that tough skid, and Coach Walsh
just told us we control our own destiny. We've done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back in that Hockey East tournament final and we're
scoring big goals. And we're getting scoring from different guys
every night.''
</P>
<P>
   When Maine ousted Michigan in the regionals, it had scorers on
every line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been a characteristic of our team,'' said Walsh.
``We're not relying on any given guy on any given night.''
</P>
<P>
   Maine trailed Michigan, 2-0, after two periods in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not all that worried, really,'' said Walsh. ``That was
the most comfortable I've ever been being down two goals going into
the third period. I'm not cocky, but we knew that conditioning
would come into play. Michigan played late the day before. We
outlasted them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Walsh has lots on his mind these days. It's the final
weekend of his collegiate hockey career. He'll miss not having
Larose on the ice Thursday. He hopes to play in a final for his
last hurrah. And he hopes his grandfather will see Maine win
another national title.

IS VARGAS EXPERIENCED ENOUGH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One question arising from the rubble of Felix
Trinidad's demolition of David Reid is this: How much experience is
necessary to cope with boxing's elite champions?
</P>
<P>
   Reid had only 14 fights behind him when he stepped into the ring
last month and it showed. He was unable to cope with his powerful,
savvy opponent in the second half of the fight and lost decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Is Fernando Vargas of Oxnard, who faces Ike Quartey on April 15
in Las Vegas, in for a similar fate?
</P>
<P>
   Vargas has fought only 18 times (18-0, with 17 knockouts) over
three-plus years. Quartey, while no Trinidad in the eyes of most,
has fought 36 times (34-1-1, 29 KOs) over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   And Vargas certainly hasn't faced the likes of Quartey. He's
beaten tough, but limited Yory Boy Campas and Raul Marquez and
narrowly outpointed wily Winky Wright in his last fight.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey has been in the ring with Oscar De La Hoya - a fight
some believe he won - and talented Jose Luis Lopez, with whom he
drew.
</P>
<P>
   These are facts to which Quartey couldn't resist pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who has he fought? He doesn't have the experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wright fight, in December, certainly raised eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas claims he was unable to focus because of family problems.
And, to be fair to Wright and Vargas, the left-hander is more
skilled and tougher than many imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some wonder whether the fact Vargas had to pull out the
fight in the final rounds against a relatively unknown challenger
is an indication he needs more work.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made (that fight) tougher than it had to be,'' he said. ``I
was mentally drained for that fight. I'm not taking anything away
from Wright. He's the slickest southpaw in the game with the
exception of Pernell Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't there that night. I was only 50 percent. And,
still, I showed that I'm a champion when the championship rounds
came.
</P>
<P>
   ``...I showed the world I can win even on a bad night.''
</P>
<P>
   That experience should help Vargas: He knows what it's like to
be in a tough fight and what it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   And, in comparison to Reid, there are other reasons to believe
he won't fall apart as his 1996 Olympic teammate did against
Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas will have had four more fights going into his big moment.
It's not much but it is a full year of boxing at the championship
level, at which the top names fight about four times a year.
</P>
<P>
   And, while Campas, Marquez and Wright aren't frightful
opponents, they are collectively better than that which Reid had
seen. Reid's toughest opponent going into the Trinidad fight was a
fading Keith Mullings.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Ghanan is a fine all-around fighter. He has a
terrific jab, he can punch and he can box. If there was doubt, he
proved against De La Hoya that he could compete with anyone. His
performance was better than Trinidad's against De La Hoya, who
frustrated the Puerto Rican with his boxing skills until he gave
the fight away in the final rounds.
</P>
<P>
   However, he probably won't be Trinidad's equal when he steps
into the ring with Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad's inability to cope with a quick, exceptional boxer was
exposed by De La Hoya. Meanwhile, Quartey, who tends to fade late
in fights, was almost knocked out by De La Hoya in the 12th round
and had big problems against Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   If Lopez can get to Quartey, one must suspect Vargas could do
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Quartey has had another long layoff. He will not have
fought since the De La Hoya bout in February of last year - 14
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey and Vargas both said the layoff should be no factor.
After all, he did almost beat De La Hoya after another long layoff,
that one 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   However, logic says one fight in 2 years makes for a rusty
fighter. Quartey couldn't possibly be at his best on April 15,
which could leave a door open for Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit the nail on the head,'' said Vargas, when asked
whether he had anything to prove in this fight. ``Every time I
fight an experienced guy, people say I need more experience and
then I beat these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``By beating Ike Quartey, I will move up in the pound-for-pound
(best fighter) class, I'll show I don't need to have 20, 30, 40
fight to beat these guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe then I'll get respect, maybe people will say I'm a good
fight, a great fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   More Vargas: Vargas and Co. don't want to look past Quartey,
which is typical.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they're already negotiating to fight Trinidad
if Vargas wins.
</P>
<P>
   A victory over Quartey would give Vargas' career a meaningful
boost. A victory over Trinidad would catapult him to the top of the
sport, at least close to the level De La Hoya and Roy Jones have
reached.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Vargas-Trinidad is as fascinating as any
possible matchup.
</P>
<P>
   One more Vargas: ``KO'' magazine asks four former or current
fighters to predict the winner of the Vargas-Quartey fight in its
May issue.
</P>
<P>
   Genaro Hernandez, Bernard Hopkins and James Page pick Vargas
while, interestingly, Wright picks Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   More Quartey: AthletesDirect is auctioning on eBay an
opportunity to be part of Quartey's entourage for the April 15
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The winner gets: air fare, hotel, tickets, clearance to hang out
with Quartey before and after the fight and more.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the bidding has surpassed $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what that figure would be if it were De La Hoya....
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Vitali Klitschko, the previously undefeated
heavyweight, quit against substitute Chris Byrd to lose his WBO
title Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   No great surprise there. How many top European heavyweights have
turned out to be more hype than substance?...
</P>
<P>
   Fabrice Tiozzo defends his WBA cruiserweight title against
Valery Vikhor on Saturday in Paris on Showtime....
</P>
<P>
   Jose Navarro of Los Angeles beat a familiar foe at the Americas'
Qualifying Tournament in Tampa to earn a berth in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   He outpointed reigning U.S. champ Roberto Benitez, who failed to
make the U.S. team in the trials and was subsequently invited to
box for the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez's parents are Dominican....
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight Andrew Golota is scheduled to face Marcus Rhode on
April 22 in Guangzhou, China.
</P>
<P>
   Iran Barkely and Montell Griffin are among others scheduled to
fight on the card....
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Richard Hall has little chance to beat light
heavyweight champ Roy Jones on May 13 in Indianapolis. Hall hasn't
fought since June of last year and has yet to beat a big-name
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has a nice record: 24-1, with 23 knockouts. At least
there's !ital!some!off! intrigue....

ANGELS SHOWING NEW OPTIMISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With the Anaheim Angels, nothing is
predictable. Otherwise, how could their recent success against the
New York Yankees be explained?
</P>
<P>
   The Angels open the 2000 season against the defending champions
at 7:35 tonight at Edison Field with renewed optimism. But it has
nothing to do with the fact the Angels have won the season series
vs. the Yankees the past two seasons and four of the past five.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman improved the club with a
couple of trades with only a week remaining in spring training. The
popular and talented Jim Edmonds is gone, but the Angels have a
starting second baseman in Adam Kennedy and a starting pitcher in
Kent Bottenfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes patience has its rewards,'' Stoneman said. ``I think
it has paid to be patient because now we have two players our
people really like at positions (where) we had a need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally when I arrived in November we targeted starting
pitching. The road between then and now, you realize you just don't
get starting pitching. Everybody's looking for it. It's so
difficult to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman also made the move to acquire the young and talented
Edgard Clemente, who will DH and play the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the Angels, whom many have picked to finish last
in the competitive A.L. West, are excited about the season is the
attitude new manager Mike Scioscia and his coaching staff have
instilled in the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's experienced, he's won, he's played with some great
players,'' Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn said. ``He played a lot
of years. He puts the club together with expectations to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill will start for the Angels tonight against Orlando
Hernandez. Hill, called by Scioscia the ``ace'' of the staff, was
named the opening-night starter early in camp. Scioscia never
wavered in his praise of Hill during spring training, despite
Hill's inconsistent numbers (1-2, 7.94 ERA in six starts).
</P>
<P>
   And going up against the Yankees to start the season has no
added meaning, Scioscia says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had the philosophy of worrying about your own
house and not who you're playing, especially at the beginning of
the year,'' Scioscia said. ``Playing the Yankees won't have any
bearing on how we're going to attack it. Obviously the Yankees
bring to the table some things other teams don't, but you have to
attack it as if you're playing anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one final reason for optimism in Anaheim - health. At
this point last season, the Angels had already lost shortstop Gary
DiSarcina and Edmonds to injuries and were about to lose Vaughn in
the first inning of opening night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're starting the season on a roll,'' Scioscia said.
``We've played well, particularly the last 10 days or so. Another
thing I'm happy about is the club has practiced hard all spring and
is in great shape. I think we'll carry that over into the season.
I'm happy with the makeup of the club, the focus this club has.''

NORTHRIDGE SOFTBALL TEAM FINDS WINNING FORMULA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No worries.
</P>
<P>
   That was the mantra for Cal State Northridge softball players as
they went through a brutal February and March schedule. The
Matadors played nine teams in the USA Today/NFCA Coaches Top 25,
and were 3-11-1 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are one of the hottest teams on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN improved to 8-1 in the Big West Conference with a
three-game sweep of Sacramento State this weekend in Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played all those tough teams, and we worked through all
those growing pains,'' said CSUN coach Janet Sherman. ``It's just
taken time (for the team) to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge entered the Sac State series last in the Big West in
team batting average (.183) but it outscored the Hornets 23-4 over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors had 11 hits in Sunday's 9-0 win, which was stopped
after 4 innings because of the mercy rule. It's the first time CSUN
has won by a mercy rule this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem relaxed,we're having fun,'' said junior pitcher Sarah
Farnworth, who beat the Hornets twice this weekend, in addition to
having a save on Saturday. ``We had the talent, we just needed to
come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said she and assistants Barbara Jordan and Randy Roeder
worked on keeping the players from getting low after a a 2-6
stretch two weeks ago. Farnworth said there haven't been any
``clear-the-air'' players-only meetings this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to make each other press,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN has three nationally ranked teams left on the schedule: No.
2 Arizona, No. 17 Long Beach State and No. 12 Cal State Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors play host to Long Beach State (April 15-16) but
have to go to Fullerton the next weekend. LBSU and Fullerton are
both ahead of CSUN in the Big West standings.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman has taken the Matadors to the NCAA playoffs in each of
her first five seasons. CSUN was ranked 10th in the Pacific Region
in the latest regional rankings and it will move past No. 9 Sac
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every series is a big series for us right now,'' said Sherman,
who got her 200th coaching victory on March 18 against Fresno
State.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the faith: Even as CSUN's youthful baseball team
struggles - the Matadors dropped to 12-21 with two losses this
weekend at Oklahoma State - coach Mike Batesole said last week he
was encouraged by the team's good morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed,'' he said. ``Usually this is the time of the
season where fingers are being pointed and guys are going their
separate ways and forming groups. I'm not seeing any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge has only six homes games left, including UCLA on
April 15 and Cal State Fullerton in the finale on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Motley's marks: Triple-jumper Clinte Motley broke the broke the
school record Saturday in a nonconference quadrangular meet at
UCLA. Motley, a junior from Alta Loma High, went 52 feet, 7 inches,
breaking the mark of 52-6 set by John Haynes in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Motley, who set CSUN indoor records in February in the triple
jump (52-9) and high jump (7-3), also finished second Saturday in
the long jump with a mark of 22-9.
</P>
<P>
   Motley helped the men finish second to UCLA, 203-133, in
quadrangular scoring.
</P>
<P>
   The CSUN women, who also finished second to the host Bruins,
162-103, had four individual event winners: Annetta Wells in the
200 (24.11 seconds), Nancy James in the 800 (2:09.16), Nancy Dollar
in the 3,000 (9:55.9) and Dee Scott in the long jump (19-5).
</P>
<P>
   Foreign flavor: The Northridge women's tennis team has won 10 of
its last 13 matches, including an 8-1 win over Idaho State Saturday
at home.
</P>
<P>

JAPAN PREMIER SUFFERS STROKE; STAND-IN NAMED
</HEADLINE>
 (CORRECTS ``diagnosed as'' to ``attributed to'' in 6th graf  
(rk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The prime minister of Japan, Keizo Obuchi, has suffered
a stroke and was temporarily relieved of his duties Monday, the
government announced.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's condition was confirmed more than 24 hours after he was
hospitalized early Sunday, complaining of exhaustion. The prime
minister was temporarily replaced as the nation's top official by
Mikio Aoki, his chief Cabinet secretary, at a hastily convened news
conference early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 9:00 a.m. today, I accepted the job of acting prime
minister in accordance with the 9th article of cabinet law,'' Aoki
said. ``When I visited Mr. Obuchi yesterday, he said that pending
the results of his medical examination that I should take over the
job of acting prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Aoki said the move was especially justified by the emergency
operations surrounding the eruption four days ago of a volcano in
the country's northernmost province, Hokkaido. Aoki said he would
convene his first Cabinet meeting later in the day, and the meeting
was expected to be dominated by the government's response to the
eruption of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   The stroke suffered by Obuchi on Sunday comes at a time of
mounting political activity in Japan in anticipation of national
elections, which must be held by October. His incapacitation, even
if it proves only short--lived, injects a major dose of drama and
uncertainty to the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's medical emergency was initially attributed to
``overwork'' and came on a weekend when the prime minister was both
grappling with the emergency response in the north and struggling
to keep his ruling coalition together.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the leader of the smallest member of his three-party
coalition, the Liberal Party, announced its departure from the
government after an hourlong meeting with Obuchi. Less than an hour
later, Obuchi complained of extreme fatigue and asked shortly
afterward to be taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party leader, Ichiro Ozawa, expressed surprise and
regret Monday over Obuchi's condition. ``I was extremely surprised
at the information,'' he said. ``I would never have suspected that
he would be hospitalized after the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Obuchi entered  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  Juntendo
University Hospital around 1 a.m. on Sunday. For reasons that have
not yet been explained, the hos- pitalization was not announced to
the public until Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Even after such a long delay in announcing the medical
emergency, the government's initial statements about the prime
minister _ emphasizing that he had gone to the hospital in a
private vehicle and not an ambulance, and asserting that he had
never lost consciousness _ seemed mostly intended to minimize the
political impact of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has once previously experienced the temporary replacement
of a prime minister. Twenty years ago, Prime Minister Masayoshi
Ohira was also replaced by his chief Cabinet secretary. Ohira
eventually died in office, throwing the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party into turmoil on the eve of elections. He was ultimately
replaced by Masayoshi Ito.
</P>
<P>
   If Obuchi is incapacitated for any substantial length of time,
pressures will rise within his Liberal Democratic Party to chose a
new standard bearer before the October elections.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has been under increasing political pressure in recent
months, as the mandatory October deadline for new national
elections approaches and many economic indicators, as well as his
government's poll ratings, deteriorate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japanese political analysts say that Obuchi had hoped to call
elections after a summit meeting of the world's leading economic
powers, the Group of Eight, to be held in the southern prefecture
of Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has reportedly been working hard at ensuring
the success of the meeting, taking part in planning and other
preparations, and visiting the prefecture last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has a history of cardiac trouble, and uses a pacemaker to
stabilize his heartbeat. According to several Japanese newspapers,
Obuchi's history of heart problems had been discussed within his
party prior to his selection as its prime ministerial candidate.
Obuchi is reported to have collapsed once, in 1997, as a result of
his heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his hospitalization, Obuchi had been through an
unusually active weekend, closely monitoring the emergency
evacuation of an area near the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi and some predecessors have come under harsh criticism for
their tepid responses to past emergencies and natural disasters.
The government took several hours to respond to the country's worst
nuclear-related accident last September. And with elections due
soon, Obuchi's heavy involvement in the response to the volcanic
eruption seemed intended to avoid new criticism over the
government's ability to manage crises.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's government is by tradition extremely stingy with news
about the medical condition of officials and public figures. Other
than announcing the fact that Obuchi had suffered a stroke, the
government gave no information about its severity, or of Obuchi's
prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   The information vacuum sent the Japanese press into a
speculative frenzy, with many reporters seeking off-the-record
snippets of information from the medical staff at the hospital. On
that basis, the state broadcaster, NHK, announced shortly after
noon that Obuchi's condition was believed to be ``extremely
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why there had been such a lengthy delay before the
announcement of the prime minister's hospitalization, Aoki, who is
also the chief government spokesman, gave a somewhat
strained-sounding explanation. ``It was Sunday, and he was
undergoing examinations,'' he said. ``We were waiting to see how
things turned out. I had no other intention. I am speaking
honestly.''

HUSKIES ONE-UP VOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Delirious. That's probably an understatement for
describing how the University of Connecticut women's basketball
team felt Sunday &UR;  &LR; night as it led the entire way in routing the
Tennessee Lady Vols, 71-52, to win the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   The players on the bench ran onto the court, assistant coaches
broke down in tears, and head coach Geno Auriemma hugged his kids
and mother as the 20,060 fans at the First Union Center roared.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second title for the Huskies (36-1) _ their first
since 1995 _ as they defended the No. 1 spot they've held all
season. And it was a defiant defense that led the way. The teams
had split two games during the season and were 5-5 all-time.
</P>
<P>
   But the rivalry that had been touted all week _ all year, really
_ never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we came out and played, I'm not surprised,'' Auriemma
said. ``We wanted to prove that we're the best team in the country.
And when you do it against a team that's as good as and with as
much tradition as Tennessee, that makes it even more worthwhile.'
</P>
<P>
   With three minutes to go, Auriemma put in seniors Paige Sauer
and Stacy Hansmeyer, and then the rest of the reserves to finish
the job. The trophy was theirs.
</P>
<P>
   And even with his team ahead by 20 points, Auriemma didn't stop
yelling at his players or at the officials. This was, after all,
the final game of the season, so every possession mattered, every
foul counted, and every field goal made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   So what if guard Shea Ralph had three fouls before halftime? She
finished with a team-high 15 points, with six steals. Forward
Svetlana Abrosimova had 14 points, and Ashja Jones added 12. Center
Kelly Schumacher scored 6 points and had a career- and NCAA
tournament-high nine blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Pat Summitt was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an extremely disappointing game, and a very painful
loss, but in no way do I want this to take away from the way we
competed all year,'' she said. ``When you go up against a team as
aggressive and physical as Connecticut, you have to have great
guard play. But their defense, from beginning to end, pressured our
guards, and at times we played in a panic.'' The Lady Vols (33-4)
had 26 turnovers and made just 16 of 51 field goal attempts (31.4
percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this 26 years, and I never experienced what I
did today,'' Summitt said. ``We were shelled.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamika Catchings scored a team-high 16 points for the Lady Vols,
but her teammates were held to 8 points or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee had a letdown even before the tip. Starting guard
Kristen ``Ace'' Clement was knocked out of the lineup when she
suffered a right ankle sprain during the morning warmup.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, a junior from the Philadelphia area, had started in all
of Tennessee's games, averaging 5.6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma had said earlier in the NCAA tournament that he had a
theory _ players should look at the game in four- or five-minute
increments, and take it one quarter at a time.
</P>
<P>
   So it couldn't have looked better for him when the Huskies led,
9-4, at the 15:55 mark, and then went on a 10-2 run in the next
five minutes to lead, 19-6. The Lady Vols were limited to two field
goals by Michelle Snow and two free throws by Semeka Randall.
</P>
<P>
   Randall tried to rev up the Vols' crowd, but it didn't do any
good. Tennessee shot just 11 percent in the first 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee faced a double-digit deficit for most of the first
half, but came within 9, 28-19, with 1:33 to go on two free throws
by guard Kyra Elzy.
</P>
<P>
   But Swin Cash hit a running jump shot a minute later, and when
Sue Bird pulled up to hit a jump shot with five seconds left in the
half, the Huskies high-fived each other as they took a 32-19 lead
into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we played that good all year, and we got the
ultimate prize,'' said Ralph. She looked delirious.

WATCHING UCONN WAS POWERFUL EXPERIENCE

   PHILADELPHIA _ The only thing missing is the title transfer.
Maybe the NCAA can work on that this morning. The organization can
draft a blue-and-white document, stamp a Husky logo on it, add some
contractual words such as ``herewith'' and ``whereas,'' and make
official what everyone should know by now:
</P>
<P>
   The new college basketball queendom is based in Storrs, Conn. It
will be that way for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Connecticut Huskies defeated Tennessee in the
national championship game Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, 71-52. Well, that's not
entirely true. They didn't just defeat the Lady Volunteers. They
faced them at the First Union Center for 40 minutes and then took
over their dynastic rights at the end of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Like most takeovers, this one was abrupt. UConn and Tennessee
entered the game as the two best programs in America. Most of the
20,060 fans in the arena expected a gradual war. Instead, they
watched as Tennessee went on a 2-for-18 shooting odyssey to begin
the game. It was over in the first half. You could sense it. You
looked into the mass of orange-and-white on the Volunteer bench and
saw about 15 faces of confusion.
</P>
<P>
   These programs have met twice for the national title since 1995.
Twice, UConn has emerged as the champion. Tennessee may have six
titles under Pat Summitt, but you would be naive to think that
UConn 2, Tennessee 0 (head-to-head) won't come up again.
</P>
<P>
   UConn not only won a championship Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. The school
probably won a few more recruits, too. And that has to be
frightening to anyone who watched the game; why, you wondered,
would this team need anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   There were times when the game unfolded far too easily for the
skilled Huskies. Center Kelly Schumacher played 20 minutes and had
nine blocked shots. She blocked Tamika Catchings's shot, Semeka
Randall's shot, and Kara Lawson's shot. When she was on the court,
she made the Vols look for her. That was a problem for them since
they already were having problems looking at the rim (31-percent
shooting).
</P>
<P>
   When the young woman, who is nicknamed ``Schu,'' wasn't blocking
shots, guard Shea Ralph was, well, doing everything. She was
dominant with 15 points, 7 assists, and 6 steals. Because of her
work and the work of her teammates, there is now a new flag waving
above the College Hoops Capitol Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're young, we're not going away,'' Summitt said shortly
after her Rome-in-Knoxville had fallen. ``I'm not as old as Geno
thinks I am. We'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Summitt is right on many counts. She is 47 and UConn coach Geno
Auriemma is 46. The women from Tennessee will be back. But they
will be back as renters in the queendom they used to own. UConn won
the game by 19 points and, Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, they were at least 19
points better than the Vols. There was nothing anyone on the
Tennessee sideline could do to change that.
</P>
<P>
   It definitely wasn't the best day, karmawise, for the team from
Knoxville. Starting shooting guard Kristen ``Ace'' Clement sprained
her right ankle during a light morning practice and did not play.
Clement, a native of the Philadelphia area, was restricted to
cheering at the end of the bench. The cheers went from vigorous to
sporadic to nonexistent. Three minutes into the second half, the
score was already 40-19. Nineteen points for a Tennessee team? That
just doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup, Auriemma said he didn't want to share his
pregame thoughts. He explained that if he did, he would be
perceived as something that he doesn't want to be perceived as.
Said another way: People would think him arrogant if he said, ``I
knew we'd win,'' even if that was what he was truly thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The curator of the new New England dynasty, Auriemma is a
complex man who grew up in this city. He came to this country from
rural Italy when he was 7. He did not speak English when he
arrived. Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, he didn't need Italian or English when the
game ended. He was surrounded by his three children and all of them
stood together, crying. They tried to say a few words, but only
tears came. And then their grandmother, Auriemma's mother, headed
toward the court. Her son met her halfway and they embraced. More
tears.
</P>
<P>
   If you had watched those scenes, you might have shed a tear,
too. There was a feeling that something significant had happened.
Something had changed.
</P>
<P>
   This was a power swap. You can say New England is an area
obsessed with pro sports if you want. But you should know there is
now a dynasty in your back yard. It is tucked away in Connecticut,
in the queendom of Storrs.

ANGELS SHOWING NEW OPTIMISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixing byline)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With the Anaheim Angels, nothing is
predictable. Otherwise, how could their recent success against the
New York Yankees be explained?
</P>
<P>
   The Angels open the 2000 season against the defending champions
at 7:35 tonight at Edison Field with renewed optimism. But it has
nothing to do with the fact the Angels have won the season series
vs. the Yankees the past two seasons and four of the past five.
</P>
<P>
   Angels general manager Bill Stoneman improved the club with a
couple of trades with only a week remaining in spring training. The
popular and talented Jim Edmonds is gone, but the Angels have a
starting second baseman in Adam Kennedy and a starting pitcher in
Kent Bottenfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes patience has its rewards,'' Stoneman said. ``I think
it has paid to be patient because now we have two players our
people really like at positions (where) we had a need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally when I arrived in November we targeted starting
pitching. The road between then and now, you realize you just don't
get starting pitching. Everybody's looking for it. It's so
difficult to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman also made the move to acquire the young and talented
Edgard Clemente, who will DH and play the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the Angels, whom many have picked to finish last
in the competitive A.L. West, are excited about the season is the
attitude new manager Mike Scioscia and his coaching staff have
instilled in the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's experienced, he's won, he's played with some great
players,'' Angels first baseman Mo Vaughn said. ``He played a lot
of years. He puts the club together with expectations to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill will start for the Angels tonight against Orlando
Hernandez. Hill, called by Scioscia the ``ace'' of the staff, was
named the opening-night starter early in camp. Scioscia never
wavered in his praise of Hill during spring training, despite
Hill's inconsistent numbers (1-2, 7.94 ERA in six starts).
</P>
<P>
   And going up against the Yankees to start the season has no
added meaning, Scioscia says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had the philosophy of worrying about your own
house and not who you're playing, especially at the beginning of
the year,'' Scioscia said. ``Playing the Yankees won't have any
bearing on how we're going to attack it. Obviously the Yankees
bring to the table some things other teams don't, but you have to
attack it as if you're playing anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one final reason for optimism in Anaheim - health. At
this point last season, the Angels had already lost shortstop Gary
DiSarcina and Edmonds to injuries and were about to lose Vaughn in
the first inning of opening night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're starting the season on a roll,'' Scioscia said.
``We've played well, particularly the last 10 days or so. Another
thing I'm happy about is the club has practiced hard all spring and
is in great shape. I think we'll carry that over into the season.
I'm happy with the makeup of the club, the focus this club has.''

EDITORIAL: RETALIATING AGAINST SMITH &AMP; WESSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, April 3:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and gun dealers are foolishly
trying to punish Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gunmaker, for
striking a deal with the Clinton administration to embrace new
safety restrictions in exchange for ending threatened lawsuits
against the company. They are angry because Smith &AMP; Wesson, by
breaking ranks, has demolished the claim of gun-control opponents
that built-in trigger locks, better policing of gun dealers and
other safety measures would impose an impossible burden on the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has denounced Smith &AMP; Wesson for running up ``the white
flag of surrender,'' one of the nation's largest wholesalers said
it will stop distributing Smith &AMP; Wesson handguns, and many retail
dealers have said they will not sell Smith &AMP; Wesson products. The
gun industry denies any collusion to harm a competitor in violation
of antitrust laws, a matter that Eliot Spitzer, the attorney
general of New York, and Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney
general, are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   These retaliatory efforts add fresh urgency to the campaign to
get state and local governments to purchase their guns from Smith &AMP;
Wesson and other firms that adhere to the deal's principles. The
campaign is being led by Spitzer and Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo, two gun-control advocates who have been rivals for the
spotlight on this issue. This week, Sen. Charles Schumer, the New
York Democrat, will try to insert language in the federal budget
for federal law enforcement agencies to do the same. Spokesmen for
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki say their bosses are
generally supportive but need to study how they would implement the
preference. If the two men are serious, it should not be that hard
to find ways the city and state can use their purchasing power to
achieve stronger gun controls.

JUNIOR SET TO TAKE PLACE IN REDS' HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Joe Morgan remembers what it was like, when
Cincinnati was home to the Big Red Machine, the best team in
baseball and the greatest father-son game in history.
</P>
<P>
   When sharing a clubhouse with Pete Rose, Tony Perez and Ken
Griffey meant also sharing it with their kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all loved playing baseball,'' Morgan said. ``They used to
play it in the locker room. They were here early. When we came out
for batting practice they would come out to the cages, they would
go on the field. They were always around.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as much as ballplayers are on the road, it was good for
the fathers to have them around. Not many fathers are lucky enough
to be able to have their kids come to work with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for most kids, visiting the old man's workplace
involves sitting bored in a cubicle, keeping quiet and watching the
clock. It doesn't involve hanging around with future Hall of
Famers. Morgan said the Reds kids would imitate his batting stance,
flapping their left elbows just as he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the kids around here did that, though,'' Morgan said with
a smile. ``All the Little Leaguers did that in Cincinnati. And
within a month, I think you'll see them all imitating Junior's
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. Junior. After 11 summers in Seattle, after the biggest
trade of the winter, Ken Griffey Jr. opens his first season with
the team he dreamed about playing for when he was a kid in the
Cincinnati clubhouse. Game time for Monday's Reds-Brewers opener at
Cinergy Field is 10 a.m. PDT, barring rain (there were showers
throughout Sunday and more forecast for Monday).
</P>
<P>
   While the other Reds were more than willing to discuss the
opener, the season and their new teammate, Griffey declined to
speak much more than a sentence or two to reporters, refusing to
take part in an interview session until after Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   He did tell a handful of reporters that he enjoyed opening day
as a child in Cincinnati because he could skip school to go to the
game. ``My son is skipping school on opening day. It's a
tradition,'' he said. ``Cincinnati expects that a lot of kids
aren't going to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Griffey went about his business quietly Sunday. He
unpacked an enormous container filled with uniform pants, running
shorts, batting gloves, shoes and T-shirts. He tried on his Reds
uniform and pronounced it properly tailored. He tossed aside two
pairs of running pants with the Mariners' colors _ ``Won't be
needing those.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a passing of the torch of sorts, Johnny Bench brought his
son into the clubhouse to meet Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You listen to every age group,'' Bench said, ``from first
graders on up to 90-year-old men in nursing homes and it's all the
same. Do they have enough pitching? And, how many home runs will
Griffey hit?''
</P>
<P>
   This is a city that takes its baseball and its team seriously
enough that it still gets a little miffed when another team dares
to open the season before the Reds. A city that has a street named
for Rose, even though he did time for cheating on taxes and is
banned from baseball for betting on the game.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Griffey Avenue yet, though a downtown store is
selling Griffey Jr. street signs along with the Pete Rose Way
signs.
</P>
<P>
   How excited is the city? Said Reds chief operating officer John
Allen, ``I've gotten three standing ovations when I've gone out to
Rotary luncheons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the fans I've talked to, there must have been 10,000
kids where Junior went to high school. They all say, `I went to
high school with him.' It sounds like everyone in Cincinnati went
to high school with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati first baseman Sean Casey learned his thumb was broken
and he would miss the season's first two weeks but he was genuinely
excited about the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``The craze will be awesome,'' he said. ``It will be exciting
just to hear him introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   And what will it be like when he's introduced?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the Messiah,'' Bench said. ``You know how Cincinnati
feels about their hometown boys, from Pete to Barry Larkin to
Junior _ and they'll think this is absolutely the best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be electric,'' Allen said. ``I think
there will be two instances. First, when the players run on the
field for their introductions and then when they say, ``Playing
center field, number 24 ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Whoops. Make that No. 30. Griffey has switched from his familiar
24 to his father's old Reds number (Senior is wearing 33).
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's going to take some getting used to, seeing Griffey in
a uniform other than one of Seattle's three dozen day-alternate
business person's holiday jerseys. But there's time. An entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the fantastic plays and the dramatic home runs,'' Larkin
said, ``all start tomorrow.''

EDITORIAL: JUSTICE FOR THE KHMER ROUGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, April 3:
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades after the mass slaughter in Cambodia, a
critical moment is at hand in a long-overdue attempt to bring the
killers to justice. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will soon
decide whether the U.N. should participate in a criminal court that
will try surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge, whose members killed
more than a million Cambodians between 1975 and 1979. The court
will be in Cambodia and needs the approval of Cambodia's strongman,
Hun Sen, who is doing all he can to impose conditions that would
enable him to manipulate the trials. Annan must make clear that the
U.N. will not abide by those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A team of U.N. negotiators left Cambodia last month after
failing to reach agreement with the government on ground rules for
the tribunal. But progress was made and the negotiations are not
over. Annan is expected to take up the matter directly with Hun Sen
at a meeting of developing nations in Cuba later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Some form of international participation will be essential to
real justice. The Cambodian judicial system has neither the
competence nor the political independence to conduct credible
trials on its own. The best approach would be an international
tribunal like those the U.N. established for Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia, but Hun Sen rejected the idea. Until last month
discussions on U.N. support for Cambodian trials had made little
progress since the surrender in 1999 of the last fugitive Khmer
Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point involves a legitimate demand by the U.N.
that the tribunal include a foreign prosecutor with independent
authority to issue indictments. The Cambodians have insisted on
having co-prosecutors, one foreign and one Cambodian, in a
collaborative arrangement that would effectively give Hun Sen veto
power over any indictment. This would be unacceptable. The U.N.
must not participate in a process that fails to grant an
independent prosecutor sufficient authority to issue indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998, but many of his top
lieutenants are alive and free in Cambodia. Hun Sen cut deals that
effectively gave some of the top surviving Khmer Rouge leaders _
Ieng Sary, Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan _ immunity from prosecution
in exchange for their loyalty. But their immunity should not apply
to an internationally backed tribunal, and the U.N. must insist
that these men be tried. Without them the process will be a
mockery.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, April 3:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys general and consumer advocates increasingly have
expressed alarm over abusive practices in the ``subprime'' home
equity market, which caters to people with blemished credit records
and charges them higher interest rates and fees. Practices like
tacking exorbitant fees onto loans without adequate disclosure can
cause unsuspecting consumers to borrow more than they can repay,
driving them into default and resulting in the loss of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a New York-based home loan company, Delta Financial,
settled a lawsuit filed by three federal agencies accusing it of
predatory lending to minority homeowners. Earlier, Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, gave added prominence to the
issue by voicing his concern about such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan indicated that the Federal Reserve is working with
several federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission,
the justice department and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, to examine deceptive behavior in this market. Other
agencies, individual states and some in Congress are also pressing
for a crackdown. The subprime lenders are largely regulated by the
states, whose laws can vary substantially.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the chief pressure on lenders has come from
private consumer lawsuits. Last month, the First Alliance Corp., a
prominent subprime lender that is facing lawsuits by several
homeowners and the AARP for deceptive practices, filed for
bankruptcy protection. First Alliance, the subject of a report by
The Times' Diana Henriques and ABC News, denies the accusations.
The bankruptcy proceeding will freeze the legal actions and force
the plaintiffs to pursue their claims in bankruptcy court. First
Alliance is also facing suits by regulators in Illinois and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing will give no relief to customers of First
Alliance who face high repayments. But the troubled lender says it
will stop making new loans. Meanwhile, federal regulators need to
examine the adequacy of state regulations and intensify federal
oversight in this market.

</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, April 3:
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin has made clear that he intends to maintain
Russia's nuclear defenses. But he also faces sharp reductions in
the number of long-range nuclear weapons capable of reaching the
United States. His election as president should revive stalled arms
negotiations between Washington and Moscow. Completing a treaty
that would lock in deep new weapons cuts by the time President
Clinton leaves office is a realistic target. A new agreement should
also incorporate changes in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty
that would allow both countries to deploy limited defensive systems
to protect against threats from rogue states like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still has a little more than nine months left to work
with Putin toward this mutually beneficial goal. History shows that
American presidents can deal effectively with arms control issues
until their final weeks in office. The last major nuclear arms
reduction treaty with Russia was signed by President Bush on Jan.
3, 1993, less than three weeks before he turned over the White
House to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ratification of that treaty got caught up in the
parliamentary gridlock in Moscow. Getting it approved by the newly
elected parliament should be one of Putin's earliest goals.
Carrying out the 1993 treaty would cut the number of long-range
nuclear warheads on both sides almost in half from the current
levels of about 6,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that pending treaty is ratified, intensive
negotiations should begin on a new treaty that would bring those
numbers down to around 2,000 or even lower. Without these further
cuts, Russia would have to build thousands of new single-warhead
missiles to replace the multiwarhead missiles it must destroy under
the 1993 treaty. Building expensive new missiles that both sides
already agree should be negotiated away would be a wasteful use of
Russia's pinched budgetary resources.
</P>
<P>
   The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is an integral part of
the arms-control architecture Washington has developed with Moscow.
Defense planners on both sides have felt comfortable with lower
levels of offensive missiles knowing that they would not have to
penetrate a defensive missile shield. But the ABM treaty was
negotiated at a time when this kind of missile calculus was
premised on a clash between the two superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   The likely emergence of smaller, less-predictable nuclear-armed
nations over the next few years creates a different equation.
Neither America nor Russia wants to be blackmailed by countries
like North Korea threatening to unleash a handful of poorly aimed
but highly destructive nuclear missiles. The technology of limited
defensive missile shields has not yet been reliably perfected. But
when it is, both countries should be free, within carefully
negotiated limits, to protect their people from this kind of
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who has not yet made his mark on the world stage, and
Clinton, whose two terms in office have not brought a major arms
control success, have before them a clear opportunity. They can
eliminate thousands of unneeded nuclear weapons and help free their
countries from one of the Cold War's most dangerous legacies.  &QL;

SAD DISCOURSE OF MESA HAS FAMILIAR RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Wearing a scowl that at least made him look like a
closer, Jose Mesa walked out of Lou Piniella's office Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This was about an hour before game time at Safeco Field, where
the M's played their final exhibition of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Since Piniella already announced that Mesa is not the Mariners'
closer _ remember, last week, Mesa gave up six runs on six hits to
six unknown Padres minor leaguers, ouch _ it's tough to know what
was left to say to Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Piniella wanted to warn Mesa not to be jealous. In a city
where dog owners have been known to name their pets after Mariner
stars like Griffey and Buhner, a new crop of canines might carry
the tag: ``Kazuhiro.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Mariners' opener tomorrow, and after the bitter taste
of Mesa's blown save in last July's Safeco opener, the stage is set
for the very self-possessed all-time save leader from Japan,
Kazuhiro Sasaki, to restore order to the Mariners bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   On a Mariners team built on pitching, Sasaki _ known as
``Diamajin,'' Japanese for ``malevolent deity'' _ is the only
pitcher who exceeded expectations during spring training, earning
him respect and the closer role.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mesa, perhaps this is a generous way of pardoning his
declining skills, but it is not his fault the Mariners signed him
to a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it his fault that the Mariners, desperate, set up
expectations that in the wake of Bobby Ayala and a rapidly
declining Norm Charlton, Mesa would be the man.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, signing Mesa last season was a high-risk proposition _
one that has set Mesa up to be the whipping boy not only of
Piniella but of Mariners baseball fans who can't fathom why Mesa is
so unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball parlance, Mesa has lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland knew it was time to cut Mesa loose. He was never the
same after he blew the save in the 1997 World Series that cost
Cleveland the championship to the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Mariners ignored the fact that Mesa was toast in
Cleveland and later again in San Francisco, where he walked in runs
and was seen to be beyond restoration.
</P>
<P>
   But for the M's, desperation led to a desperate move, even
though the speed gun does not lie.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa's fastball never gets much above 93 or 94 mph. He's got
nothing else in his arsenal to make the hitters bite. His 33 saves
last season were really, at best, 10 saves and here he was in
Arizona last week, enduring more jeers and boos as his career
further unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   By now, you could say Mesa is used to his status as one of
baseball's unloved performers. But you can not envy his station in
life. Some of us would not trade the $3 million he'll make this
season to have to suffer the merciless public failures.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, Seattle sports fans this past week have been
taking a hard look at Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, time has come to trash-talk Baker's
soft-as-a-down-pillow game.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the Sonics so-called power forward reached a
crescendo last Thursday when, after a five-game home losing streak,
Baker's tendency to float from the paint to the perimeter and avoid
the nasty stuff was deemed a major reason why the Sonics were
losing.
</P>
<P>
   To magnify matters, word is that Baker resorted to pouting last
Friday after Sonics coach Paul Westphal, along with Gary Payton and
Horace Grant, challenged Baker to do the dirty work required of his
position.
</P>
<P>
   As in the case of Mesa, however, you have to ask:
</P>
<P>
   Is it Baker's fault the Sonics signed him to a seven-year deal
for $87 million, which is the NBA maximum salary?
</P>
<P>
   It's like that song, ``Looking for love in all the wrong
places.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's went with Mesa because there wasn't anyone else out
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, meanwhile, re-signed Baker not because they were
convinced he could get the job done, but because they did not want
to take the risk of losing the free agent and finding themselves
handcuffed by salary cap restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sonics, who watched Baker's alarming display of poor
conditioning and depression-like response to poor play, making
Baker one of their high-paid centerpiece players was as much a wing
and a prayer and a guarantee for wins.
</P>
<P>
   He's still young. He appears to have the basketball tools. He
has been an All-Star. All these things roll up into a risky hope
that Baker will turn himself into the star the Sonics need _ and we
repeat, need _ him to be.
</P>
<P>
   But basketball fans in Seattle can't quite wrap their minds
around a team, a league and sports phenomenon that prompts a
franchise to reward a guy like Baker for such serious
underachievement.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, it is hard to know exactly what Baker thinks about
himself, his game, his role on the Sonics and in the NBA. Yes, he
might have the physical tools. But Baker gives every appearance of
being a very nice guy. He is soft spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Baker might think that if the Sonics brought Grant in to do the
heavy lifting, how come he doesn't have the right to float out and
look for his jumper, the way Payton looks to create his own shots
instead of passing first, especially late in the game?
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, he might believe he is playing as hard as he can. He
might think that running and sweating and wanting his minutes
proves his desire.
</P>
<P>
   It is Baker's misfortune, though, that his desire will
ultimately be judged by everyone else. Same with Mesa, whose arm
doesn't deliver the kind of stuff fans want to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the big time.

SPARTANS, GATORS GEARED FOR UP-AND-DOWN TITLE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Get out your running shoes and prepare for one
final sprint to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   But keep a cooler by the couch: There won't be any time for
dashes to the fridge Monday night, not with Michigan State and
Florida dueling in a track meet that figures to be a nonstop battle
for the college basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans show up at the RCA Dome as survivors of a Saturday
slugfest with Wisconsin, eager to flow in the open court and win
the national title, just like point guard Mateen Cleaves said they
would.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators appear as the polished challenger, whipping North
Carolina in the other semifinal, preparing to unleash another
baseline-to-baseline attack with a talented, deep rotation.
</P>
<P>
   All of the keys were discussed Sunday, many dealing with
Florida's ability to create opportunities and fatigue with its
relentless full-court defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a controlled chaos,'' said Gators guard Brett Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Spartans were pressed by reporters who wondered if
Tom Izzo's team can cope with those athletic and frenetic
Floridians for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally the answer was yes; Cleaves is a superb ball-handler
and his teammates are equally experienced, not apt to be flustered.
In fact, Michigan State doesn't want to settle for simply breaking
the press, preferring to capitalize by pushing the ball and getting
2-on-1 situations.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, though, believes it messes with people's heads. The
Gators see the mental distraction and physical exhaustion in their
victims' body language.
</P>
<P>
   In Gainesville, it's called Billy Ball, a system devised by
Billy Donovan, a 34-year-old who looks like he would be
emasculating someone in the corporate world if he wasn't coaching a
successful basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's Gators are as slick as he is. Even if it appears that
Florida consists of a bunch of free-wheelers, the concepts are
sound, debunking perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our style of play is completely misunderstood,'' Donovan said.
``All we're doing is trying to get easy baskets in transition. We
do things that are maybe a little bit unconventional, but we've
still got to rebound, play unselfishly and screen and execute.
We're doing all of the fundamental aspects, we're just doing them
at a faster rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's strength is its depth. Ten players contribute. None
played more than 29 minutes against the Tar Heels. In addition to
the freshness factor that reveals itself in the second half,
Florida's reserves routinely batter the opposition, the Gators'
bullpen outscoring North Carolina's 37-2.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has quite the collection of standouts, which enables the
Gators to overcome off-shooting nights like the ones Mike Miller
and Teddy Dupay had against North Carolina, going a combined
4-for-21.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the freshman who is supposed to be the best player from
West Virginia since Jerry West, compensated with 13 points. And
Florida, more frequently viewed as a perimeter outfit, also has
players like Udonis Haslem, Donnell Harvey, Brent Wright and Matt
Bonner who inflict considerable damage inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Udonis is as good as any frontcourt player in America,''
Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's journey to the title game nearly ended at its first
stop in Winston-Salem, where it defeated Butler 69-68 in overtime
on Miller's last-second shot from the lane. Since then, the Gators
have flattened their NCAA Tournament opponents by an average of
12.5 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering what inspired Florida, you could say that
Butler did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game gave our guys a tremendous sense of energy and
emotion of understanding how fragile this whole thing is and how
you can be sitting home at the blink of an eye,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Kenyan Weaks, Florida's only senior: ``That game brought
us together. The season could have been over, but we realized we
had each other's backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some come from the inner city, some from the suburbs, others
from the sticks, like Miller, a native of Mitchell, S.D. Their
universal will to win overrides any cultural differences.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Donovan molds and motivates. He showed them the
movie ``Rudy'' and tapes of the Muhammad Ali-George Foreman
rope-a-dope fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put those situations in front of our guys so they can see
what a hunger, what a passion, what a desire does for a human being
when they want something,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach wasn't sure what he planned to show to last night, but
Dupay had an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll see `Home Alone,' '' he said. ``Some young kid
defending his house.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning for its second consecutive Final Four, Michigan State
lost to Duke in the semifinals last year, after which Cleaves vowed
to win the national title this season. The scenario for a sequel
with a better ending is set.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans are confident and concerned. They're aware of the
Gators' firepower and understand that their own bench will have to
be more productive. They know they can't go 12 minutes without a
field goal like they did against Wisconsin. But Michigan State,
with three seniors and two juniors in the starting lineup, believes
it has the veterans to withstand the assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the fortitude. Morris Peterson, the Spartans'
leading scorer, and Cleaves could have left a year early to sample
life in the NBA but chose to stay in East Lansing for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, particularly, epitomizes Izzo's motto of ``players
play, and tough players win.'' Cleaves may be erratic with his
shooting, but the body and mind are solid. He leads in different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys you have to yell at, others you have to help them
laugh to ease their tensions,'' Cleaves said. ``And then there are
others you just have to stare at to get their attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night in the RCA Dome, he will focus on a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's ever a guy who had a true dream, it's Mateen,''
Izzo said. ``He's dreamed it since he was old enough to touch a
basketball, and he has the opportunity. We're going to find out if
it can become reality.''

MARINERS DEMOTE TOMKO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There are aproximately zero major league teams for
whom the final cutdown day is not without pain and angst, and so it
was for Seattle Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko, a hard thrower who came to the club from Cincinnati
in the Ken Griffey Jr. trade of Feb. 10, was judged to be too
limited by lack of innings thrown and was one of four players sent
to the minor leagues as the Mariners got down to the 25-player
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tomko declined to talk about the move with the media,
it was clear he was furious.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he was the Opening Day starting pitcher for the Reds
in a season that would wind up one game short of the post-season.
Today, he's just another veteran minor leaguer struggling to get
back to the bigs.
</P>
<P>
   Sent via option to Triple-A Tacoma in addition to Tomko were
right-handed pitcher Kevin Hodges and infielder Carlos Hernandez.
Right-handed pitcher Todd Williams was outrighted to the Rainiers.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the Seattle roster is major. Gil Meche claims the
final spot in the rotation. And outfielder/infielder Charles Gipson
and outfielder/catcher Raul Ibanez, both of whom could have been
bumped from the roster had Tomko stuck as a 12th pitcher, will
start the season with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision, but he and we are better served,''
Piniella said, referring to Tomko. ``He can start the season
pitching in a rotation, building up his arm strength and his
velocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be difficult to have Meche and Tomko in the
rotation, and to have one in the rotation and one in the bullpen
would have set the one in the bullpen back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomko was judged by the Mariners not to be ready after a left
Achilles tendon problem he brought to spring training slowed him
down. He only threw four innings in his final spring appearance on
Friday in Las Vegas, two innings less than the Mariners wanted from
him.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Meche, who lost a week of spring training due
to a sore lat muscle behind his right shoulder, pitched only 82/3
innings in Cactus League games, five innings less than Tomko.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Saturday night, the option of carrying 12 pitchers on
a roster that would have included both Meche, who did pitch in
minor league spring games, and Tomko was alive, even likely.
</P>
<P>
   But that would have meant the Mariners would have had to start
the season without Gipson, leaving them short on middle infield
help.
</P>
<P>
   Or they would have had to risk losing Ibanez on waivers, because
the outfielder is out of options. Moving Tomko then became the
simplest, least disruptive way to balance out the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Tomko will join Tacoma's rotation and could be back in Seattle
soon. Or come back not at all.
</P>
<P>
   If he thrives at Tacoma and stretches out to pitch six or seven
innings effectively, he could be brought back to Seattle if one of
the five starters _ Meche, Jamie Moyer, Freddy Garcia, Aaron Sele
and John Halama _ falters or is hurt.
</P>
<P>
   If none of those five is hurt or stumbling, however, the
likelihood is that Tomko would be traded, if he's pitching well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know he's a major league pitcher,'' Piniella said. ``He
wasn't very happy when he was told, and I concur with that. But
what he has to do is take it as a positive that he is liked here
but is being sent down as a consequence of needing more innings to
get in shape to throw six or seven innings (per start).
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel he's very important to our pitching staff. Just not
right at this time.''

SONICS CAN'T SOLVE BLAZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ It would stand to reason that the Portland
Trail Blazers might be more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Their starting center was unavailable because of an injury, and
his replacement became disqualified, barely lasting two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sonics were the ones a bit off kilter Sunday night
in a 95-82 loss in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   What they missed most were shots. Even the freebies wouldn't
fall, an untimely deficiency that led to the Sonics losing for the
fourth time in as many meetings with the Blazers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard. We just didn't play well,'' said Sonics coach
Paul Westphal, who watched his team shoot 40 percent and miss 12 of
26 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics remained in eighth place in the Western Conference
standings. They fell 1{ games behind the seventh-seeded Sacramento
Kings, who beat Philadelphia yesterday at home.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second straight game when those `e' words _ effort
and energy _ weren't called into question for the Sonics. It seemed
evident that the momentum from an emotional win against Sacramento
last Friday carried over into the first half of this game.
</P>
<P>
   Exploitation, though, became a troubling term for the Sonics in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Portland used its deep lineup to overcome poor shooting (41
percent), the absence of center Arvydas Sabonis (sprained right
foot) and Rasheed Wallace (ejected early in the second quarter).
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 67-63 with 10:47 left in the game, Portland found
favorable matchups with its reserves on the floor to extend the
lead. The Blazers got Stacey Augmon, Detlef Schrempf, Jermaine
O'Neal and, sometimes, Scottie Pippen in post-up situations over
the Sonics smaller guards.
</P>
<P>
   With each of those players standing 6-foot-8 or taller, the
Blazers literally became a big challenge down the stretch. On
several occasions, Sonics guard Vernon Maxwell found himself giving
up four inches in the post.
</P>
<P>
   Portland went on a 12-4 run and led 79-67 after Schrempf's
putback basket.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Sonics got within eight points in the final period.
But Portland closed the door on both comebacks by converting free
throws. The Blazers made all eight foul shots in the fourth and
finished the game 24-for-30 at the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portland always found the extra guy to exploit us,'' Westphal
said. ``They have size and quickness advantages and did a great job
of taking it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics battled until the Blazers countered with their size.
Seattle trailed just 45-43 at halftime and was in the game mainly
because of rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Patterson's eight rebounds in the first half helped the
Sonics forge a 29-21 edge on the boards. The Sonics collected 13
offensive rebounds at that point. Scoring easy baskets in
transition and cleaning up their misses is what kept the Sonics
close. But the Sonics did not rebound any of their shots in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played hard and we played well defensively,''
forward Vin Baker said. ``But the essence of the game is to make
shots. We didn't do that. Give Portland credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace started at center for Portland because Sabonis is on the
injured list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time we have been in that position,''
Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``But I was pleased the way we
responded. The key was ball movement.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the Blazers had been cut down to size even more when
Wallace was ejected with 10:37 left in the second period. Wallace
argued with referee Joe Crawford after a foul had been whistled on
teammate Brian Grant's putback attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace thought he had been hacked on his shot in the sequence.
He complained for about five seconds. Then, Crawford tagged Wallace
with two technical fouls and sent him to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   The game reached a feverish pitch at that point. On the Sonics
next trip up court, Jermaine O'Neal received a flagrant foul for a
hard hit on Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Baker split two free throws and then sank a short jumper in the
lane after the Sonics were awarded possession. That basket got the
Sonics within 23-22 with 10:04 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of opportunities in the first half to build a
lead, but we shot only 37 percent and had too many turnovers,''
Westphal said. ``When Portland found ways to make plays, our bad
shooting continued. ... Our missing 12 free throws was
catastrophic.''

 ``AMERICAN DREAMER: THE ART OF PHILIP C. CURTIS'' 
 Hudson Hills Press ($45) 
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering the longevity of Philip Curtis' distinguished career
as a painter, it is surprising that only now has the first
full-length book of the artist's work been published.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``American Dreamer: The Art of Philip C. Curtis,'' the
book is a rich coffee-table compendium of the artist's work, filled
out with a series of essays by art critics and historians about the
Scottsdale resident.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly worth the price for the reproductions, which
cover Curtis' career from 1937 to the present, beginning with the
early New York social paintings and abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   The essays are less of a gift. They offer the occasional
insight, but mainly they pad the volume with endless jargon and
obscurantist palaver. It is a tough read and you come out the back
end without feeling a sense of either enlightenment or enjoyment.
This is not a book of graceful prose.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is little to illuminate the life and
personality of Curtis, who is a wonderfully interesting man, with a
wry sense of wit that can cut through the BS like a scalpel. He
once told me, ``Yes, I'm happy, but not so happy that I'm an idiot
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been helpful to have at least one essay that would
serve as a biography or at least a snapshot of the man's
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, each essay dives headfirst into the list of ``isms''
and influences that make up an art historian's narrow worldview.
Several of the essays repeat the same information, almost word for
word, as if there had been no editor to keep track of the
redundancies and weed them out.
</P>
<P>
   And the verbiage reaches a climax in the essay by Susan Ehrlich,
``Invocations of Wonder Transfixed in Time,'' in which the author's
love of Roget outmans her and wrestles her to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis' work, she writes, ``bears filiations with the cryptic
illusions of Belgian Surrealists.''
</P>
<P>
   And she tells us ``suspense accrues from the enfilade of
sequestered rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   And a door ``leads to secluded recessions (that) can signify
psychological travel through shrouded corridors of the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   This stuff is thick.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on: ``Certainly Curtis over the years has juggled
antitheses, clothing complex issues in simple attire, treating
prosaic forms in a Surreal way, and imposing a rationcinative order
on ideation's fugitive wraiths.''
</P>
<P>
   The horror. The horror.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of these essays, we are given a tour of the alleged
influences on Curtis, and how you can spot Matisse here, or Helen
Lundeberg there, as if such observations meant anything.
</P>
<P>
   There is some relief in the longish final essay by Harry Rand.
It is not gracefully written, either, but it does offer some
insight into the sophistication of Curtis' mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even Rand can lob out a line like: ``He was not alone in
eschewing a reductionist telos of Abstract Expressionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a one of them seems to understand Curtis with the clarity of
``Time'' magazine founder Henry Luce, who once wrote that
``Curtis's people are clearly all `waiting for Godot.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He hits a simple truth of the art that all the righteous
scholarship of the art historians seems blind to in the verbal
blizzard of their glossolalia. &QL;

NEXTEL TO OFFER WIRELESS `WORLD PHONE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Targeting a market now served largely by Omnipoint and expensive
satellite phones, Nextel Communications is offering a new wireless
phone that can be used around most of the world with one phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   It's not cheap: The phone costs $350, or $250 under a launch
promotion. And calling prices range from $1 a minute in Western
Europe up to $5 in some African, Southeast Asian, and Eastern
European countries.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with the cost and hassle of using a calling card or
hotel room phone internationally, and considering the convenience
for US-based globetrotters to be able to take their phone around
the world and get calls wherever they are, ``It's a good move for
Nextel,'' said Adam Zawel, a wireless analyst with The Yankee Group
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   To use the service, subscribers must buy a Motorola i2000 phone.
It is a ``dual mode'' phone that works on Nextel's iDEN network
system in the United States and Latin America, and on the GSM
standard that dominates in Europe, Asia, and much of the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Omnipoint, one of the six carriers that serves Greater Boston,
uses the GSM standard and heavily promotes that you can take your
Omnipoint phone to Europe and get phone calls there as if you were
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   However, GSM service still has some big holes domestically.
Omnipoint phones cannot pick up service in some big cities,
including Chicago, Dallas, and New Orleans, although GSM networks
are being built out now.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel covers all but four of the 100 largest US metropolitan
markets and large cities in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and
Peru with iDEN service.
</P>
<P>
   While so-called third generation phones are in development that
would work on the multiple conflicting network systems in use
around the world, it could be two to three years before they hit
the market. That gives Nextel a window of opportunity for
international roaming.
</P>
<P>
   The Reston, Va.-based company is known for an operating system
that allows use of the phone as a walkie-talkie. The phones are
especially popular with tradespeople, fleet drivers, and service
technicians for big companies because their offices can make
``direct connect'' radio calls to them.
</P>
<P>
   To get international calling access, Nextel customers will have
to pay a $5 monthly fee in addition to their domestic calling plan.
But the charge will be permanently waived for people who sign up
before June 30, said Nextel executive vice president Tom Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Zawel said he thinks the price would make the average consumer
think twice. ``But with most Nextel customers, their company foots
the bill,'' so steep foreign roaming charges may not deter business
users, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   A Nextel-commissioned survey by pollsters Wirthlin Worldwide
found that the majority of US business travelers don't use cell
phones when they travel abroad. Nearly three-quarters use a hotel
phone, and 53 percent use a calling card at a payphone.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third said they repeatedly experience problems such
as not being able to find a phone or get a good connection.
</P>
<P>
   To make calls when abroad, subscribers to the Nextel service
would press and hold the 0 key to get international access, then
dial the number they are calling. In a country where the service
works, their phone would ring whenever someone called their
10-digit US phone number.

FAUST APPOINTED DEAN OF NEW RADCLIFFE INSTITUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Six months after Harvard University merged
with Radcliffe College, Harvard president Neil L. Rudenstine Sunday
named the first dean of the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study,
the pared-down legacy of the elite 106-year-old women's college.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine selected Drew Gilpin Faust, a history professor and
director of the women's studies program at the University of
Pennsylvania. The selection capped an eight-month search in which a
committee reviewed more than 80 applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faust has the clarity of mind, the commitment, and the
leadership qualities essential to the successful launching of this
new venture, particularly within an institution as complex as
Harvard,'' Rudenstine said.
</P>
<P>
   Faust, who turned down an offer to teach at Harvard in 1989,
will take over Radcliffe in January. With the decision still taking
root in her mind, she said at a news conference Sunday she has not
yet made specific plans for revamping Radcliffe. But, she said,
``It's not as if this is a blank slate. There are hints where to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   When she takes over the reins next year from acting dean Mary
Maples Dunn, she said, her focus would be to build on Radcliffe's
work in the field of women, gender, and society and deepen the
roots of the new fellowship program, which brings in distinguished
scholars, artists, and other professionals (both women and men) to
study any subject of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the mid-1970s that an agreement between the
schools allowed women to be jointly admitted to Harvard and
Radcliffe, which retained its independence. With the merger
agreement announced last April, however, Radcliffe ended its
undergraduate role, dissolved its board of trustees, and received a
$150 million investment from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Radcliffe Institute is considered on par with Harvard's
nine other institutions such as Harvard Law School and the John F.
Kennedy School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine said the appointment of Faust, a prolific author who
has written five books and specializes in Civil War studies,
grounds the new institution and will shape its uncharted future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deans at Harvard have enormous power,'' Faust said. ``As far
as I understand, that's how Harvard works: The dean decides and
sets the tone.''

AG TO ENFORCE STRICTER GUN SAFETY RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the gun industry finally admitting defeat,
Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly says he will begin to enforce the
state's tough weapon safety standards, which had been tied up in a
lengthy court battle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to
try to utilize consumer protection regulations to enforce handgun
safety. The rules were issued, but never implemented, by former
attorney general Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations effectively ban cheap ``Saturday night
specials'' and require all handguns sold in Massachusetts to
include childproof locks, tamperproof serial numbers, and safety
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   The rules also set strict safety standards for gun
manufacturers, and permit the attorney general's office to conduct
independent tests to ensure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   According to state law enforcement sources, Reilly's actions
affect not only Massachusetts gun dealers, but also gun
manufacturers across the country that must comply with the new
safety standard in order to sell weapons in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very bad news for the gun industry that's already
staggering from lawsuits and the recent Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement,''
said one state law enforcement official who declined to be
identified. ``It shows states can effectively adopt and enforce gun
safety standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The court battle over the regulations ended on March 20, when
the gun industry failed to meet the deadline for appealing a
Suffolk Superior Court decision upholding the attorney general's
authority to issue gun safety regulations. Reilly had been waiting
to ensure the gun industry had given up its legal battle before
embarking on the full-scale enforcement effort, slated to begin
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge victory,'' said John Rosenthal of Stop Handgun
Violence, a leading proponent of gun-control measures in the state.
``And since the attorneys general in 34 other states have similar
powers, we hope that in the absence of a national safety standard
for guns, this will become a blueprint for how states can regulate
the manufacture and sale of handguns.'
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., the nation's largest gun
manufacturer, voluntarily signed a code of conduct accepting
responsibility for how its guns are distributed and sold. The
Springfield, Mass. company was facing the threat of a costly
federal lawsuit when it agreed to sweeping safety measures intended
to control both the sale and use of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   However, gun-control advocates say the new Massachusetts gun
safety regulations, and Reilly's promised tough enforcement of
them, goes further than the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement because the
state regulations are mandatory, and affect all gun manufacturers,
not just one company.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the Gun Owners Action League and the National Rifle
Association seeking comment on Reilly's expected enforcement effort
were not returned Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Massachusetts regulations, it is now a violation of
state consumer protection laws to sell, lease, or rent:
</P>
<P>
   --Handguns without specific child-safety features.
</P>
<P>
   --Handguns without state-approved trigger locks and other safety
devices.
</P>
<P>
   --Handguns without tamperproof serial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   --``Junk'' handguns made from inferior materials that are prone
to explosion or accidental discharge.
</P>
<P>
   --Semi-automatic handguns without a load indicator or magazine
safety disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Features of the Masssachusetts gun regulations were incorporated
into the Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement, in which the company agreed to
put safety locks on its guns, add ``smart gun'' technology to new
guns to prevent unauthorized usage, and not to peddle weapons at
gun shows where background checks of buyers are not carried out.

<P>
   SCHOOL-INTEGRATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Less than half a century
after the Supreme Court ruled that school segregation was
unconstitutional, are efforts to achieve racially integrated public
schools legally and politically doomed? A look at recent court
rulings that are making it hard for public schools to maintain even
a semblance of racial diversity in a judicial and political climate
that exalts choice above all other values. By Jeffrey Rosen. WITH
GRAPHIC. (Moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   GYPSIES-REVIEW (Pavlovce Nad Uhom, Slovakia) _ The Gypsies, or
Roma, are the new Europe's stateless people, at least 8 million of
them scattered and mostly reviled throughout Central and Eastern
Europe. While half a million Roma died in the Holocaust, which the
Roma call ``the devouring,'' they remain the one people in the
modern, democratic, post-communist Europe whom it is largely
acceptable to persecute. By Steven Erlanger. (Moved in `i'

</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-MARKET-REVIEW (Undated) _ Given the transformation of
American medicine over the past 75 years, Dr. Martin Solomon, a
central figure in a PBS ``Frontline'' documentary, has little in
common with Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, the hero of Sinclair Lewis'
famous 1925 novel that bears his name. But they share a chronic
discontent: a feeling that they are trapped between the duty to
practice their profession conscientiously and the pressures of a
market society. The complaint, rooted in a clash between the
principles of Hippocrates and those of Adam Smith, may not be fully
curable. By Walter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ABBY-COHEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Never underestimate the power of
Abby Joseph Cohen, the ubiquitous chief investment strategist for
Goldman, Sachs. Last week, she almost singlehandedly caused a broad
sell-off in markets worldwide. ``When she speaks, markets move,''
said one trader. And not just markets. Cohen, who appears
frequently on TV, usually just discusses Wall Street, which has
left the rest of the world badly in need of guidance. But all that
just might change in the months to come, if the guru breaks out and
enters other spheres of influence. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   ALEX-COMFORT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Dr. Alex Comfort personified the
sort of tweedy English intellectual who could gracefully range from
subject to subject and from literary form to form. He was a
physician, poet, novelist, anarchist, pacifist and a leading
researcher on how people age. He was best known as the author of
``The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking'' but a glance at
his other writings reveals a dazzlingly multi-faceted mind. By
Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-WOMEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon has tried to
emphasize milestones it has achieved in advancing the standing of
women in the nation's armed services. A provocative new book, ``The
Kinder, Gentler Military, '' challenges the sanguine image the
Pentagon would like to convey of equality in the military's
increasing co-ed ranks. The author, Stephanie Gutmann, accuses the
Pentagon's civilian and military leaders of dangerously eroding
U.S. military might in a politically correct pursuit to expand
women's opportunities. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-STUDY-REVIEW (Undated) _ American researchers studying AIDS
tracked heterosexual couples in Uganda. In each case, one partner
was already infected, and the doctors did not tell the uninfected
partner that the other had HIV. After receiving intensive
instruction on how to prevent transmission, and access to free
condoms, the couples were followed for more than two years.
Anti-viral drugs were withheld. When the study ended, 90 more
people were HIV-infected. Many doctors have asked how such studies
in the developing world can be justified on moral grounds. By
Jerome Groopman.
</P>
<P>
   MONETARY-POLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan has been trying, with little success so far, to cool off
an economy that is threatening to overheat and impose a degree of
temperance on Wall Street's long-running party. It is not just
Greenspan whose clout is in question. Given that companies,
consumers and investors have proven largely impervious to a series
of rate hikes by the Fed, economists are wondering whether monetary
policy still works, or at least whether it works the same way it
used to. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-NOW-CLOCK-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ The Clock of the Long
Now is a much-anticipated clock designed by the inventor and
scientist Danny Hillis to measure the next 10,000 years and beyond.
The prototype clock, an exquisite object standing some 9 feet high,
has been called the world's slowest-moving computer. Part magic box
and part conceptual art, the clock has become the cause celebre of
a heady cadre of Bay Area thinkers and futurists. By Patricia Leigh
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   RENO-ELIAN-REVIEW (Washington) _ Attorney General Janet Reno's
friends and long-time associates say the Elian Gonzalez case has
been especially difficult for her because it is roiling the city
where she was born, grew up and served for 15 years as an immensely
popular state attorney. Miami is also the place where she plans to
return after she leaves the office of attorney general in January,
to live in the ranch house that her mother built on the edge of the
Everglades. By Don Van Natta.

   SCHOOL-INTEGRATION-REVIEW (Undated) _ Less than half a century
after the Supreme Court ruled that school segregation was
unconstitutional, are efforts to achieve racially integrated public
schools legally and politically doomed? A look at recent court
rulings that are making it hard for public schools to maintain even
a semblance of racial diversity in a judicial and political climate

   GYPSIES-REVIEW (Pavlovce Nad Uhom, Slovakia) _ The Gypsies, or
Roma, are the new Europe's stateless people, at least 8 million of
them scattered and mostly reviled throughout Central and Eastern
Europe. While half a million Roma died in the Holocaust, which the
Roma call ``the devouring,'' they remain the one people in the
modern, democratic, post-communist Europe whom it is largely
acceptable to persecute. By Steven Erlanger. (Moved in `i'

   HEALTHCARE-MARKET-REVIEW (Undated) _ Given the transformation of
American medicine over the past 75 years, Dr. Martin Solomon, a
central figure in a PBS ``Frontline'' documentary, has little in
common with Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, the hero of Sinclair Lewis'
famous 1925 novel that bears his name. But they share a chronic
discontent: a feeling that they are trapped between the duty to
practice their profession conscientiously and the pressures of a
market society. The complaint, rooted in a clash between the
principles of Hippocrates and those of Adam Smith, may not be fully
curable. By Walter Goodman.

   ABBY-COHEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ Never underestimate the power of
Abby Joseph Cohen, the ubiquitous chief investment strategist for
Goldman, Sachs. Last week, she almost singlehandedly caused a broad
sell-off in markets worldwide. ``When she speaks, markets move,''
said one trader. And not just markets. Cohen, who appears
frequently on TV, usually just discusses Wall Street, which has
left the rest of the world badly in need of guidance. But all that
just might change in the months to come, if the guru breaks out and
enters other spheres of influence. By Alex Berenson.

   ALEX-COMFORT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Dr. Alex Comfort personified the
sort of tweedy English intellectual who could gracefully range from
subject to subject and from literary form to form. He was a
physician, poet, novelist, anarchist, pacifist and a leading
researcher on how people age. He was best known as the author of
``The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking'' but a glance at
his other writings reveals a dazzlingly multi-faceted mind. By

   MILITARY-WOMEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Pentagon has tried to
emphasize milestones it has achieved in advancing the standing of
women in the nation's armed services. A provocative new book, ``The
Kinder, Gentler Military, '' challenges the sanguine image the
Pentagon would like to convey of equality in the military's
increasing co-ed ranks. The author, Stephanie Gutmann, accuses the
Pentagon's civilian and military leaders of dangerously eroding
U.S. military might in a politically correct pursuit to expand
women's opportunities. By Steven Lee Myers.

   AIDS-STUDY-REVIEW (Undated) _ American researchers studying AIDS
tracked heterosexual couples in Uganda. In each case, one partner
was already infected, and the doctors did not tell the uninfected
partner that the other had HIV. After receiving intensive
instruction on how to prevent transmission, and access to free
condoms, the couples were followed for more than two years.
Anti-viral drugs were withheld. When the study ended, 90 more
people were HIV-infected. Many doctors have asked how such studies
in the developing world can be justified on moral grounds. By

   MONETARY-POLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan has been trying, with little success so far, to cool off
an economy that is threatening to overheat and impose a degree of
temperance on Wall Street's long-running party. It is not just
Greenspan whose clout is in question. Given that companies,
consumers and investors have proven largely impervious to a series
of rate hikes by the Fed, economists are wondering whether monetary
policy still works, or at least whether it works the same way it
used to. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   LONG-NOW-CLOCK-REVIEW (San Francisco) _ The Clock of the Long
Now is a much-anticipated clock designed by the inventor and

The prototype clock, an exquisite object standing some 9 feet high,
has been called the world's slowest-moving computer. Part magic box

   RENO-ELIAN-REVIEW (Washington) _ Attorney General Janet Reno's
friends and long-time associates say the Elian Gonzalez case has
been especially difficult for her because it is roiling the city

IN AN AIDS STUDY, THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS

   Imagine a medical study in which researchers are tracking the
progress of HIV in 415 heterosexual American couples. One of the
partners is already infected. The doctors do not tell the
uninfected partner that the other has the virus. After receiving
intensive instruction on how to prevent transmission, and access to
free condoms, the couples are followed for more than two years.
Anti-viral drugs are withheld. When the study ends, 90 more people
are HIV infected.
</P>
<P>
   This is no idle scenario. While the study described above was
conducted mainly by Americans, the setting was rural Uganda. The
results of the study, which began in 1994 and ended in 1998, were
published last week by The New England Journal of Medicine. Even
before last week, many doctors have asked how such studies in the
developing world could be justified on moral grounds.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that the Uganda research, part of a larger
study of sexually transmitted diseases among 15,127 people, was an
opportunity for scientists to observe the progress and spread of a
deadly disease so they could better know how to prevent it in the
future. Withholding treatment, too, might offer the chance to study
when best to intervene. Still, how could American researchers stand
by silently while their subjects contracted the virus? How could
they simply watch as a potentially fatal infection took its natural
course?
</P>
<P>
   The editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Marcia
Angell, raised these questions in an editorial accompanying the
article. Saying that such a study could not have been ethically
conducted in the United States, she believes that it could not be
justified based upon its major research finding: that the more
virus a person carries the more likely he or she is to infect a
sexual partner. The conclusion is of little use to the Africans,
who have no access to therapy. It is more valuable to the developed
world.
</P>
<P>
   Even this finding was hardly surprising. Studies with similar
results involving monkey viruses related to HIV will soon be
published. While imperfect, such animal models can be substituted
when human studies raise moral concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of the study, its leader, Dr. Thomas Quinn of Johns
Hopkins University, said that the research met a ``high ethical
standard.'' Ugandan authorities, he said, insisted that researchers
not inform study subjects that their partners had HIV; only the
infected person could do that. The study was ethical, Quinn said,
``because it provided the best medical care possible in remote
regions of rural Africa.'' The subjects with syphilis and
gonorrhea, which are easily treated, were given antibiotics. Johns
Hopkins approved the research, which was not designed for
therapeutic intervention against the AIDS virus, Quinn said. In
rural Uganda, he contended, there is no way to monitor the
anti-viral drugs, which can be toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge about the natural history of a disease is the
underpinning of all medical decision-making, and serves as the
yardstick with which to measure the risks and benefits of
intervention. Sometimes a refined picture of a disease's history
has invalidated clinical practices based on apparently reasonable
assumptions. Questions still persist about AIDS treatment,
particularly therapy given early in the disease when the immune
system is intact. The assumption that AIDS researchers like myself
make is that it is best to treat early and hard, but this is not
yet proven. Drugs used too early might make patients resistant
later when they need treatment more.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this is found in cancer medicine, my specialty. I
examined a 62-year-old man who had enlarged lymph nodes in his
neck, underarms and groin. A biopsy showed a nonaggressive
lymphoma. He was shocked because he had no symptoms. After studying
laboratory tests, I advised him that treatment was not clearly
required at this stage of the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cancer and you are not going to treat me?'''' he asked
in disbelief. ``This is not some kind of experiment, is it?''
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the conventional wisdom had been to treat
lymphoma early. But in the 1970s, studies found that immediate
treatment for this kind of lymphoma was not always in the patient's
best interests because it neither extended survival nor improved
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Other disorders have now been shown to benefit from early
treatment. Initially, physicians had scant information on hepatitis
C, and many concluded that the hepatitis C virus was relatively
innocuous, because it seemed to damage the liver minimally. Few
advised their patients about the risk of sexual transmission;
therapy was not recommended. Recent studies show that early,
aggressive anti-viral therapy can protect the liver and sometimes
eradicate the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for medical data has included extremes in which humans
were treated as subhuman. Some of the most accurate information
about tissue damage and death due to exposure to cold comes from
Nazi experiments on concentration camp inmates. The myriad
manifestations of syphilis were meticulously charted in the
infamous Tuskegee study, in which black men were not treated with
penicillin so that researchers could continue collecting results.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the abominable Tuskegee trials and the
study in Uganda is that anti-HIV drugs were unavailable to rural
Ugandans. Treatment would also not be routinely provided after the
research ended. The absence of such drugs was consistent with the
status quo. Some would argue that although Uganda lacked the
resources to monitor drug safety in remote areas, all the subjects
in a clinical research study deserve to benefit fully from their
participation in it.
</P>
<P>
   If information were available showing that the Ugandans were of
early-stage infection, and not in clear need of drugs, a moral
argument could be better made to justify the failure to offer
anti-viral treatment. But these data are absent. ``I wish such
T-cell data could be gotten in rural Africa,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The issues here go well beyond this particular study and HIV.
Scientists are rapidly identifying disease-causing genes and new
microbes. The thirst for data on the natural history of an illness
need not divert researchers from moral standards. Medical
scientists can design studies that keep the developing world from
turning into a laboratory for experiments that they would not
perform in their own clinics.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan is among the most powerful men in
the world. As chairman of the Federal Reserve, he can alter the
course of the economy by moving interest rates up and down. His
pronouncements can send shudders through markets around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems as Greenspan tries, with little success so far,
to cool off an economy that is threatening to overheat and impose a
degree of temperance on Wall Street's long-running party.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Greenspan whose clout is in question. Given that
companies, consumers and investors have proven largely impervious
to a series of rate hikes by the Fed, economists are wondering
whether monetary policy still works, or at least whether it works
the same way it used to.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has pushed interest rates up five times since June. In
the meantime, the economy has continued thundering along at a pace
well above what most economists think is sustainable over the long
run without generating inflation. The government reported last week
that the economy grew at a 7.3 percent annual rate in the last
quarter of 1999, its fastest pace in 16 years, and all the signs
are that growth has moderated only slightly so far in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although stock prices have taken to gyrating wildly, and the
high-flying technology stocks in the Nasdaq index have been hit
hard, the trend on Wall Street has remained upward. And long-term
interest rates have not risen nearly as much as would be expected
when the Fed is driving up the official short-term rates it
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates take time to filter through the economy,
and their full effect may not be felt until later this year. But
the economy and the markets are clearly absorbing the Fed's rate
hikes with a somewhat perplexing equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy usually works with a lag of six to nine
months, so you shouldn't really expect the rate increases that
occurred starting in mid-1999 to have a noticeable impact on the
economy before the second quarter of this year,'' said L. Douglas
Lee of Economics from Washington, a consulting firm. ``Having said
that, the economy is not as sensitive to interest rate increases as
it used to be. This makes it tougher for the Fed to slow things
down by raising interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   In textbooks, monetary policy sounds pretty simple. Fed
officials make a judgment about how fast the economy can grow
without igniting inflation, based on the growth of the working
population and improvements in productivity. (Over the last few
years those estimates have risen to nearly 4 percent, from just
over 2 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   When growth exceeds that rate over a sustained period, the Fed
drives up the short-term interest rates it controls. Banks then
charge more for loans. The bond market pushes up corporate
borrowing rates. Stock prices come under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   With mortgages and auto loans more expensive, and people feeling
less wealthy, consumers buy fewer houses and cars. With their costs
rising and sales slowing, companies might choose to close a plant,
or not to open a new one. Jobs become less plentiful. The economy
slows and inflation fades.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, it is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, although growth rates are well above what almost
anyone thinks is sustainable over the long run, there is almost no
inflation. Moreover, the economy and the markets are changing in
ways that tend to dampen the effect of rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Take mortgages. Rates on traditional fixed-rate mortgages have
shot up over the last year. But homebuyers have learned to maintain
their purchasing power by shifting into adjustable rate mortgages,
which initially carry lower monthly payments. Lee said that at the
beginning of 1999, while rates were quite low, only about 10
percent of homebuyers were choosing adjustable mortgages. By the
end of last year 30 percent of homebuyers were choosing
adjustables. As a result, home sales, a key driver of economic
growth, have kept running at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, much of the economic growth in recent years has come
from advances in technology, and technology companies carry
relatively little debt compared with their ``old economy'' cousins
in capital-intensive fields like manufacturing. Companies with
little debt are less sensitive to rising rates than those with big
debt loads, and are therefore less likely to cut back as the Fed
tightens policy.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between old- and new-economy companies is just
one reason the financial markets have not reacted much to the Fed's
tighter monetary policy. Another is psychological: investors have
become so conditioned to Greenspan keeping the economy on an even
keel that they are concentrating not on the pain he is seeking to
inflict on them through rate increases but on the presumed outcome
of his efforts _ an economy that continues growing steadily with
little inflation. Greenspan is in some ways a victim of his own
success.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same phenomenon is at work in the bond market. Because
the government is running huge budget surpluses, the Treasury is
paying off the national debt. In doing so, the government is
creating a shortage of Treasury bonds, driving up the price of
those bonds and driving down the interest rate they carry. In
effect, the Treasury and the Fed are working at cross purposes.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been a call for the Fed to reexamine the tools it
uses. If the key to bringing the economy's growth down to a
sustainable level is reining in the stock market, as Greenspan
says, then perhaps he should consider aiming his fire directly at
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, pressure is mounting on Greenspan to tighten the
rules on buying stocks with borrowed money. But Greenspan has
repeatedly replied that such a move could not be counted on to have
any effect on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed will no doubt continue using its imperfect though not
impotent interest rate tool. And Greenspan may find that he has to
raise rates further, and in bigger increments, than he would
prefer.

to a series of rate hikes by the Fed, economists are wondering
whether monetary policy still works, or at least whether it works
the same way it used to.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has pushed interest rates up five times since June. In
the meantime, the economy has continued thundering along at a pace
well above what most economists think is sustainable over the long
run without generating inflation. The government reported last week
that the economy grew at a 7.3 percent annual rate in the last
quarter of 1999, its fastest pace in 16 years, and all the signs
are that growth has moderated only slightly so far in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although stock prices have taken to gyrating wildly, and the
high-flying technology stocks in the Nasdaq index have been hit
hard, the trend on Wall Street has remained upward. And long-term
interest rates have not risen nearly as much as would be expected
when the Fed is driving up the official short-term rates it
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates take time to filter through the economy,
and their full effect may not be felt until later this year. But
the economy and the markets are clearly absorbing the Fed's rate
hikes with a somewhat perplexing equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monetary policy usually works with a lag of six to nine
months, so you shouldn't really expect the rate increases that
occurred starting in mid-1999 to have a noticeable impact on the
economy before the second quarter of this year,'' said L. Douglas
Lee of Economics from Washington, a consulting firm. ``Having said
that, the economy is not as sensitive to interest rate increases as
it used to be. This makes it tougher for the Fed to slow things
down by raising interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   In textbooks, monetary policy sounds pretty simple. Fed
officials make a judgment about how fast the economy can grow
without igniting inflation, based on the growth of the working
population and improvements in productivity. (Over the last few
years those estimates have risen to nearly 4 percent, from just
over 2 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   When growth exceeds that rate over a sustained period, the Fed
drives up the short-term interest rates it controls. Banks then
charge more for loans. The bond market pushes up corporate
borrowing rates. Stock prices come under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   With mortgages and auto loans more expensive, and people feeling
less wealthy, consumers buy fewer houses and cars. With their costs
rising and sales slowing, companies might choose to close a plant,
or not to open a new one. Jobs become less plentiful. The economy
slows and inflation fades.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, it is more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, although growth rates are well above what almost
anyone thinks is sustainable over the long run, there is almost no
inflation. Moreover, the economy and the markets are changing in
ways that tend to dampen the effect of rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Take mortgages. Rates on traditional fixed-rate mortgages have
shot up over the last year. But homebuyers have learned to maintain
their purchasing power by shifting into adjustable rate mortgages,
which initially carry lower monthly payments. Lee said that at the
beginning of 1999, while rates were quite low, only about 10
percent of homebuyers were choosing adjustable mortgages. By the
end of last year 30 percent of homebuyers were choosing
adjustables. As a result, home sales, a key driver of economic
growth, have kept running at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, much of the economic growth in recent years has come
from advances in technology, and technology companies carry
relatively little debt compared with their ``old economy'' cousins
in capital-intensive fields like manufacturing. Companies with
little debt are less sensitive to rising rates than those with big
debt loads, and are therefore less likely to cut back as the Fed
tightens policy.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between old- and new-economy companies is just
one reason the financial markets have not reacted much to the Fed's
tighter monetary policy. Another is psychological: investors have
become so conditioned to Greenspan keeping the economy on an even
keel that they are concentrating not on the pain he is seeking to
inflict on them through rate increases but on the presumed outcome
of his efforts _ an economy that continues growing steadily with
little inflation. Greenspan is in some ways a victim of his own
success.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same phenomenon is at work in the bond market. Because
the government is running huge budget surpluses, the Treasury is
paying off the national debt. In doing so, the government is
creating a shortage of Treasury bonds, driving up the price of
those bonds and driving down the interest rate they carry. In
effect, the Treasury and the Fed are working at cross purposes.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been a call for the Fed to reexamine the tools it
uses. If the key to bringing the economy's growth down to a
sustainable level is reining in the stock market, as Greenspan
says, then perhaps he should consider aiming his fire directly at
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, pressure is mounting on Greenspan to tighten the
rules on buying stocks with borrowed money. But Greenspan has
repeatedly replied that such a move could not be counted on to have
any effect on stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed will no doubt continue using its imperfect though not
impotent interest rate tool. And Greenspan may find that he has to
raise rates further, and in bigger increments, than he would
prefer.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ With a clickety-click and a Zen Buddhist gong
punctuating the ceremony, some of the people most associated with
the dizzying acceleration of the culture ushered in slowness as the
new frontier. They activated the prototype of The Clock of the Long
Now, the tool designed to measure the next 10,000 years and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hours are an arbitrary artifact of our culture,'' said Danny
Hillis, the clock's inventor and the scientist who pioneered the
concept of parallel computers that is now the basis of most
supercomputers. ``The chance of people using hours 10,000 years
from now is probably pretty low.''
</P>
<P>
   Its spiraling pendulum now slowly twisting, the prototype, an
exquisite 9-foot-tall object that first began keeping time
welcoming that millennial New Year's Eve, has been called the
world's slowest-moving computer. Constructed of brass and monel, a
nickel and copper alloy, the clock slightly resembles a futuristic
jukebox that computes using mechanics instead of electronic
circuitry to calculate extremely slow increments of time. The
prototype _ which will travel to the London Science Museum this
summer _ tracks the moon's position and phase, local rising and
setting times of sun and moon, equinoxes, solstices and the
Gregorian calendar up to 10,000 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Nahum, project director of ``The Making of the Modern
World,'' the exhibit on the history of technology in London, called
the clock ``an example of sublime technology,'' not only because of
its ingenious mechanics but also because of its ``moral
reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years in a Sausalito machine shop, the prototype
made its public debut recently at the TED Conference, the annual
powwow for the New Economy's power elite in Monterey. Part
latter-day ``magic box,'' as John Harrison's 18th-century
longitude-tracking chronometer was called, part conceptual art, the
clock has become the cause celebre of a heady cadre of Bay Area
thinkers and futurists, among them Esther Dyson, the author;
Douglas G. Carlston, the co-founder of Broderbund software; Kevin
Kelly, founding editor of Wired, and Stewart Brand, creator of The
Whole Earth catalog and the early online community the Well. Ever
the phrase-coiner, Brand calls the clock ``a patience machine'' and
``a steam engine for the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his cohorts, Brand started The Long Now Foundation
(``long now'' is a reference to deep time coined by the British
musician Brian Eno) to raise money for the project, which is to
include a separate digital linguistic archive with the Book of
Genesis in a thousand languages. The long-term plan is to build an
80- to 90-foot version of the clock and ensconce it among the
bristle-cone-pine forested limestone cliffs of White Pine County,
Nev., literally the middle of nowhere. The foundation has already
bought 186 acres adjoining Great Basin National Park. The idea is
to do for thinking about time what photographs of Earth from space
did for thinking about the environment, to ``reframe human
endeavor,'' Brand said, ``not with a thesis but a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a thing. Its fastest dial moves once a day; the
slowest, once every 10,000 years and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   As an artifact projected to be accurate to within one day every
20,000 years, the clock may be seen as a grandiose atonement for
the sins of Internet time, or perhaps the ultimate boy-toy. The
prototype, now sitting at the foundation's headquarters in The
Presidio, an old general store building with creaking stairs and
lumpy plaster, breaks new technical ground.
</P>
<P>
   Its most riveting feature may be the ``Equation of Time'' cam,
which looks like a sculptured torso but is actually a mathematical
calculation rendered in three-dimensional form. It measures the
26,000-year precession of the equinoxes, Hillis said, accounting
precisely for elliptical eccentricities in the Earth's orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The most heavenly looking element is the face, a rotating black
sphere that charts the paths of the stars, one of the oldest forms
of telling time. A measuring device called a rete traces the stars'
positions over millennia. (For instance, 13,000 years from now,
Vega will be where Polaris is _ in the center of the clock's star
field.)
</P>
<P>
   In designing his antidote to civilization's ``pathologically
short attention span,'' as the Long Now literature puts it, Hillis
(who once made a computer out of Tinkertoys) has tried to learn
from the mistakes of previous long-range messages like the Phaistos
disc unearthed in Crete in 1908, which features 241 symbols in an
ancient form of Greek that predates Homer. Instead, he looked to
Big Ben, the work of an inspired amateur named C.B. Denison, and
places like New College, Oxford, where a 19th-century
reconstruction of the main hall used 14th-century oak trees planted
in anticipation of a day hundreds of years in the future when the
beams might need replacing.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial philosophical conceit of the clock may be
that it was deliberately designed to require human winding, an idea
meant to foster the idea of responsibility. How it would be wound
and by whom has yet to be determined. Maybe a ritual, like
Stairmasters, offered Brand.
</P>
<P>
   To Dr. Gregory Benford, a professor of physics at the University
of California at Irvine and author of ``Deep Time: How Humanity
Communicates Across Millennia'' (Avon, 1999), the clock is noble
but flawed. ``It's too pretty,'' he said. ``The first biker gang to
come along is going to trash this thing. If they made it rugged and
ugly, it might last.''
</P>
<P>
   At the foundation's offices in the Presidio, a 22-pound tungsten
pendulum bob lay on a table _ the ultimate geek paperweight. Donors
of $50,000 or more can get one of their very own with an unusual
set of instructions: Care and maintenance of your pendulum bob
mostly involves preventing people from dropping it on their toes.
With proper care, it should outlast your civilization.
</P>
<P>
   In a profound sense, the clock, a jewel-like gesture toward the
infinite, reflects deep anxiety about time in an increasingly
whirlwindish culture. ``It's about the coming of age of the kids
who were going to save the world,'' Benford observed. ``And like
all deep-time monoliths, it's a mirror.''

RENO'S MIAMI STANDOFF: WHEN POLICY AND PERSONAL HISTORY MIX 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1980, a race riot in Miami confronted Janet Reno
with the first crisis of her public life. As state attorney of
Miami-Dade County, Reno had failed to win the convictions of four
white police officers charged with the beating death of a black
insurance salesman. In the streets below her office window, an
angry mob chanted, ``Reno! Reno! Reno!''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, the specter of another public disturbance in
her hometown has shaped Reno's response to the escalating Elian
Gonzalez immigration drama. In a series of emotional and personal
remarks last week, U.S. Attorney General Reno appealed to Miami's
Cuban-American community to peacefully accept the return of
6-year-old Elian to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has been heartbreaking for everybody involved,''
Reno said. ``But we believe that the law is clear. Elian should be
reunited with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980 riots, Reno has always been cautious in assessing
and responding to a potential confrontation. She has kept her own
counsel (one friend said Reno ``uses three words when five would be
all right''), and been criticized for it. In 1993, for example,
during the long standoff at Waco, Texas, which began just weeks
after she was sworn in as attorney general, Reno said very little
publicly and is still considered by some to be hiding the truth of
that fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno grapples with the Elian case, she is again being
criticized for her deliberate approach to an emotionally and
politically charged case and is even being blamed for worsening the
conflict. This time, however, she is being uncharacteristically
talkative.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends and associates say she is convinced that
communication with her former neighbors in Miami is the best way to
insure that the international tug-of-war over Elian does not end in
a very ugly way. They also say that the Elian case has been
especially difficult for her because it is roiling the city where
she was born, grew up and served for 15 years as an immensely
popular state attorney. She is also convinced it is the best way to
ensure that the international tug-of-war over a small boy does not
end in ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, relatives of Elian said they would not turn the boy
over to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, even if he comes for a
visit, and suggested that they may not hand him over to the
authorities, even if they lose their custody case in court. The
lawyers also questioned the father's fitness as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said they would revoke the boy's
right to remain in the United States on Tuesday unless his
great-uncle signs an agreement to hand Elian over, peacefully and
painlessly, if the relatives lose their custody case after legal
appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's concern over events in the community intensified last
week, her friends say, after Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade
County said that local police authorities would not help the
federal government remove Elian from Miami. The remarks were viewed
by some as an invitation to civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the case, most immigration and
international law experts have criticized the attorney general for
not moving quickly enough to return Elian to his father. Jan Ting,
a former assistant commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said that it was ``an abject act of
spinelessness'' that the Justice Department has continued to engage
in lengthy negotiations with Elian's Miami relatives over the
conditions of the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every immigration authority I know of outside of Dade County,
Florida, agrees that the administration had legal authority to
return Elian to his father as soon as they confirmed the father's
identity and fitness,'' said Ting, who is a professor of law at
Temple University's Deasley School of Law. ``Ironically, the local
officials may be right in saying that President Clinton and
Attorney General Reno are responsible for any civil disorder in
Miami, not because of their action but because of their inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand Reno's handling of this matter, one must look to
her long public career in Miami, where she presided over _ and
survived _ race riots, crime waves, drug cartels, massive influxes
of immigrants and brazen acts of political and judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is an international and national issue, the
fact of the matter is all politics are local, and this is a local
issue and she's very sensitive to that,'' said Jeffrey Weiner, a
Miami defense lawyer who has known Reno for 26 years. ``Had this
been handled by an attorney general who was not from South Florida,
it would probably have ended a long time ago. She really felt the
pain of the riots here. I think it has contributed to her
insistence that this play out in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno refuses to speculate about Miami's response to
Elian's departure _ ``I don't do what-ifs,'' she said _ friends say
her comments were intended to quell the community's intense anger.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's negotiations occurred at the home of Elian's Miami
relatives, which was often surrounded by a human chain of angry
Cuban-Americans who believe that the U.S. government is plotting to
drug Elian to expedite his swift return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, however, has thus far remained patient. When she was asked
about her reaction to last week's ABC interview with Elian, who
insisted that he did not want to return to Cuba, she replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people understand a 6-year-old. And I can
remember, I loved to go to my grandmother's house. She had such a
wonderful house, and she cooked us biscuits just right, and she
loved us. And she took us to the movies, and she got us French
vanilla ice cream. And she read to us, and she taught us to play
cards. She was a wonderful lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it came Sunday afternoon, and I'd run around behind the
house and hide because I didn't want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said it is easy for her to understand why Elian wishes to
remain with his great-uncle in the United States. ``I think they
are his own feelings,'' she said. ``They were certainly my feelings
when I ran behind the house and cried and didn't want to go home.''

   Since the 1980 riots, Reno has always been cautious in assessing
and responding to a potential confrontation. She has kept her own
counsel (one friend said Reno ``uses three words when five would be
all right''), and been criticized for it. In 1993, for example,
during the long standoff at Waco, Texas, which began just weeks
after she was sworn in as attorney general, Reno said very little
publicly and is still considered by some to be hiding the truth of
that fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   As Reno grapples with the Elian case, she is again being
criticized for her deliberate approach to an emotionally and
politically charged case and is even being blamed for worsening the
conflict. This time, however, she is being uncharacteristically
talkative.
</P>
<P>
   Her friends and associates say she is convinced that
communication with her former neighbors in Miami is the best way to
insure that the international tug-of-war over Elian does not end in
a very ugly way. They also say that the Elian case has been
especiall difficult for her because it is roiling the city where
she was born, grew up and served for 15 years as an immensely
popular state attorney. She is also convinced it is the best way to
ensure that the international tug-of-war over a small boy does not
end in ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, relatives of Elian said they would not turn the boy
over to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, even if he comes for a
visit, and suggested that they may not hand him over to the
authorities, even if they lose their custody case in court. The
lawyers also questioned the father's fitness as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have said they would revoke the boy's
right to remain in the United States on Tuesday unless his
great-uncle signs an agreement to hand Elian over, peacefully and
painlessly, if the relatives lose their custody case after legal
appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's concern over events in the community intensified last
week, her friends say, after Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade
County said that local police authorities would not help the
federal government remove Elian from Miami. The remarks were viewed
by some as an invitation to civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of the case, most immigration and
international law experts have criticized the attorney general for
not moving quickly enough to return Elian to his father. Jan Ting,
a former assistant commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said that it was ``an abject act of
spinelessness'' that the Justice Department has continued to engage
in lengthy negotiations with Elian's Miami relatives over the
conditions of the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every immigration authority I know of outside of Dade County,
Florida, agrees that the administration had legal authority to
return Elian to his father as soon as they confirmed the father's
identity and fitness,'' said Ting, who is a professor of law at
Temple University's Deasley School of Law. ``Ironically, the local
officials may be right in saying that President Clinton and
Attorney General Reno are responsible for any civil disorder in
Miami, not because of their action but because of their inaction.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand Reno's handling of this matter, one must look to
her long public career in Miami, where she presided over _ and
survived _ race riots, crime waves, drug cartels, massive influxes
of immigrants and brazen acts of political and judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is an international and national issue, the
fact of the matter is all politics are local, and this is a local
issue and she's very sensitive to that,'' said Jeffrey Weiner, a
Miami defense lawyer who has known Reno for 26 years. ``Had this
been handled by an attorney general who was not from South Florida,
it would probably have ended a long time ago. She really felt the
pain of the riots here. I think it has contributed to her
insistence that this play out in the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno refuses to speculate about Miami's response to
Elian's departure _ ``I don't do what-ifs,'' she said _ friends say
her comments were intended to quell the community's intense anger.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's negotiations occurred at the home of Elian's Miami
relatives, which was often surrounded by a human chain of angry
Cuban-Americans who believe that the U.S. government is plotting to
drug Elian to expedite his swift return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, however, has thus far remained patient. When she was asked
about her reaction to last week's ABC interview with Elian, who
insisted that he did not want to return to Cuba, she replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people understand a 6-year-old. And I can
remember, I loved to go to my grandmother's house. She had such a
wonderful house, and she cooked us biscuits just right, and she
loved us. And she took us to the movies, and she got us French
vanilla ice cream. And she read to us, and she taught us to play
cards. She was a wonderful lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it came Sunday afternoon, and I'd run around behind the
house and hide because I didn't want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said it is easy for her to understand why Elian wishes to
remain with his great-uncle in the United States. ``I think they
are his own feelings,'' she said. ``They were certainly my feelings
when I ran behind the house and cried and didn't want to go home.''

GOD IS MY CO-PILOT: PACKING A BIBLE AND LOLLING WITH THE
VATICANISTI

   ROME _ The true nuttiness of papal coverage hit me in the Old
City of Jerusalem, when members of the Vatican press corps
following the pope's historic pilgrimage to the Holy Land were
standing tensely outside a mosque behind a wall of Israeli police
officers, waiting for John Paul II to end his meeting with the
mufti of Jerusalem and pray at the Western Wall, Judaism's most
sacred place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a Lutheran! I finally found a Lutheran!'' my German
colleague, the correspondent for the Axel-Springer newspaper chain,
shouted exultantly. A first-rate reporter who closely monitors the
pope's moods and fading health with binoculars, a handheld
television set and a tape recorder equipped with a tiny video
camera, Andreas Englisch explained that his editors in Berlin were
constantly pressing him to find a local German angle to even the
most extraordinary moments of John Paul II's pontificate.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, traveling with the pope is a little like
covering the White House or a presidential campaign: long bus
rides, early wake-up calls, bunker camaraderie, cell phones,
laptops and an obsessive thirst for advance copies of his speeches
(homilies, in church parlance).
</P>
<P>
   But Vatican reporters, unlike their political colleagues, spend
a lot of time in church _ and are gently encouraged to spend even
more. On Sunday nights during a trip, a priest says Mass at a hotel
room for reporters who had to work through the pope's Mass earlier
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Political reporters hit the road carrying their bible, the
Almanac of American Politics. Vatican reporters carry the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps to the envy of colleagues who spent the last five
months listening to Sen. John McCain, the pope isn't running for
anything and we never interview him.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, 79 and now very frail, rarely comes to the back of his
chartered plane to chat with reporters anymore. The only time he
has done it in the last two years was on the way to Mexico City and
St. Louis, Mo. Weak, his speech slurred, the pope grimly noted the
global triumph of unfettered American-style capitalism. ``For
better or worse, there is only one superpower left,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, like the Kremlin, has little sense of public
accountability. That means sparse disclosure of even basic
information about the pope's health, Vatican finances or shifts in
Curia policy. Spinning, an art form perfected by American political
advisers to shape reporters' coverage, is also limited. For
example, on trips, the Vatican spokesman, Dr. Joaquin
Navarro-Valls, will occasionally pop up after a Mass to brief the
press pack in three languages. (``The Holy Father was deeply moved,
but I did not see him weep, no.'')
</P>
<P>
   We rarely see the pope up close, relying on binoculars and
television to track his declining health. He travels with two
doctors. His chief physician, the tall, elegant Dr. Renato
Buzzonetti, answers all questions about the pontiff's health by
smiling silkily and saying, ``Bene, grazie.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, whose left hand trembles uncontrollably from
Parkinson's disease and who walks with a cane in a stiff, painful
shuffle, held up amazingly well throughout the six-day pilgrimage
to the Holy Land. But in Georgia last November, he was shaking so
badly in a cold, damp Orthodox church that Italian reporters,
receiving cell phone reports from their editors in Rome watching
him on television, wrote alarmist stories about his endangered
health. I was in the church, 10 feet away from him, but hemmed in
by hundreds of jostling Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic
believers, saw nothing. Just as well, since by the next morning, he
looked and sounded fine.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro-Valls tells reporters that when aides implore their boss
to take it easy, the pope retorts, ``I'll have all eternity to
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of the pope is respectful, a tribute to his position,
and also to his extraordinary personality and will power. But those
of us who work for mainstream, secular news organizations generally
focus on the broad political and social ramifications of this
pope's words and actions (as well as Vatican intrigue) more closely
than on his purely religious message. Many of the reporters in the
press corps, however, work for Catholic newspapers and magazines,
with inevitably different notions of what their readers need to
know and what they are likely to find interesting.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope was scolded in Poland last summer by the grand
rabbi of Warsaw, who called him ``pope'' and demanded that the
Catholic Church remove the last cross from Auschwitz, the
unscripted moment became a front page story for mainstream news
publications. But French and Italian religion reporters shrugged it
off as a ``provincial issue,'' and focused instead on the spiritual
significance of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa.

</P>
<P>
   Bus chatter often varies along the same lines. Just as political
reporters give odds on primaries and polls, the papal pack
handicaps cardinals.  &UR;  &LR;  After a Mass in Austria attended by many
European cardinals, I recall sitting with Victor Simpson of the
Associated Press, weighing the papal chances of Cardinal Jean Marie
Lustiger, archbishop of Paris (too old, too brainy, too French but
a favorite long shot of the press corps because he is a convert.
The headlines would read, ``Conclave Selects First Jewish Pope.'')
 &UR;  &LR;  Behind us, Guillaume Goubert, the correspondent for the French
Catholic newspaper, La Croix, was deep in a theological debate with
Caroline Bouan, the correspondent for I. Media, another Catholic
publication.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, sometimes display a sense of worldliness. Asked by
ELCI, a French version of CNN, for commentary on the pope's sermon
on the Mount of Beatitudes, Goubert shrugged. ``OK, but it's a
little spi, '' he replied, using French slang for ``spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their publication, different nationalities have
different working styles. The Americans and Germans, true to type A
stereotype, attend every event, record every utterance, and
conscientiously deliver pool reports to their colleagues. The
Italian vaticanisti, who are close in spirit to British royal
watchers, rely more on their own richly intuitive insights and
unnamed sources in the Curia. They skip the Masses and reserve
their energy for uncovering the one good restaurant with decent
local wines.
</P>
<P>
   Most cardinals and bishops have limited experience talking to
reporters and, in chance encounters, sometimes speak quite freely.
During the pope's visit, Israeli officials were nervous about his
trip on Friday to the Sea of Galilee, which would force his
entourage _ and hundreds of Israeli security officers _ to work on
the Sabbath, offending Orthodox rabbis. The pope flew by helicopter
to Jerusalem that night. To spare Orthodox sensitivities, the
bishops, with the rest of the entourage, flew to Tel Aviv and then
traveled by car to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   As evening fell on Capernaum, where the pope was praying at the
ruins of the house that tradition says belonged to St. Peter, I
sidled up to two bishops and, remarking on the late hour, asked
them if they were worried about breaking the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, a local bishop, gave me a long look and replied,
``Funny, you don't look observant.'' They both laughed heartily.

   Stealing Each Other's Thunder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One major-party presidential candidate proposed a
multibillion-dollar package of education reforms last week. The
other asserted that a 6-year-old Cuban boy, rescued offshore
Florida, should be made a permanent resident of the United States
and his father should be lured to the United States with a similar
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Which candidate was the Democrat, and which the Republican?
</P>
<P>
   At this early juncture of the general election campaign, Gov.
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
nominees, are staking claims to positions that belie political
stereotypes. It was the Republican, Bush, who sought to make a
traditional Democratic issue, education, his own, by unveiling an
education plan that included a $5-billion proposal to fight
childhood illiteracy and a five-year, $2.9 billion initiative to
improve teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the Democrat, Gore, who, backing away from the
Clinton administration on one of the most politically sensitive
issues of the year, announced his belief that Elian Gonzalez should
be granted permanent residency status in the United States and that
his father should be offered the same, rather than leaving a return
to Cuba as the only way to reunite them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's move so startled Democratic allies _ ``Oh my God, it's
unbelievable!'' declared one official _ that some, like Rep. Maxine
Waters of California, said that they might have to reconsider their
support for Gore. While some liberal Democrats said he was making
an irresponsible vote grab that played politics with a little boy's
emotional state, there was no denying how important those votes, in
the pivotal state of Florida, might be to him in November.
</P>
<P>
   In embracing these positions, Bush and Gore appeared to be
inching closer to each other ideologically: Gore, after all, has
also offered an education program, amounting to $115 billion in aid
over 10 years. And Bush has long been arguing that Elian's father
should leave Cuba and be with his son in the United States, rather
than having the boy sent back to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   And both found ways to demonstrate how in sync they are with the
popular Sen. John McCain. Included in Bush's education proposals,
for instance, was money for one of McCain's favored projects,
enlisting military retirees as teachers. Gore, meanwhile, announced
his desire to raise $7.1 billion as an endowment fund for the
underwriting of House and Senate races beginning in 2008, even if
he did acknowledge that he was ``an imperfect messenger'' for
campaign finance reform.

   The Art War Guns Fall Silent &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it began last fall, it was the political equivalent of holy
war. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denounced the Brooklyn
Museum of Art's ``Sensation'' exhibit as sacrilege. The museum's
defenders denounced the mayor as an enemy of freedom. The mayor cut
off the museum's funding. The museum took the city to federal
court. For a while it looked as if neither would ever bend.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. This is New York, where politics (almost) always bends to
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Giuliani agreed to abandon his campaign against the
museum, which had provoked his notorious ire with its exhibition of
young British artists that featured a portrait of the Virgin Mary
adorned with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement agreement, Giuliani dismissed his state
lawsuit seeking to remove the museum's board of directors and to
evict the museum from its city-owned building. The museum, in turn,
dropped its federal lawsuit, which accused Giuliani of violating
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, of course, Giuliani retained his right to call
the exhibition offensive and anti-Catholic, an ``abominable use of
public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials took the settlement more quietly. ``We're
stronger,'' said Robert S. Rubin, the chairman.

   OPEC Votes to Raise Oil Production
</P>
<P>
   After one of its most raucous meetings in years, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to pump a
modest additional amount of oil, a move that should at least slow
the recent surge in oil and gasoline prices. Iran tried to rebel,
arguing that OPEC was caving in to political pressure from the
United States. But Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest producer by
far, ultimately forced it and all the other countries to raise
their official quotas by 1.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   That probably will not lead to a big reduction in prices; Saudi
Arabia is determined to keep prices at about $25 a barrel and will
cut production if prices slip much below that.

   A Blow to Tobacco
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers had long relied on package warning labels as a
defense from lawsuits by smokers who claimed they were not told
about tobacco hazards. But a San Francisco jury ordered two
manufacturers to pay a total of $20 million in punitive damages to
a California woman who began smoking after strong warning labels
appeared in 1969.

   No New Syria-Israel Talks
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sat down with President Hafez Assad of Syria
in an effort to restart the Syrian-Israeli peace talks that broke
off in January. The effort failed, leaving it an open question when
the talks might resume.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was carrying proposals from Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel, but none of his own, when he and the Syrian leader met for
three hours in Geneva as Clinton was returning from a six-day tour
of South Asia.

   Stealing Each Other's Thunder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One major-party presidential candidate proposed a
multibillion-dollar package of education reforms last week. The
other asserted that a 6-year-old Cuban boy, rescued offshore
Florida, should be made a permanent resident of the United States
and his father should be lured to the United States with a similar
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Which candidate was the Democrat, and which the Republican?
</P>
<P>
   At this early juncture of the general election campaign, Gov.
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
nominees, are staking claims to positions that belie political
stereotypes. It was the Republican, Bush, who sought to make a
traditional Democratic issue, education, his own, by unveiling an
education plan that included a $5-billion proposal to fight
childhood illiteracy and a five-year, $2.9 billion initiative to
improve teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the Democrat, Gore, who, backing away from the
Clinton administration on one of the most politically sensitive
issues of the year, announced his belief that Elian Gonzalez should
be granted permanent residency status in the United States and that
his father should be offered the same, rather than leaving a return
to Cuba as the only way to reunite them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's move so startled Democratic allies _ ``Oh my God, it's
unbelievable!'' declared one official _ that some, like Rep. Maxine
Waters of California, said that they might have to reconsider their
support for Gore. While some liberal Democrats said he was making
an irresponsible vote grab that played politics with a little boy's
emotional state, there was no denying how important those votes, in
the pivotal state of Florida, might be to him in November.
</P>
<P>
   In embracing these positions, Bush and Gore appeared to be
inching closer to each other ideologically: Gore, after all, has
also offered an education program, amounting to $115 billion in aid
over 10 years. And Bush has long been arguing that Elian's father
should leave Cuba and be with his son in the United States, rather
than having the boy sent back to Havana.
</P>
<P>
   And both found ways to demonstrate how in sync they are with the
popular Sen. John McCain. Included in Bush's education proposals,
for instance, was money for one of McCain's favored projects,
enlisting military retirees as teachers. Gore, meanwhile, announced
his desire to raise $7.1 billion as an endowment fund for the
underwriting of House and Senate races beginning in 2008, even if
he did acknowledge that he was ``an imperfect messenger'' for
campaign finance reform.

   The Art War Guns Fall Silent &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it began last fall, it was the political equivalent of holy
war. New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denounced the Brooklyn
Museum of Art's ``Sensation'' exhibit as sacrilege. The museum's
defenders denounced the mayor as an enemy of freedom. The mayor cut
off the museum's funding. The museum took the city to federal
court. For a while it looked as if neither would ever bend.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. This is New York, where politics (almost) always bends to
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Giuliani agreed to abandon his campaign against the
museum, which had provoked his notorious ire with its exhibition of
young British artists that featured a portrait of the Virgin Mary
adorned with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   Under a settlement agreement, Giuliani dismissed his state
lawsuit seeking to remove the museum's board of directors and to
evict the museum from its city-owned building. The museum, in turn,
dropped its federal lawsuit, which accused Giuliani of violating
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, of course, Giuliani retained his right to call
the exhibition offensive and anti-Catholic, an ``abominable use of
public funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials took the settlement more quietly. ``We're
stronger,'' said Robert S. Rubin, the chairman.

   OPEC Votes to Raise Oil Production
</P>
<P>
   After one of its most raucous meetings in years, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to pump a
modest additional amount of oil, a move that should at least slow
the recent surge in oil and gasoline prices. Iran tried to rebel,
arguing that OPEC was caving in to political pressure from the
United States. But Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest producer by
far, ultimately forced it and all the other countries to raise
their official quotas by 1.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   That probably will not lead to a big reduction in prices; Saudi
Arabia is determined to keep prices at about $25 a barrel and will
cut production if prices slip much below that.

   A Blow to Tobacco
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette makers had long relied on package warning labels as a
defense from lawsuits by smokers who claimed they were not told
about tobacco hazards. But a San Francisco jury ordered two
manufacturers to pay a total of $20 million in punitive damages to
a California woman who began smoking after strong warning labels
appeared in 1969.

   No New Syria-Israel Talks
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sat down with President Hafez Assad of Syria
in an effort to restart the Syrian-Israeli peace talks that broke
off in January. The effort failed, leaving it an open question when
the talks might resume.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was carrying proposals from Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel, but none of his own, when he and the Syrian leader met for
three hours in Geneva as Clinton was returning from a six-day tour
of South Asia.

   A Film Triumph Is Born
</P>
<P>
   What began as one of the tightest and least predictable Oscar
races in years ended up as a fairly predictable love fest for
``American Beauty,'' a comedy about suburban dysfunction that
quietly grew in the weeks since the nominations were announced to
become the obvious favorite. The film won awards for best picture,
Kevin Spacey's lead performance, for the first-time director Sam
Mendes, for the veteran cinematographer Conrad L. Hall and for the
first-time screenwriter Alan Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought it would also win best actress for Annette Bening,
but that award went to a relative newcomer, Hilary Swank, for her
widely praised performance in ``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The film that was expected to give ``American Beauty'' its
biggest competition, Lasse Hallstrom's ``The Cider House Rules,''
came away with two awards for Michael Caine's supporting
performance and for John Irving's adapted screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider,'' which came into the awards with seven
nominations, and ``The Sixth Sense,'' which came in with six, both
went home empty-handed.

   Agent Orange Link Suggested
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon came closer to acknowledging what some Vietnam
veterans have alleged for years: that they were made sick by
exposure to Agent Orange, a herbicide used to destroy the forest
camouflage of the Vietnamese communists.
</P>
<P>
   A new Air Force study showed that airmen involved in the aerial
spraying operation were far more likely to suffer from diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   While the Air Force described evidence of a link as
``particularly strong,'' some scientists said it was too early to
draw conclusions.

   Failure Is Reported For Clean Air Act
</P>
<P>
   When Congress enacted amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990,
environmentalists hailed them as powerful weapons in the fight to
reduce acid rain. But a new federal report showed that many lakes,
ponds and streams in the Northeast, particularly in the Adirondack
Mountains, are continuing to turn acidic and are in increasing
danger of becoming lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that even tougher restrictions on nitrogen
emissions from upwind power plants may be needed to stem to trend.

   Putin Gets the Votes To Take Charge of Russia
</P>
<P>
   When the votes were counted from the balloting Sunday, Vladimir
Putin, who has been acting president since Boris Yeltsin resigned
the presidency on New Year's Eve, had won a narrow majority and
gained outright victory to become Russia's next democratically
elected president. Meanwhile, he remains in the office of acting
president, laying the groundwork for his new administration. He
lost no time in that role, telling his new cabinet on Monday that
it now needed to put all its work into presenting the country with
one comprehensive economic blueprint by the time he is sworn in in
May.

   Reform Rabbis Approve Gay Union Ceremonies
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis in Judaism's Reform movement who decide to officiate at
gay unions will now do with the full support of the movement's
rabbinic organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Conference of American Rabbis voted Wednesday to
declare same-sex unions among Jews ``worthy of affirmation''
through Jewish ritual. It became the largest clergy body to take
such a stand.
</P>
<P>
   The type of ritual is left up to individual rabbis, and those
who chose not officiate will also have the conference's support.

   Rising Death Toll in Uganda
</P>
<P>
   The death toll in Uganda rose day after day, as investigators
turned from a theory of mass suicide to mass murder, one of the
largest in history.
</P>
<P>
   In all, at least 725 bodies have been unearthed at four sites,
all members of a doomsday cult called the Movement for the
Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God. Many were strangled.
But many show no wounds, which investigators say may suggest
poison.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries may not be over: the nation's president, Yoweri
Museveni, said he feared the final count could reach 5,000, which
appears to have been the cult's membership.

THE U.S. ARMED FORCES SOFTEN THEIR TOUCH

   WASHINGTON _ Every few weeks, it seems, women in the U.S.
military smash through another glass ceiling. In December 1998,
female pilots flew into combat against Iraq for the first time from
the deck of an aircraft carrier. This week, in another first, a
woman is commanding a warship on its way to a combat zone in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pentagon, these milestones _ and the relative
nonchalance that accompany them _ are unequivocal signs of the
progress made over the last decade in improving the standing of
women in the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Are they really?
</P>
<P>
   A provocative new book, ``The Kinder, Gentler Military''
(Scribner), challenges the sanguine image the Pentagon would like
to convey of equality in the military's increasing co-ed ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Stephanie Gutmann, accuses the Pentagon's civilian
and military leaders of dangerously eroding U.S. militaty power in
a politically correct pursuit to expand women's opportunities. She
even suggests that the forced integration of men and women has
contributed to some of the sexual scandals that have buffeted the
services in recent years. Just last week, it was revealed that the
Army's highest-ranking woman, Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, one of
only three three-star officers in the military, had filed a sexual
harassment complaint against another Army general, accusing him of
groping her in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gutmann, a journalist who often writes about sexual politics,
argues that what sounds great in theory _ equality _ fails when put
into practice in the unique world of military service. The efforts
Pentagon brass have made to integrate women have backfired, she
asserts, causing an erosion of standards and a weakening of the
overtly testosterone-laced mentality she and others believe is
essential to the act of killing other human beings in combat.
</P>
<P>
   To support her thesis, Gutmann dissects the Pentagon's policies
and exposes some of the more extreme efforts to weed out sexist
language or discriminatory practices. At the Army's boot camp for
men and women in Ft. Jackson, S.C., female recruits no longer have
to throw a hand grenade far enough to keep from killing themselves,
and they are allowed to run more slowly in ``ability groups''
rather than keep up with the pack. For a time, young women (and
men) at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center could hold up blue
cards when the stress of training became too much.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the women not driven to physical and mental
extremes, Gutmann contends, but the men are inevitably pushed less
as a result, leaving them unprepared for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Has the military really lowered its standards to accommodate
women? In short, yes, but the full answer is far more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Men headed into Army and Marine ground combat units, which
exclude women, still train at places like Fort Benning, Ga., and
Parris Island, S.C., without the distractions that Gutmann derides.
</P>
<P>
   At other bases, Pentagon officials acknowledge that the rigors
of boot camp are not what they once were, in part out of concern
that the physical stress is more punishing on women's bodies. ``The
presence of women causes us to ask why we do some things,'' said
Richard Danzig, the secretary of the Navy. That has meant changing
everything from the number of situps to the designs of ships.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other leaders also point out that the nature of
military service and warfare has changed. The Air Force, the most
technically focused service, has been putting male and female
enlistees through basic training together at Lackland Air Force
Base in San Antonio, Texas, for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   As technology has advanced, brute force has become less and less
a priority. In these days of cruise-missile strikes and long-range
bombing, the distinctions between what men and women are asked to
do is blurring. Women can fly any Air Force or Navy warplane that
men do. During NATO's bombing in Kosovo, women flew combat raids
over Serbia while the overwhelmingly male ground combat forces sat
out the campaign in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The muscle we use in combat today is between our ears,'' said
Capt. Barbara L. Brehm of the Navy, the military director of the
Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, though, some experts have warned that the
military is growing dangerously out of touch with society's values.
Others have argued that the Pentagon's warrior culture remains
hostile to women, as well as to gays, even as these groups make
strides in civilian society.
</P>
<P>
   Women in uniform say they have long had to endure unwanted
sexual attention, but for a woman of Gen. Kennedy's rank to have
filed a formal complaint suggests that the Pentagon still has a
long way to go to create a comfortable climate for the nearly
200,000 women in the armed services, who make up 14 percent of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   To Gutmann and many in uniform, however, there should be limits
to society's influence on the armed forces. After all, they argue,
the military has the unique responsibility to train people to fight
and die in war. Gutmann's basic question is whether the nation
really wants its fighting forces to look like the rest of
couch-potato America. ``Why shouldn't the military be like the
monastery on the hill?'' she asked in an interview. ``Why shouldn't
it be the institution that is part of us, but still different?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there is one thing people on both sides of the
argument agree on. And it was best expressed by none other than
Gen. Kennedy, whom Gutmann quotes in her book. ``This is not your
father's Army anymore,'' the general told cadets at West Point a
few years ago.

   To Gutmann and many in uniform, however, there should be limits
to society's influence on the armed forces. After all, they argue,
the military has the unique responsibility to train people to fight
and die in war. Gutmann's basic question is whether the nation
really wants its fighting forces to look like the rest of
couch-potato America. ``Why shouldn't the military be like the
monastery on the hill?'' she asked in an interview. ``Why shouldn't
it be the institution that is part of us, but still different?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there is one thing people on both sides of the
argument agree on. And it was best expressed by none other than
Gen. Kennedy, whom Gutmann quotes in her book. ``This is not your
father's Army anymore,'' the general told cadets at West Point a
few years ago.

THE JOY, THE CHAGRIN: SEX BECAME HIM

   Dr. Alex Comfort, who died on March 26, personified the sort of
tweedy English intellectual who could gracefully range from subject
to subject. He was a physician, poet, novelist, anarchist, pacifist
and a leading researcher on how people age.
</P>
<P>
   But to millions of people around the world, Comfort, who was 80,
will be remembered only for his book, ``The Joy of Sex: A Gourmet
Guide to Lovemaking'' (Crown, 1972). To his considerable chagrin,
his 50 other books, ranging from medical textbooks to metaphysical
poetry, were totally eclipsed by the graphically illustrated sex
book he knocked out in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Burgess may have compared his intellect with Machiavelli
and Voltaire, but Comfort rued that he would never escape the
``albatross'' of his $3 million best seller. He feared he would
forever be Dr. Sex.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at his oeuvre, however, reveals a multifaceted mind. In
his 1945 novel, ``The Power House'' (Viking Press), he argues for
life over abstract ideas:
</P>
<P>
   ``The lunatics either desire you or fear you, and I do not know
which kills you more rapidly. Banners are waved in your face, guns
are thrust in your ribs, grinning flat-footed gangs of citizens,
all mouthing the same bilge, push you and threaten to educate you
by cutting your throat. People ask, what is the use of life to a
slave? That's bilge _ what's the use of freedom to a corpse?''
</P>
<P>
   His 1948 essay, ``The Novel and Our Time'' (Alan Swallow),
advanced the theory that writers use their art as a means of
liberation. The writer, he said, ``does not learn to write so that
he can `write,' but because without the necessary tools he cannot
dig his way out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   His 1949 novel, ``On This Side of Nothing'' (Viking), addressed
the meaning of being a Jew: ``There was something unnatural in his
assumption that the ghetto would shelter him _ he was taking a good
deal too much for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had reached some conclusions of my own before that in
the earliest weeks of the siege, that Jews are not born, but made;
that everyone who runs, who disobeys, who prefers living to
obeying, is a Jew. Doesn't he carry his ghetto around with him, in
every country, at every time?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Comfort wrote ``Darwin and the Naked Lady'' (George
Braziller). He considered the relationship between Darwin and
Freud. ``Freud has had the greater effect on our understanding of
behavior, aesthetic behavior in particular, but Darwin provides the
groundwork for the understanding of Freud. We had better,
therefore, take them together.''
</P>
<P>
   As shown in his 1966 book, ``The Nature of Human Nature''
(Harper &AMP; Row), he did not believe in sugarcoating hard truths. ``
`Hell,' said a Sartre character, `is other people.' It can also be
ourselves. Man is the only animal which is inherently able,
corporately and individually, to be his own worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally dark was his view of old age, as presented in ``A Good
Age'' (Crown, 1976). At retirement age, he commented that people
are ``rendered unemployed, useless and, in some cases,
impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that transition, and in proportion to their
chronological age, they are prescribed to be unintelligent,
unemployable, crazy and asexual.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Sex? ``In the days of formal dancing one used to wish
that the girl had her breasts on her back where one could reach
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dr. Alex Comfort was more than that.

LEGAL MINDS AT WORK: DEFINING NUDITY ON A FIRST AMENDMENT
BATTLEFIELD

<P>
   When the Supreme Court upheld an ordinance last week banning
nude dancing in Erie, Pa., the American public was treated to the
spectacle of hearing Justice Sandra Day O'Connor somberly discuss
the protective qualities of pasties and G-strings, which the law
requires dancers to wear.
</P>
<P>
   The court has tackled such matters before. In 1991 the justices
upheld an Indiana public indecency law that also banned nude
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   And four years ago, in a case involving a similar statute in St.
John's County, Fla., the court refused to overturn lower-court
decisions that rejected the argument that the ban violated erotic
dancers' freedom of artistic expression.
</P>
<P>
   That case also provided an unusual insight into the legal mind
at work. It turns out the St. John's County law, which requires
that about one-third of a dancer's buttocks be covered, went to
great lengths _ 328 words, to be exact _ to define that unlikely
battleground for First Amendment rights:
</P>
<P>
   ``The area at the rear of the human body (sometimes referred to
as the glutaeus maximus) which lies between two imaginary lines
running parallel to the ground when a person is standing, the first
or top of such line being one-half inch below the top of the
vertical cleavage of the nates (i.e., the prominence formed by the
muscles running from the back of the hip to the back of the leg)
and the second or bottom line being one-half inch above the lowest
point of the curvature of the fleshy protuberance (sometimes
referred to as the gluteal fold), and between two imaginary lines,
one on each side of the body (the `outside lines'), which outside
lines are perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines
described above and which perpendicular outside lines pass through
the outermost point(s) at which each nate meets the outer side of
each leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothwithstanding the above, buttocks shall not include the
leg, the hamstring muscle below the gluteal fold, the tensor
fasciae latae muscle or any of the above-described portion of the
human body that is between either the left inside perpendicular
line and the left outside perpendicular line or the right inside
perpendicular line and the right outside perpendicular line. For
the purpose of the previous sentence the left inside perpendicular
line shall be an imaginary line on the left side of the anus that
is perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines
described above and that is one-third the distance from the anus to
the left outside line, and the right inside perpendicular line
shall be an imaginary line on the right side of the anus that is
perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines described
above and that is one-third of the distance from the anus to the
right outside line. (The above description can generally be
described as covering one-third of the buttocks centered over the
cleavage for the length of the cleavage.)''

THE LOST PROMISE OF SCHOOL INTEGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

 By JEFFREY ROSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, nearly half a century after the Supreme Court ruled that
school segregation was unconstitutional, are efforts to achieve
racially integrated public schools legally and politically doomed?
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court let stand a decision by a
federal appeals court, which held that school authorities in
Montgomery County, Md., violated the Constitution when they tried
to prevent a white student from transferring to a magnet school
from his neighborhood elementary school, which is predominantly
black.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County case is only the latest in a series of
decisions, going back several years, that are making it hard for
public schools to maintain even a semblance of racial diversity in
a judicial and political climate that exalts choice above all other
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't reconcile choice with diversity, and that's the
tragedy,'' says Samuel Issacharoff of Columbia Law School, a
leading scholar of desegregation. ``Fifty years after Brown vs.
Board of Education, there is still no non-coercive mechanism for
racial integration that has evolved in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   That unanimous 1954 Supreme Court decision became famous for the
phrase, ``Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.''
Less well-remembered is the opinion's insistence that education
itself is ``the very foundation of good citizenship ... the
principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values.''
</P>
<P>
   In the court's view, educating children of different races
together was key to the crucial project of creating a society less
divided by race. But the era when courts were willing to force
integration through mandatory busing ended in the mid-1990s. Now,
judges and parents are questioning the constitutionality and value
of programs that try to create racially balanced schools without
busing, by restricting who can go to school where. Indeed, based on
a pattern of rulings in recent years, the Supreme Court may be on
the verge of holding this as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in judicial and public opinion may mean that the
central premise of the Brown decision _ that integrated public
schools are the most important institution in a pluralistic society
_ will not survive the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Montgomery County case. White enrollment at the
Glen Haven elementary school in Montgomery County dropped from 40
percent in 1995 to 24 percent in 1998, although the county as a
whole is 53 percent white. In an effort to stop the rapid decline,
the county adopted a policy that no student could transfer out of a
school if the transfer would adversely affect racial diversity,
unless he or she could prove some kind of ``unique personal
hardship.'' In striking down this policy, the 4th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., concluded that the Constitution
prohibits ``racial balancing'' from being used as the decisive
factor in school assignments.
</P>
<P>
   This is a straightforward application of years of Supreme Court
decisions restricting the use of race to distribute government
benefits. But those decisions have left surprisingly few
alternatives open to school districts that value integration. In
the early 1980s, many districts began to abandon futile efforts to
integrate neighborhood schools and instead set up magnet schools in
the hope of attracting a diverse group of applicants from the
entire school district. But using random lotteries to determine
admission to oversubscribed magnet schools often fails to produce
racial balance. For this reason, a magnet school in Arlington
County, Virginia, recently adopted a weighted lottery system,
giving preferences to minority students. Last year, the Court of
Appeals struck down the weighted lottery on the same grounds it had
invoked in the Montgomery County case: in school admissions, racial
balancing is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Academically competitive exam schools have had no more luck in
adopting explicit racial and ethnic admissions goals. In recent
cases, the Boston Latin School in Massachusetts and Lowell High
School in San Francisco, were forced to abandon their racial
admissions targets. In response, Lowell set aside 20 percent of its
class for applicants who met the minimum test score cut-off but had
suffered from socioeconomic disadvantage. This system allowed the
school to admit disadvantaged white and Asian students, but
produced few African-Americans and Hispanics. The handful of
successful efforts to achieve integration in school districts as a
whole are now in legal jeopardy. Cambridge, Mass., has designed a
program called ``controlled choice,'' in which all schools are open
to everyone regardless of where they live, and parents rank the
schools in order of preference. But each school must have a
balanced racial mix. If the Supreme Court ultimately decides that
racial integration for its own sake can't justify race-based
admissions policies, then ``controlled choice'' programs like the
one in Cambridge may be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any school district that is doing anything around these issues
of promoting diversity is feeling vulnerable right now,'' says Amy
Stuart Wells, a professor of education at UCLA.

   In the new era, only strategies that entice parental choice,
rather than control it, can clearly pass constitutional muster. But
in an age when political support for integration is declining,
these strategies face an uphill battle. Some districts, for
example, have increased financing for inner-city schools on a
field-of-dreams theory: If you improve the schools, white students
will come. But the most visible example of this approach, in Kansas
City, was a notable failure. Under court order, the city spent
nearly $200 million to build a state-of-the-art magnet school. The
white students failed to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Choice plans that allow black parents to send their children to
white suburban schools have had similarly mixed success. Twenty
states have open enrollment laws that allow children to transfer
from district to district. But because few of these states provide
for subsidized transportation to the suburbs, many black parents
are unable to avail themselves of the opportunity. St. Louis, by
contrast, was forced by court order to provide subsidized
transportation for children from the inner city to attend 16
suburban school districts. Thirteen thousand children have accepted
the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents make their decisions on the basis not of ideology but
on whatever they think will advance the education of their
children, and they will choose desegregation whenever it's a viable
option,'' says William Taylor, a veteran desegregation attorney who
represented the plaintiffs in the St. Louis case.
</P>
<P>
   The experience in St. Louis shows that money is necessary to
allow poor parents the same opportunities to escape failing inner
city schools as richer parents enjoy. This, perhaps, accounts for
the growing support among minorities for school vouchers. Professor
Jay Greene of the University of Texas at Austin contends that in
cities that have adopted voucher programs, the voucher schools tend
to be more racially integrated than the public schools. Nearly a
fifth of voucher recipients in Cleveland attend private schools
that reflect the racial composition of the city as a whole, Greene
notes, while only 5.2 percent of Cleveland public school students
are in comparably integrated schools.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, a strong supporter of vouchers, has
become the leading national advocate for the view that racial
diversity is ultimately less important than ensuring a genuinely
equal education for African-American children. ``It never ceases to
amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything
that is predominantly black must be inferior,'' Thomas wrote in a
1995 decision criticizing the district court's decision to convert
Kansas City into a magnet district.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to choose between racial diversity and educational
quality, most African-American parents seem to agree with Thomas.
In a 1998 survey of 800 white parents and 800 black parents
conducted by Public Agenda, 82 percent of the black parents said
that raising academic standards was more important than achieving
more diversity and integration.
</P>
<P>
   These overwhelming numbers do not, however, capture the full
complexity and ambivalence of the views of white and black parents
about the value of integration. In the same poll, 80 percent of
black parents and 66 percent of white parents said it was ``very
important'' or ``somewhat important'' to them that their own
children attend an integrated school. Only those without the means
to choose an education that is both integrated and adequate are
willing to settle for quality.
</P>
<P>
   With idealism that, in retrospect, seems poignant, the Brown
decision assumed that the removal of state-enforced segregation
would be enough to integrate schools around the country. In the
North and the South, that view proved to be naive and untenable.
But now that legal and political tolerance for even mildly coercive
forms of integration appears to be evaporating, the hope of
integrated public schools may soon be a distant memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the final frontier,'' says David Goldberg of the NAACP
Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``If the Supreme Court decides
that there's no compelling interest in educational diversity, then
the basic premise of Brown will have been repudiated.''

   NEW YORK _ Never underestimate the power of Abby Joseph Cohen.
Last week, a warning about stock prices from Cohen, the formidable
chief investment strategist for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
singlehandedly caused a broad sell-off in markets worldwide. It
left even the most seasoned traders quivering. ``When she speaks,
markets move,'' one marveled to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   And not just markets. While Cohen has been ubiquitous on Wall
Street, the rest of the world is badly in need of her guidance. But
all that just might change in the months to come if Cohen expands
her spheres of influence. Here's a scenario as played out in a
series of news items:
</P>
<P>
   April 20, 2000 _ Steven Spielberg surprised Hollywood today when
he announced he was dropping plans to develop ``Minority Report,''
a science-fiction thriller set to star Tom Cruise, after the
Goldman, Sachs stock market seer Abby Joseph Cohen told Spielberg
that she believed the highly anticipated film would be a flop. ``I
thought we had a solid script, and Tom is usually bankable,'' he
said, ``but I couldn't take a chance after Abby gave the project a
thumbs down.'' An obviously disappointed Spielberg said, ``I'm
hoping she likes the sequel to `Saving Private Ryan' better.''
</P>
<P>
   May 15, 2000 _ Teen pregnancy rates dropped by nearly one-third
in 1999, to the lowest level in four decades, federal health
officials said yesterday. The National Center for Health Statistics
attributed the encouraging trend, which spanned all racial and
ethnic groups, to the ``Abby Says No'' teen abstinence campaign
featuring the stock market strategist Abby Joseph Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody touches kids like Abby,'' said Donna E. Shalala,
secretary of health and human services. ``Not Britney Spears, not
the Backstreet Boys, no one. She's been so right on the market for
so long that she has what the kids call `cred,' and you can't fake
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy, has asked Cohen for the chance to
expand ``Abby Says No'' to its anti-drug campaigns. ``Let's be
honest, those ads with the heroin addicts are getting old,'' said
General McCaffrey. ``We're looking for something a little more
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   July 20, 2000 _ Abby Joseph Cohen took home the top prize at the
World Series of Poker yesterday, winning $1.1 million after
defeating a field of more than 400 of the world's best poker
players. Cohen vanquished her final opponent, poker veteran Huck
Seed, with an ace-high flush, topping Seed's straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no chance,'' he said. ``It was like she could read my
mind!'' The always-modest Cohen attributed her victory mainly to
luck and said she had never played poker before entering the
tournament. ``I signed up mainly because I always wanted to see Las
Vegas,'' Cohen said. ``It's pretty neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 5, 2000 _ ``China and Taiwan will announce today that they
have ended more than a half-century of hostility and agreed in
principle to reunify as one nation by the end of the year, sources
close to the talks said late last night. The shocking deal comes
only days after Goldman, Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen quietly
offered top Chinese and Taiwanese officials a white paper that
predicted stock markets in both countries could fall as much as 90
percent in the event of a Chinese attempt to take Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abby found the issue that resonates with the leaders of both
sides when she showed them just how much money a war would cost
them,'' said one American diplomat about the talks, which are being
held at Goldman, Sachs headquarters in New York City. ``She
deserves the Nobel Prize for this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 8, 2000 _ New York voters soundly rejected both New York
City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton yesterday, instead choosing Abby Joseph Cohen as New York's
newest senator. With 98 percent of precincts reporting late
Tuesday, Cohen, whose name was not listed on the ballot and who did
not campaign, had more than 63 percent of the vote, while Giuliani
and Clinton were locked in a virtual dead heat for second place
with 18 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   After word of Cohen's unexpected triumph was announced
yesterday, New Yorkers statewide rushed into the streets to
rejoice, creating an impromptu block party that stretched from
Buffalo to Montauk. ``I'm so glad it's Abby,'' said Gov. George E.
Pataki of Albany. ``Hillary and Rudy, Rudy and Hillary _ you've
gotta be kidding.''

 &HT;    Brewski bill a faint hope for beer snobs
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I'm no beer snob but ... Oh, why start off
with a lie? I am a beer snob and it's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Other kinds of snobbery give you social standing, opportunities
to bully lesser men, but beer snobbery? It gets you no further than
video-game snobbery. (''I won't buy Tomb Raider V. They ruined
Laura Croft's purity of line.'')
</P>
<P>
   This is not an easy vice to pursue. You suffer the effects of
pretentiousness without the advantages. At parties, you are
discovered systematically rifling the cooler until you find
something, anything, with a long neck, maybe a foil wrapper and
certainly without a twist-off cap.
</P>
<P>
   In stores, you scan the shelves for labels with 19th-century
style lettering and Victorian dingbats on the labels _ sure hints
the liquid within may be dark and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   You can't go to the corner convenience store for lottery tickets
and a six-pack of Ye Olde Oat and Crankshaft Extra-Heavy Cream
Stout. (''You know it's the real thing because there's stuff
floating in it.'') People make fun of you for trying to order it in
public. And even the Florida Legislature works against you.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the Legislature. It suppresses the sale of obscure
beers in the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   How? Well, since 1965, Florida has required that beer be sold in
only four sizes of bottles or cans _ 8 ounces, 12 ounces, 16 ounces
or 32 ounces. That's it. Because the rest of the world uses the
metric system, this has the effect of banning foreign beers from
</P>
<P>
   Florida unless they are specially packaged for the Florida
market.
</P>
<P>
   Big brewers and wholesalers like this arrangement. It keeps
pesky, small brewers out of the state and restricts foreign beers
lest they corrupt the palates of Florida's beer drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Good, old-fashioned protectionism served cold.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's beer wholesalers won't come out and say they support
the law because it limits competition. That would be un-American.
Instead, they make their campaign donations and talk about the
pernicious effects if consumers were faced with too many choices.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Morroni (R-Clearwater), chairman of the House
Regulated Industries Committee, says he is leaning against a bill
that would finally end this nonsense and allow stores to stock any
size beer bottle under 32 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   He says feels this way because ``it would allow larger beer
sizes on college campuses.'' Another factor might be $1,000 in
donations he received last election from the Florida Beer
Wholesalers' ``good government'' fund.
</P>
<P>
   As serious as the problem of college alcohol abuse is, I don't
think small bottles are a deterrent. Many students have figured out
that if they can't get drunk on one bottle of beer, they can buy
more than one bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Those college kids can be very, very clever.
</P>
<P>
   Beer wholesaler lobbyists argue that more choices on the shelf
would ``confuse consumers'' and force stores to waste money
stocking a greater variety of beers in different sized bottles.

 &HT;    Reading about the Light Party makes you want to drink a beer
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ When I first looked at the brouchure for the
Light Party, I wasn't sure if I was reading about a political
movement or a place I could go to get drunk on low-calorie beer.
</P>
<P>
   I've decided that it was, in a sense, about both things, a
political party that is less filling and tastes great.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure says the party is a synthesis of the Republican,
Democratic, Libertarian and Green Parties ``a proactive, wholistic,
education, empowerment party.''
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   So I can see right away where the Democrats, Libertarians and
Greens come in (goofy, wacky and weird), but I had to read a little
further to figure out the Republican connection.
</P>
<P>
   Aha! You have to pay $33 to join.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for that money, you get the party's comprehensive
networking and resource guide, the human ecology program and an
Artainment music video. Wow. Not only are these guys part
Republicans, they are part televangelists, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Light Party was founded by a fellow who calls himself Da
Vid, M.D. If you're like me, you did a quick check to make sure he
wasn't on the list of doctors affiliated with your HMO.
</P>
<P>
   You can actually find a long (he calls it brief, but trust me,
it is long) biography of Da Vid on the Internet. The operative
sentence in all of it is this:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer of 1972 a transformative event of the first
magnitude took place for me _ an event that forever changed my life
... I took my my first LSD trip _ and what a trip it was!''
</P>
<P>
   At least with Da Vid, who is a candidate for president, we don't
have to worry about whether he inhaled or not. The question is: Did
he ever exhale?
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps you wonder what the Lights want other than free love
beads for everyone. For one thing, they believe in an amendment for
national initiative and referendum, which is a Libertarian idea.
They also believe in global peace and health, though when I went to
see how Da Vid wants to bring about this health, there is no real
idea, just about 2,000 Internet links.
</P>
<P>
   A clearer clue to what the Lights are all about comes in their
19 political action alerts.
</P>
<P>
   It probably will come as no surprise to you that Da Vid and the
gang are keenly interested in stopping the war on drugs. When it
does end, they are gonna have a heck of a victory party.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more interesting ideas, they promoted Jan. 1,
2000, as a day without any violence in any prison on Earth _ no
fights, no stabbings, no incidents of any kind. Hmmm, I wonder if
it worked?
</P>
<P>
   When you get to the part where it says how you could help
achieve this, the first item is ``SEND MONEY.'' (There goes that
Republican/televangelist connection again). I suppose maybe we
could have bribed all the criminals on Earth to play nice for one
day.
</P>
<P>
   The party's other hot points include gun control, opposition to
the death penalty, saving the rain forest, banning all nuclear
weapons and freeing Leonard Peltier.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite plank in the Light platform _ oops, better not call
them planks, they don't believe in cutting down trees _ is the Save
the Whales program.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't just saving the whales as in keeping them from
being harpooned by fishermen, this is Save the Whales from Low
Frequency Active Sonar. We want to make sure the whales don't get a
headache.
</P>
<P>
   At the Light Party Web site, they have a long section on
prophecy which I'm assuming Da Vid came about during one of his
wonderful experiences with LSD. Again, one sentence will be enough:
</P>
<P>
   ``In another grand astronomical event, our whole solar system is
intersecting a photon belt (zone of light and higher consciousness)

 &HT;    Ban on flag burning would dissolve rights for which founders
fought
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Given a choice, few Americans would live in a
country where people were arrested for expressing opinions banned
by the government.
</P>
<P>
   This nation's guaranteed individual liberties have limited the
number of citizens who support the police-state practices of
governments operated by dictators, communists or fascists.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, one of America's greatest strengths has been
the freedom of its citizens to express their opinions on any
subject, no matter how odious those opinions may be to government
officials or other citizens.
</P>
<P>
   This freedom was granted to Americans by the nation's founders
who waged a long and bitter war to overthrow a government that
arrested citizens who dared express banned opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The Founding Fathers knew exactly what they were doing when they
prominently included certain individual freedoms in the Bill of
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress shall make no law,'' wrote James Madison, that
abridges the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the
freedom of citizens to practice their chosen religions or other
listed and implied freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   These hard-won individual freedoms, often taken for granted by
citizens today, were upfront and personal to the men and women who
suffered under a government that criminalized unapproved speech,
religion or publications.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, these individual freedoms have been
responsible for launching and maintaining the world's
longest-running and freest democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens cannot be truly free unless they can express opinions
in opposition to the government and its symbols without fear of
arrest or punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, for the fourth time in 11 years, Congress members
have attempted to ban a form of speech they don't like. That's a
shame.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how ugly the speech, it's far worse for Congress to
make a law that abridges the public's free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Constitution forbids Congress from making laws that
abridge constitutional rights, Congress members are trying to
change the U.S. Constitution with an amendment that allows them to
ban burning the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that burning the national flag is an
expression of speech. It is a repulsive form of speech for
Americans who believe in the freedoms and principles of this
nation. Nevertheless, it's still speech.
</P>
<P>
   If flag burning were not speech, there would be no need to pass
a constitutional amendment that gives Congress the right to pass a
law that abridges speech.
</P>
<P>
   Flag burning is rare. When it is done, the perpetrators are
making a statement that expresses their opinion about this nation.
The U.S. Supreme Court has twice held flag burning as protected
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, burning the flag is not what outrages so many
Americans, even though there were only 45 documented cases of
malicious flag burning between 1777 and 1989. Burning is the
accepted method for disposing of the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress and the American public ever passed a constitutional
amendment that outlawed desecration of the American flag, the
government would have to determine what the flag-burner was
thinking and what message he intended to communicate when he put
the match to the flag.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of having government thought-police arresting citizens
for expressing unacceptable opinions would be a grievous erosion of
this nation's freedoms. It would make America's founders heartsick.
</P>
<P>
   The flag is a symbol of this nation's freedoms. Abridging those
freedoms to protect the symbol weakens the symbol. In other words,
it desecrates the flag.

 &HT;    Idiomatic or idiot speech?
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ This morning, by popular demand and in
accordance with Village Ordinance 2791-3 (enacted to keep ugliness
off the streets), I went to the beauty parlor. It was a bust.
</P>
<P>
   The hair came out okay, but it made the rest of me look bad. I
keep telling Karen it must be the lights. I've begged her to ditch
the daylight fluorescents and screw in some of those nice pink
bulbs _ the ones that softly shave 10 years off the face in the
mirror. She says if she did that, hair colors in our town would
turn freaky _ fast.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, conversation helps to divert my attention from the
mirror, but I'm not big on talking with hair in my mouth. That's
why it's almost impossible not to overhear nearby chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he goes, like, ``Wow! That dress is like, blue!'' and I go
like, ``So? Yeah'' and he goes, ``Take it back.''
</P>
<P>
   What was passing for conversation in the next booth, was
interfering with my concentration on an article explaining the
problem of presidential candidates and soft money. Worst of all,
the person on the other end of that babble responds, ``Really?''
which encourages the monosyllabic raconteur.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I go, like, a ``You stupid or something? What do you hate
about blue?'' and he gets all crazy like I'm badmouthing his mother
or something, ya know?'' The operator says she fully understands _
which puts her way ahead of me.
</P>
<P>
   Idiomatic speech based on geography, is nothing new. I've lived
in many places and actually come to enjoy and understand much of
it. But this is different.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, I met storytellers with a rapid-fire, third-person
delivery I've never heard anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Sez him, ``Get away from my sister.'' Sez me, ``Your old lady
chews!'' Sez him, ``Who ya yellin at monkeymouth?''
</P>
<P>
   When I moved to Georgia, back to the land of the soft drawl of
my southern coastal ancestors, I thought I'd have no trouble
speaking like a native. I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He-eeey, Libuth,'' friendly souls would greet me on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howsyermommerenem?'' I remember spending a lot of time
standing in front of the hardware store looking stupid and
grinning, which I imagine left some folks with the impression I was
on heavy medication.
</P>
<P>
   One day the florist lady noted my confusion and explained.
``They're asking about your health. What they're saying is, 'Hi,
Elizabeth. How is your mother and all the rest of your family?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Then she taught me an answer: ``Jessfinethankeehowboutyessef?''
which translates to: I and mine are well, thank you, and how about
yours?
</P>
<P>
   The jarring voice in the next booth rattles through the lattice
partition.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm like, ``It's just a dress,'' and he goes, ``So take it
back.'' I'm like, ``Okay.'' Then I go, ``I'll take it back.'' Like
I don't really mind taking it back cause it like...a...don't fit
good across the boozums anyway. Ya know?''
</P>
<P>
   I stick my fingers in my ears. This is not dialect. This is
laziness. This woman with the ugly blue dress and the oversize
bosom surely has to know more of the half-million English words
available to her than the handful she's using in her tedious
attempt to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``WHAT?'' I want to shout ``are you trying to say?'' But I
don't. Instead I amuse myself with thoughts of how an historical
document such as The Declaration of Independence might have read
had Thomas Jefferson had as little grasp of syntax and vocabulary
as the woman in the next booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, like, um...when in the course of ... like human events, it
like becomes necessary for one people to like a dissolve the ... a
... political bands which have like connected....? See what I mean?
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, Great Britain would never have figured out what it
was the Colonists were griping about, and Thomas and his buddies
would still be trying to find words for ``usurpation'' and
``unwarrantable jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing for sure, the lady with the ugly blue dress couldn't
have helped.

 &HT;    Zombie Revenge a raw shooting spree lacking depth
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Raw and unassuming gameplay makes Sega's Zombie Revenge ($40;
www.dreamcast.com) a near-brainless third-person romp through
innumerable levels plagued by the undead. A thin, post
apocalyptic/secret-experiment-gone-awry story stands as the premise
behind nonstop shooting of rampaging rotting corpses. Terrific
graphics and intuitive control makes for a fast-paced, auto-aiming
killing spree replete with health grabs, power-ups and various
high- and low-tech weapons of mass-dismemberment pick-ups.
Surprisingly addictive in spite of its lack of depth, Zombie
Revenge works as a tremendous stress reliever without all the
inherent guilt of amoral behavior. After all, these aren't
simulated people splooshing and splattering, glorping and gooing
all over the TV screen; they're zombies, and zombies aren't real.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Flight sim fans want tons of the eye candy but they also want
the tiny details done right. On both counts, Jane's F/A-18A
Simulator ($40 for the PC, www.ea.com) further builds the sim
maker's reputation as the real deal with what might be the best
military flight sim yet. From the instructive, fun tutorials to the
massive campaign options, from the fabulously detailed cockpit to
the lush terrain below, Jane's has focused on a single aircraft and
gotten everything right. A white-knuckle landing in bad weather on
a carrier deck is unforgettable, and with great multiplayer
options, there's very little here to criticize. The game runs great
even on a modestly powerful machine, and many options are available
to customize the difficulty settings, so that this game, crafted
with hard-core simmers in mind, is not beyond the reach of the
casual desktop pilot.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ You want to look good while listening to your
tunes. That's why you need to pick up Sony's Street Style Discman
($160, www.sony.
</P>
<P>
   com). The industrial-looking Discman is a must-have for the
trendy, on-the-go set. The device is finished in chrome and red
translucent plastic and has a carrying strap, making it the
ultimate accoutrement to a rollerblading escapade. The Street Style
Discman also comes with Street Style headphones, which wrap around
the back of the head and provide awesome sound. If you think this
portable CD player just looks good, think again. This Discman is
equipped with Sony's patented ESP2, which is some of the best skip
protection on the market. With ESP2 and the Street Style Discman,
you'll never miss a beat _ and look good in the process.

   Touted as the PlayStation's ``first Mini Wheel that rumbles as
you drive,'' Madcatz's Hand Held Racing Wheel ($35;
www.madcatz.com) combines smooth analog steering and lots of
digital action buttons in an innovative compact design and is
endorsed, of course, by Madcatz spokesman and racing legend Mario
Andretti. While the unit is terribly comfortable with its ergonomic
pistol-grip shape and side-mounted, firm and responsive little
wheel conveying healthful resistance, button configuration leaves a
little to be desired, especially for games that require/demand
simultaneous application of throttle and brake and a gear change or
three. Still, a great vibrating RC style wheel/controller for
straightforward, pedal-to-the-medal racing games such as NASCAR,
FI, Motocross or Superbike _ and it's just a peach with GT
Interactive's Driver _ but rally games just aren't attuned to this
particular design.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first test of a CD-ROM for children is
really about ease of use: Can you install it, set your child in
front of it and walk away, confident that the software will do the
rest? Unfortunately, that standard is beyond The American Girls
Dress Designer ($30 for Windows, www.mattelmedia.com) _ one of
woefully few programs aimed at pre-teen girls _ which is limited in
scope, yet difficult to use. On the positive side, the program lets
girls pick and create fabric patterns, colors and other trim for
finishing touches on clothes that can be printed out and used on
paper dolls of girls throughout American history. The artwork is of
a high standard, but our 8-year-old tester quickly got frustrated
with the program's limitations on her imagination: With too few
options toward the stated purpose of actually designing clothes,
she quickly lost interest.

A LITERARY GHOST IN THE HMO DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Given the transformation of American medicine over the last 75
years, Dr. Martin Solomon, a central figure in this Tuesday's
edition of the PBS documentary series ``Frontline,'' has little in
common with Dr. Martin Arrowsmith, the hero of Sinclair Lewis'
famous 1925 novel that bears his name. But they share a chronic
discontent: a feeling that they are trapped between the duty to
practice their profession conscientiously and the pressures of a
market society. The complaint, rooted in a clash between the
principles of Hippocrates and those of Adam Smith, may not be fully
curable.
</P>
<P>
   We meet Solomon, a primary care physician, in the prestigious
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard, where he is
examining a man being treated for a dangerous infection and heart
problems. The patient has been in the intensive care unit for more
than six weeks at a cost of $150,000 and rising. Solomon calls his
expensive case ``a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Israel is owned by CareGroup, a network of 7 hospitals,
3,000 doctors and 400,000 patients, which lost $100 million last
year. In an effort to change that, its doctors have been made
responsible for containing treatment costs and turning their
practices into profit centers. Their expenses _ ``Every time I
write a prescription, every time I order a test, every time I send
a patient to the emergency room'' _ are closely monitored, Solomon
laments, and if they spend too much, their incomes suffer.
</P>
<P>
   So there is pressure to shorten hospital stays and office
visits, reduce high-tech tests and discourage patients from seeking
consultations outside the group. And the best hospitals, like
Deaconess, which take on the most complicated cases and do research
and teaching as well, have the highest bills.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the new system is keeping doctors focused on the bottom
line, but is that where they should be? Sinclair Lewis, the son of
a country doctor, would surely have thought not, and his
Bildungsroman is largely given to the earnest young Arrowsmith's
efforts to resist the lures of the profit motive, which keep
getting in the way of the healer's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing in the 1920s, Arrowsmith does not have to worry about
the high cost of diagnostic equipment since there are precious few
of those latter-day wonders, or about reductions in federal
financing since there isn't much of that either, or about the
impositions of HMOs. . But he has plenty of experience with his
profession's greed. As a satirist, Lewis was usually heavy-handed,
but his diagnosis of social ailments could be sharp.
</P>
<P>
   One character describes a successful surgeon as ``riding up to
the hospital in a lovely car with a chauffeur in uniform, and all
his patients simply worshiping him.'' Another doctor, a specialist
in removing any tonsils within reach of his knife, advises medical
students on the value of salesmanship in dealing with a customer:
``Explain to him, also to his stricken and anxious family, the hard
work and thought you are giving to his case, and so make him feel
that the good you have done him, or intend to do him, is even
greater than the fee you plan to charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrowsmith meets still another doctor, who reasons that ``It'd
be better for the general health situation if there weren't any
public health departments at all, because they get a lot of people
into the habit of going to free clinics instead of to private
physicians, and cut down the earnings of doctors and reduce their
number, so there are less of us to keep a watchful eye on
sickness.'' And Arrowsmith discerns ``the slimy trail of the
dollar'' in a Babbitt-like doctor's opposition to pasteurizing milk
and regulating tenements for fear of offending dairymen and
landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Dated though Arrowsmith's concerns are, the members of Solomon's
medical group, whose annual incomes range from $120,000 to
$300,000, also find themselves in thrall to financial constraints
and influenced by incentives that may run contrary to a patient's
well being. For example, they are under pressure to keep patients
from seeing specialists outside of CareGroup lest it reduce their
income. A doctor at another Boston HMO speaks for his patients:
``Are you really serving my best interest as a patient, doctor, or,
in fact, are you looking out for your best interest?''
</P>
<P>
   As the nation struggles to work out rational, compassionate,
economic health-care arrangements, the ethical issues faced by
Arrowsmith and those facing Solomon are not all that different. The
defiant Martin Arrowsmith ends up doing honest research of his own,
freed at last of the opportunism and corruption of the
practitioners around him. When last heard from, Martin Solomon is
explaining how he now must resist sending a patient to another
doctor even if he knows it might be to her benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that is a good system, Solomon answers, ``I think
it stinks.''

   So there is pressure to shorten hospital stays and office
visits, reduce high-tech tests and discourage patients from seeking
consultations outside the group. And the best hospitals, like
Deaconess, which take on the most complicated cases and do research
and teaching as well, have the highest bills.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the new system is keeping doctors focused on the bottom
line, but is that where they should be? Sinclair Lewis, the son of
a country doctor, would surely have thought not, and his
Bildungsroman is largely given to the earnest young Arrowsmith's
efforts to resist the lures of the profit motive, which keep
getting in the way of the healer's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing in the 1920s, Arrowsmith does not have to worry about
the high cost of diagnostic equipment since there are precious few
of those latter-day wonders, or about reductions in federal
financing since there isn't much of that either, or about the
impositions of HMOs. . But he has plenty of experience with his
profession's greed. As a satirist, Lewis was usually heavy-handed,
but his diagnosis of social ailments could be sharp.
</P>
<P>
   One character describes a successful surgeon as ``riding up to
the hospital in a lovely car with a chauffeur in uniform, and all
his patients simply worshiping him.'' Another doctor, a specialist
in removing any tonsils within reach of his knife, advises medical
students on the value of salesmanship in dealing with a customer:
``Explain to him, also to his stricken and anxious family, the hard
work and thought you are giving to his case, and so make him feel
that the good you have done him, or intend to do him, is even
greater than the fee you plan to charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrowsmith meets still another doctor, who reasons that ``It'd
be better for the general health situation if there weren't any
public health departments at all, because they get a lot of people
into the habit of going to free clinics instead of to private
physicians, and cut down the earnings of doctors and reduce their
number, so there are less of us to keep a watchful eye on
sickness.'' And Arrowsmith discerns ``the slimy trail of the
dollar'' in a Babbitt-like doctor's opposition to pasteurizing milk
and regulating tenements for fear of offending dairymen and
landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Dated though Arrowsmith's concerns are, the members of Solomon's
medical group, whose annual incomes range from $120,000 to
$300,000, also find themselves in thrall to financial constraints
and influenced by incentives that may run contrary to a patient's
well being. For example, they are under pressure to keep patients
from seeing specialists outside of CareGroup lest it reduce their
income. A doctor at another Boston HMO speaks for his patients:
``Are you really serving my best interest as a patient, doctor, or,
in fact, are you looking out for your best interest?''
</P>
<P>
   As the nation struggles to work out rational, compassionate,
economic health-care arrangements, the ethical issues faced by
Arrowsmith and those facing Solomon are not all that different. The
defiant Martin Arrowsmith ends up doing honest research of his own,
freed at last of the opportunism and corruption of the
practitioners around him. When last heard from, Martin Solomon is
explaining how he now must resist sending a patient to another
doctor even if he knows it might be to her benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether that is a good system, Solomon answers, ``I think
it stinks.''

 &HT;    Best search engine results come from knowing right techniques
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By now you are probably a veteran of the Web, with
dozens of bookmarks that help you return to the sites that fit into
your work and personal life. As long as you are searching for the
kind of information that falls within your usual routine, you
probably navigate your way along the Web efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problems come when you need to get outside that
normal box. If you spend most of your time comfortably learning
about epoxy chemicals and suddenly need to find information on
beekeeping, you may have to spend some time searching unfamiliar
areas to find what you need.
</P>
<P>
   That's where a search engine comes in. Because all use slightly
different techniques, it's a good idea to check the help section to
find out the best way to structure your search. To give an example
of how you can use good technique to make a search easier, we'll
start our search of search engines with AltaVista, at
www.altavista.com.
</P>
<P>
   The idea here is to avoid getting off-topic hits. So if you're
looking for information about your old friend Bill Husted on
AltaVista, you don't want to type that name in the keyword area. If
you do it that way, you'd get all the Bills of the Web and all the
Husteds. One way to narrow a search on AltaVista is to use the +
symbol before a word. If you search that way, and use this search
(+Bill +Husted) you'll get pages that must contain both names.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the best way. What you really want is a page with
the exact name. To get that, you need to put the name in quotes
like this: ``Bill Husted''. And that same technique works, of
course, if you want pages that contain the exact phrase ``for whom
the bell tolls'' ... you'd put the phrase in quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's move over to Yahoo, at www.yahoo.com, one of the
oldest of the general purpose search engines on the Web. It's handy
to know that the use of quote marks in a search term works exactly
the same way here. But there's a characteristic of Yahoo _ based on
the way it searches _ that can be of great help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first choices you'll see, if you do a Yahoo search,
is the fact that almost any search will return _ besides specific
Web pages that contain your search term _ a broader Yahoo category
that relates to your search. Here's an example that will help you
understand how that works. Let's say that you are searching for
garden seeds for spring planting. You'll get a list of companies
offering garden seeds that way, but you'll also get a list of
categories _ for instance, ``Business and Economy-Companies-Home
and Garden-Lawn and Garden-Seeds''
</P>
<P>
   (click on them and you'll be taken to a list of companies and
sites that fall within that category). That's a handy way to let
Yahoo do a lot of the searching work for you.
</P>
<P>
   A newer search engine that is really developing a big following
of fans is Google at www.google.com. If you know how to use
AltaVista, you already know how to use search terms on Google for
the most part. You can use the + symbol to require that a word be
included in the search and the - sign to require that a term not be
included.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at the use of the - sign in a search. Let's say that
you want to find out about the American eagle but that you're
interested in the bird, not an airline with that same name. So you
could frame a search this way (''American eagle'' -airline) and be
sure that you won't get hits from pages that discuss the airline or
flight schedules.

 &HT;    Spring is in the air, and it's time for a little low-tech
cleaning
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's spring and the automated birds outside of
TechnoBuddy Ranch are singing, the trees are fringed with green and
the pollen has me and Buddy the Maine Coon Cat both sneezing. And,
me being a traditional sort of a guy, it's spring cleaning time at
my house.
</P>
<P>
   That means that I'll have to set off a small nuclear device to
clean out the basement and also identify some of the objects that
the cat has placed under the beds and couches. But, for my
computers, it's also spring cleaning time. The truth is that it's a
really low-tech way to make sure that the computer has a chance of
lasting through spring into next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Dust and dirt builds up inside a computer. And unlike the
dustballs under your bed, this dust can literally kill your
computer. The good thing about this problem is that it's one you
can fix, even if most technical things leave you flustered.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have to warn you. This does involve taking the top off
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   But we'll go in easy stages, so that you can do the chores that
feel comfortable to you and just ignore those that make you feel
quivery inside.
</P>
<P>
   So let's leave the screwdriver alone for a moment and clean your
mouse. It's easy and my guess is that you'll notice the difference
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Just remove the retaining ring that holds in the little rubber
ball and take a look at the rollers inside the mouse. Use a cotton
swab, moistened with alcohol, to remove the dirt. Hold the mouse
upright, while you do this, so that any trash inside falls out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's do another easy chore. Clean the monitor's screen
(you're going to be surprised at the amount of dirt you find) using
either special screen cleaning pads available at the computer
store, or just a small amount of glass cleaner sprayed on a paper
towel.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is a little steeper, but I promise that you can do
it. We need to open up the computer for this one. Since not all
computer cases work the same way, you'll either need to figure it
out by looking, or dig out the manual.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid doing any harm, make sure that you don't touch anything
inside before you discharge any static electricity you may have
accumulated. You can do that by either buying a ``grounding strap''
which is a weird little gizmo that you wear on your hand, or you
can just make sure and touch the chassis before touching anything
inside the computer.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to unplug the computer, of course (although
professionals usually work inside with the computer plugged in, but
for mere mortals it's important to unplug the PC). Now find the
cooling fan toward the rear of your computer. Check to make sure
that it is free of dust and dirt. The fan keeps your computer cool
(a processor chip, while the computer is running, generates enough
heat to make popcorn). Since heat can age or even destroy
components, you need to make sure the fan is running correctly. And
anything that blocks the exhaust fan contributes to heat buildup.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to inspect the rest of the inside of the
computer, especially the main circuitboard called the motherboard.
Dust and dirt on the board can literally conduct enough electricity
to cause a short circuit. I once recommended that people use
compressed air to blow away the dust, or even a small hand vacuum
to clean it away (without letting the vacuum touch the components).
But since this is for beginners and since a mistake can do more
harm than the dust, I think I'll just recommend that you check for
excessive dirt and _ if you find it _ to get a professional to
clean the inside of the case for you.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for today. Spring cleaning is over. Now you can
perform the last ceremonial spring task. And that's to have some
spring tonic. I favor ice tea on the deck where I can watch the
trees.

 &HT;    Record companies should make digital downloads play to their
tune
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Even bad publicity is good publicity,'' the saying
goes. When it comes to digital downloads that's especially true.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Napster.com (www.napster.com). Napster offers
free downloads of a program that searches the Web for MP3 digital
music files and lets users download, share them and play them back
with Napster software.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is so easy to use that it became a favorite with college
students around the country. In fact, as you read this, they are
downloading and playing digital music files over the high-speed
Internet connections most colleges and universities provide.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone goes running off to download Napster with the
notion of hopping on the digital music bandwagon, it's important to
note that most online digital music files are bootlegs that are not
authorized by the artist or the recording company. If you download
the latest from the Smashing Pumpkins, Moby or Santana, it won't
cost you anything, but the artists don't make a dime _ not one red
cent. Many artists are more than a little upset about this, and the
Recording Industry Association of America is extremely upset.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the RIAA sued Napster, charging that its software
makes illegal music distribution easier. RIAA is asking for
$100,000 for each illegally distributed song.
</P>
<P>
   Also being sued for copyright infringement is MP3.com, the first
digital download ``portal'' that helps music lovers locate recorded
music available over the Internet. MP3.com has always defended its
business, saying that if the music industry would just stop
worrying and learn to love the Internet, there would be a way for
everybody to make money.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com founder Michael Robertson believes the music industry
should have taken the lead in providing a distribution method for
selling its wares online. Robertson said that way, there wouldn't
be so many ordinary people sifting through CD collections and
uploading digital copies of their favorite songs.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com has recently added a new section to its Web site called
``Lawsuit Central'' where users can read up on the latest salvos in
its ongoing battle with the music business.
(www.mp3.com/news/546.html).
</P>
<P>
   Although MP3.com is one of the most popular sites on the Web,
it's busy, complicated and hard to use. In an odd way, this has
worked to the record companies' advantage. If the average user
can't figure out how to download music files, then the industry
didn't have much to worry about. But then Napster came along and
changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is so easy to use, all users have to do is type in the
name of their favorite musicians and _ poof _ thousands of songs
pop up on the screen. Click on the one you want to download and in
a matter of minutes or hours (depending on your modem speed) you
have CD quality music on your PC.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good for the record industry, which now finds itself
looking at an easy-to-use program designed to download digital
music that they could have come up with themselves if they had
taken a long, analytical look at the Web a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Aram Sinnreich says Napster is a
very low-tech program that is very easy to replicate. He sees
Napster, not as something music companies should try to stomp out
or buy, but one that they should adapt to suit their own needs.
``It's all about more flexible product formats,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA suit is a vain attempt to make Napster and MP3.com
simply go away. But ironically, every stand the record industry
takes against online downloads seems to fan the flames and the
demand for online digital music.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is all the publicity. The very existence of Napster
first became known to mainstream music lovers because of the
lawsuit and efforts by Indiana University and Oregon State
University to block students from using the software. The colleges
said the high volume of students downloading music was taking up
too much bandwidth. This in turn, set off a storm of protest from
students. There is a ``Save Napster'' Web site
(www.savenapster.com) which calls the ban a form of censorship.
There are online blueprints outlining ways to circumvent the
university computer network. It also sparked a huge and continuing
debate over copyright and censorship laws on the World Wide Web
Artists Consortium (WWWAC) e-mail list of Silicon Alley insiders.
All of the interest has raised the profile of Napster, which has in
turn raised interest in digital downloads. Good for Napster, bad
for the RIAA.
</P>
<P>
   All the fussing and shouting is increasing interest and demand.
Maybe it will finally move the record companies to do what
Jupiter's Sinnreich suggests: Finally develop their own Web
business mode similar to Napster but incorporating some way to make
money from it. While the lawyers work on copyright protection,
maybe a few designers should be working on their Web sites.

 &HT;    Get wired without a PC
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Want to check your e-mail but don't have time to fire
up the computer? Check it on your cell phone or from the dashboard
of your car.
</P>
<P>
   Need some sports scores but left your laptop in your trunk?
Punch a few buttons on your Web wristwatch and you're online in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   With the escalating consumer clamor for easy e-mail and
user-friendly online access, technology companies have been racing
to develop more and more methods for connecting to the Web without
a clunky computer. These new gadgets are appealing to two markets:
Techno-savvy users who want on-the-go Internet and people
uncomfortable with PCs who just want a taste of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``As computers become easier to use, there's still some level of
technology that's beyond most people,'' says Scott Testa with
Mindbridge.com, a company that creates Web-based software.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want simple devices that don't do everything but do two
or three simple tasks very easily,'' says Testa. ``You're going to
see the computer, the TV, the telephone morph into these devices. A
typical house may have one computer, one of these appliances and a
TV with Net access.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Consumer Electronics Association's International Show in
Las Vegas in early January, the products that generated the most
oohs and aahs were these so-called Internet appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an explosion in these kinds of devices,'' says
CEA's Jeff Joseph. ``More and more people want Web access without
having to be tied to a desktop computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``best of show'' honors went to InfoGear's iPhone, a $399
gadget complete with a touch screen, keyboard and software that
lets users communicate by phone and e-mail, and access the Internet
_ including both banking and shopping online.
</P>
<P>
   The iPhone has been around since 1998 but has gone through a
half-dozen upgrades since then, based on customer feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new Net appliances are geared toward the
techno-shy. Products like MailStation ($99.95 and up) and MailBug
($129.95) are countertop devices that let you have e-mail without
the price and complexity of a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that there are so many folks who are so intimidated
by PCs. They want e-mail but have no need or interest in learning
how to operate a PC,'' says MailBug's Bryan McCormick. He quotes
statistics: 50 percent of American households don't have a PC, but
93 percent have a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think e-mail should be as ubiquitous as the telephone, and
it will never happen if it's dependent on something as complicated
as a computer,'' says McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   Another device generating a lot of buzz is the i-opener from
Netpliance. Resembling a slimmed-down computer, the device offers
easy e-mail and Internet access with a flat-panel screen and
keyboard. Retailing at $199, the i-opener promises to be up and
working within five minutes after it arrives at your door.
</P>
<P>
   For James Bond types, Casio even offers a wristwatch that lets
you exchange data with your PC.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of this technology is fairly new, many people have
been surfing without a computer for some time on WebTV. For more
than three years, WebTV has offered subscribers the ability to surf
the Net and send e-mail from the comfort of their recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Now in 1 million homes, WebTV ($99-$199) offers a range of
possibilities _ like creating Web pages and playing along with
Interactive TV programs. According to WebTV customer demographics
information, nearly three-quarters of all WebTV subscribers don't
own a computer; more than half have no prior Internet experience.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that allows e-mail and Net surfing isn't limited
to stand-alone appliances like TV sets and phones, however. A
company called Planetweb makes Internet software that goes into
non-computer consumer electronics. Currently, that technology is
available in the home video game, Sega Dreamcast ($199), letting
game players go online, using their TV set as a computer screen,
their remote control as a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Planetweb Internet browser will start appearing
on some new DVD players _ called iDVDs. It will allow viewers to go
online and check movie reviews, program guides and more before
watching a show. The price of the iDVD will depend on the company
that uses the technology, says Planetweb spokesman Jim Wallace. So
far, Aiwa is on board.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their out-of-the-box cost, all of these new
Internet appliances require an Internet connection. If you already
have an Internet service provider, there's no additional cost for
most. If you're not already plugged in, you can either choose your
own ISP or take advantage of special deals that most of the
manufacturers provide. The monthly access fee is often $10 or so _
usually half of what the major ISPs charge per month.
</P>
<P>
   While many of these products are already available, some are
still on the drawing board. Some auto manufacturers, for example,
are working on built-in hands-free e-mail retrieval from the
comfort of your car. While you're driving, you can check e-mail
messages and even answer them using voice-recognition capabilities.
(Sounds an awful lot like voice mail!)
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works are boom boxes that would have wireless
connections to the Internet. You could download MP3 files right
into your boom box and play them instantly on the go.
</P>
<P>
   These products apparently aren't so far-fetched. Industry
analysts agree that Net appliances are the hot techo-gadgets du
jour.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I need a computer to surf the Web is like saying I need
a computer to talk on the phone,'' says Internet expert and author
Mark Minasi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We geeks thought the way the world would get wired was that
everybody would grow smart and techy. We were wrong. The products
just got simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   Minasi likens these Net appliances to the traditional telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid we had one phone. Now we have them all over
the house,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years from now _ maybe less _ every room in the house
will have Internet access. This is coming so fast you can't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Agrees the CEA's Joseph, ``We have met the Jetsons and they are
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy e-mail access from tiny device.

 &HT;    Movies may come to a computer screen near you
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Academy Awards last week focused America's
attention on the movies. But there may come a day when movies
aren't confined to the theater, VCR or DVD.
</P>
<P>
   There's a real move toward the Internet. As high-speed access
becomes more common, some experts think that movies will be
available for viewing in real time on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The April edition of Yahoo magazine takes a look at that trend
and predicts that ``when bandwidth and signal quality get better _
and they're getting better fast _ more users will be willing to
watch a movie on their computer screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Many problems, quality and broadband aside, remain.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, will people want to watch a big movie on such a
small screen?
</P>
<P>
   While computer monitor sizes have grown, the best of them don't
approach the size of the average TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting twist that may help studios market these
movies-over-the-Internet is the fact that some studios may use the
marketing ploy of either releasing the movies first on the Net, or
making the Net version available as soon as the movie is released _
beating VCR and DVD versions to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   'WHO GIVES A GIGABYTE?'
</P>
<P>
   The book is called a ``survival guide for the technologically
perplexed'' but it's really an entertaining and well-researched
guide to the new technologies that seem to be popping up faster
than normal people can cope.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you've learned what one set of initials stands for,
the next appears.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Who Gives a Gigbyte?,'' isn't confined to computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes a look at alternative energy sources and their
importance in a world that runs on oil and gas, and the
implications of altering genes in an effort to build the perfect
tomato.
</P>
<P>
   The book sells for $16.95 and is published by John Wiley &AMP; Sons.
It should be available now in most large bookstores as well as from
online sources.
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S GOING TO BE A REVOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   Music is a driving force on the Internet and there's a new
magazine called Revolution that will soon be hitting newsstands
with its premier spring edition.
</P>
<P>
   It's slick and upscale and will emphasize the high-tech aspects
of music. For instance, the first edition of the magazine will look
at the best MP3 music on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution will be a gadget-lovers' dream, including coverage of
the latest players and also the best of the conventional amplifiers
and other stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Playing off that high-tech nature, each edition of the magazine
will contain a CD of some of the best of the new music.
</P>
<P>
   The first CD will include tunes from Kenlou such as ``Voodoo
Princess'' and ``Axus' My Planet Rocks.''

 &HT;    Baseball was never this easy
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're a baseball fan, you've been there. It's late
in the game and the coach can't seem to pull the starting pitcher,
who's getting shelled. Or maybe it's August, the left fielder is
starting to wilt and the coach won't bench him for a few games to
get his strength back.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for all this, other than starting an Internet company,
selling it in 18 months and then buying your own team, is fantasy
baseball. The Internet version.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Web, fantasy baseball required effort. Here's how it
works: A group of people form a league, pick teams and hold a draft
to divide the best major league players. Eight to 12 teams per
league are recommended. Any less packs teams with all-stars. More
makes each team the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Teams earn points based on how well their players perform. The
everyday players are ranked using their offensive statistics: team
batting average, home runs, runs batted in and stolen bases.
Pitchers earn points by team earned run average, wins, saves and
team WHIP ratio (walks plus hits, divided by the number of innings
pitched).
</P>
<P>
   In the pencil and paper days, that meant a lot of record
keeping, tons of stat-checking and some serious math. Hardly tasks
fit for a sports mogul.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Web sites offer free fantasy baseball leagues; most
do the math for you.
</P>
<P>
   Owners can check their team performances each day, and the
previous day's performance already will have been factored in. It
reduces fantasy baseball to the relative joy of dialing up
Yahoo.com to check your stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   That frees you to do the real work of the owner _ making trades,
firing coaches and angling for taxpayer-subsidized stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is loaded with fantasy sports sites. A quick search
last week on Google.com, one of the Web's best search engines,
found 17,900 fantasy baseball entries in less than two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasybaseballcentral.com is as thorough a place as any to
start. It divides links to fantasy baseball-related sites by
category.

 &HT;    End Task with care
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   When I hit Ctrl-Alt-Del, the screen shows a list of running
programs, many of which I don't recognize. For example: Explorer,
NsDee32, Realplay, Osa, Tsystray, Rundll, Systray, Aim, Imgicon.
Are these necessary? Should I End Task on each of them or just
ignore? Can, or should, they be deleted? Do they affect the speed
of my computer?
</P>
<P>
   _Larry Goldberg
</P>
<P>
   Sue: On Windows 95/98 machines, any time you do a
Ctrl-Alt-Delete to reboot your computer, the Task Manager will come
up. It's a list of all running applications, some system-critical.
It manages the applications that are activated and working and
those no longer responding. If you don't know what an item is
(because it may be a system app), do not End Task.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Be careful. System apps make your computer go.
``End-Tasking'' them won't speed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I made the mistake of letting my kids play games on my Macintosh
Powerbook G3. They changed my password, and neither of them can
remember what they used. Can I access the computer to restore or
change my password without losing data? I called a couple of
dealers, and they want to charge me too much.
</P>
<P>
   _Keith W. Allen Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Ah, it seems you are now the proud owner of an expensive
paperweight.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: No, Sue's making a funny. All is not lost. We checked
with Apple Tech Support and found that, unless you want to
initialize your hard drive, you must take your Powerbook and
receipt to an Apple dealer to have the password reset without
losing data. If your computer is under warranty, you may not have
to shell out anything.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: If you really want to do this yourself, initializing is the
only way. Apparently, the password is written to the driver level.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I lost the basic toolbar in Microsoft Word. I can't see the
File, Edit, Tool, maximum, minimum or the ``X'' to close the
window. They are off the screen. This happens only in Word. I have
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   _Anthony Kuchta
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Let's start simple. Did you accidentally move the Menu
Toolbar to the side, or is it now a floating menu? Is it minimized
into the menu bar at the bottom of your screen? This is easy to do
and can cause some confusion. I've been there. You also should go
to Toolbars under the View Menu and select Customize. Is Menu Bar
selected? If not, put a check in the box.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Also, it could be a deeper issue. Have you installed
software lately? We've seen software conflicts that cause menus to
get wiggy. Try reinstalling Microsoft Word. Nine times out of 10,
it'll do the trick.

 &HT;    Program changes how Windows looks on screen
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Generally speaking, I adhere to the dictum that, like
the old commercial in which a ditzy woman in robes intoned that
``it's not nice to fool Mother Nature,'' it generally doesn't pay
to fool Windows.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'm having a lot of fun with a $20 shareware program
called WindowBlinds from Stardock.
</P>
<P>
   WindowBlinds is a one-trick pony, which is really to its
advantage. It doesn't try to change the way Windows works or add
anything to it. It just changes its appearance _ a little or a lot,
depending on your taste.
</P>
<P>
   It does this through the use of what it calls ``skins,'' which
apply different colors, borders and so forth for Windows and the
programs running under Windows. The program comes with half a dozen
of these skins, and you can download a lot more from the company's
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   You can even make your own, if you are so inclined. It involves
learning the program's simple programming language, but I don't
think it would be a huge task.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the selling points of WindowBlinds: if you are
running a company with a lot of PCs, you can design a skin that
includes your company logo not only on the desktop but also
inserted artistically into the title bar or whatever on every
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the skins are quite soothing and tasteful; one I just
downloaded is a zingy number with lights chasing each other
constantly along the title bar.
</P>
<P>
   In the extensive help file, StarDock warns that you may very
well have problems with WindowBlinds at first, generated by various
programs or pieces of hardware that don't get along with it.
Trouble-shooting routines are provided to help you work around
these problems.
</P>
<P>
   I had a problem which, according to the guide, was caused by my
display card. The suggested work around took care of it.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while I get an obscure error message that
doesn't seem to be having an effect on anything. If I intend to
keep using WindowBlinds, I'll have to spend some time figuring out
how to cure whatever's causing it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the rub. Do you want to do a cosmetic make over of
Windows badly enough to spend $20, a mere pittance as software
goes, and likely inherit problems that have to be ironed out?
</P>
<P>
   I think the skin I'm running now looks great. It remains to be
seen whether I'm attached to it enough to put some time into
trouble-shooting.
</P>
<P>
   WindowBlinds is a subset of Stardock's Object Desktop, which is
an elaborate program that does change the way Windows works and
adds features to it.
</P>
<P>
   You can go to www.stardock.com and follow the menus to get more
information on WindowBlinds and download the program for trial.

 &HT;    Zombie Revenge a raw shooting spree lacking depth
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Raw and unassuming gameplay makes Sega's Zombie Revenge ($40;
www.dreamcast.com) a near-brainless third-person romp through
innumerable levels plagued by the undead. A thin, post
apocalyptic/secret-experiment-gone-awry story stands as the premise
behind nonstop shooting of rampaging rotting corpses. Terrific
graphics and intuitive control makes for a fast-paced, auto-aiming
killing spree replete with health grabs, power-ups and various
high- and low-tech weapons of mass-dismemberment pick-ups.
Surprisingly addictive in spite of its lack of depth, Zombie
Revenge works as a tremendous stress reliever without all the
inherent guilt of amoral behavior. After all, these aren't
simulated people splooshing and splattering, glorping and gooing
all over the TV screen; they're zombies, and zombies aren't real.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Flight sim fans want tons of the eye candy but they also want
the tiny details done right. On both counts, Jane's F/A-18A
Simulator ($40 for the PC, www.ea.com) further builds the sim
maker's reputation as the real deal with what might be the best
military flight sim yet. From the instructive, fun tutorials to the
massive campaign options, from the fabulously detailed cockpit to
the lush terrain below, Jane's has focused on a single aircraft and
gotten everything right. A white-knuckle landing in bad weather on
a carrier deck is unforgettable, and with great multiplayer
options, there's very little here to criticize. The game runs great
even on a modestly powerful machine, and many options are available
to customize the difficulty settings, so that this game, crafted
with hard-core simmers in mind, is not beyond the reach of the
casual desktop pilot.

 &HT;    All dressed up with nowhere to go
 &HT;    By Joe Stafford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first test of a CD-ROM for children is
really about ease of use: Can you install it, set your child in
front of it and walk away, confident that the software will do the
rest? Unfortunately, that standard is beyond The American Girls
Dress Designer ($30 for Windows, www.mattelmedia.com) _ one of
woefully few programs aimed at pre-teen girls _ which is limited in
scope, yet difficult to use. On the positive side, the program lets
girls pick and create fabric patterns, colors and other trim for
finishing touches on clothes that can be printed out and used on
paper dolls of girls throughout American history. The artwork is of
a high standard, but our 8-year-old tester quickly got frustrated
with the program's limitations on her imagination: With too few
options toward the stated purpose of actually designing clothes,
she quickly lost interest.

   PAVLOVCE NAD UHOM, Slovakia _ On the night of Feb. 7, Tibor
Tancos and Vlasta Tancosova were walking along the edge of the
street with their 12-year-old son, Tomas, when a drunk in a
blue-green Honda ran them down with his car. Tomas survived, but
his parents died.
</P>
<P>
   The police in this northeast corner of Slovakia aren't so
efficient in the best of times, but in post-communist Slovakia,
open discrimination against the Roma, or Gypsies, is the norm.
Rather than arresting the suspect, a well-known Slovak
business-mafia type, the police have instead threatened family
members and have beaten some of them, the family says. The
grandfather in the household, also named Tibor Tancos, has
complained but expects no justice. ``Nothing will come of it,'' he
said. ``We have no rights here, we Roma.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roma are Europe's stateless people, at least 8 million of
them scattered and mostly reviled throughout Central and Eastern
Europe. While half a million Roma died in the Holocaust, which the
Roma call ``the devouring,'' they remain the one people in the
modern, democratic, post-communist Europe whom it is largely
acceptable to persecute.
</P>
<P>
   Europe talks much of common aspirations and a continental
identity. But the 1990s made clear that Europe's most virulent
problem remains prejudice toward minorities and their exclusion
from a full range of democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav civil wars focused attention on the dangers of a
militant nationalism, but in a misleading way. When most of Europe
goes to war with a small corner of the continent to defend the
rights of an oppressed people in Kosovo, it can seem as if
Europeans have learned the lesson of tolerance and are simply
disciplining an outmoded recalcitrant, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the worsening plight of the Roma and the increasing
intolerance in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989 are bracing
antidotes to smugness about the post-communist spread of shared
values.
</P>
<P>
   The Roma have been despised for centuries as alien, thieving
subhumans (or as singing-and-dancing cartoons out of ``Carmen'')
with no allegiance to their countries or the law. Their culture and
habits combine with discrimination to produce a cycle of poverty,
poor schooling, bad health care and unemployment that are a
function of prejudice but also feed it, contributing to crime
rates, isolation and suspicion of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Europe _ West or East _ shows little interest in
breaking the cycle of isolation and prejudice. There is no offer of
inclusion in society, or even, as here in Slovakia, much protection
from racial discrimination and violence, whether from neo-fascist
skinheads or the police.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of the Roma _ including a denial of asylum in
countries like Britain, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden _ raises
serious questions about the basic principles of postwar Europe that
the European Union says it holds dear. Even in NATO-occupied
Kosovo, some 100,000 of the 125,000 Roma have fled or been forced
to flee by the victorious ethnic Albanians, who say the Roma
collaborated with the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech president, Vaclav Havel, once noted, ``The Gypsies are
a litmus test, not of democracy but of civil society.'' If so, the
post-communist world is failing the test.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly 10 percent of Slovakia's 5 million people are
Roma, yet they are largely excluded from the mainstream of normal
life. According to a newspaper poll, 60 percent of Slovaks favor
their segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia and Romania are particularly vile to this minority,
which represents about 8 percent of Romania's population. But
Hungary and the Czech Republic discriminate widely too, especially
in education and employment. According to another newspaper poll
published last year, some 39 percent of Czechs still say that
``only force is effective'' in dealing with the Gypsies, while 15
percent say that the skinheads do a good job keeping them in line.
</P>
<P>
   Roma say almost unanimously that their lives and circumstances
are much worse now than under communism, when discrimination was at
least limited by ideology. The end of the communist pledge of full
employment _ no matter how artificial the work in a world where it
was illegal to be jobless _ has meant widespread and sometimes
total unemployment throughout Central and Eastern Europe for Roma,
who are the first to be fired in post-communist ``restructurings''
and who are rarely hired again for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is much worse for Roma than it was in 1989,'' said Claude
Cahn of the European Roma Rights Center, an independent foundation
based in Budapest. He cites official Slovak statistics showing that
80 percent of Roma children attended kindergarten in 1989-90, while
only 15 percent do today.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Roma children in Slovakia are in ``special
schools'' intended for the mentally handicapped. In the Czech
Republic, a Roma child is 15 times more likely to be labeled
retarded than a non-Roma child.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Danihel, the Slovak government's representative for the
Roma, said estimates for Roma unemployment today are ``between 90
and 100 percent,'' which he admits stems as much from
``intolerance, ignorance and xenophobia'' as from any lack of skill
or education.

   Communism had its horrors for Roma, too: In preaching
assimilation, it repressed Roma language and culture, paid women to
be sterilized as a method of birth control, and often took Roma
children from their parents to raise them in orphanages, said
Miroslav Lacko, a Roma activist in Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, in Romania's wretched orphanages, nearly 75 percent
of the children are Roma.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the economic hopelessness and a widespread tolerance for
skinhead and police violence against the Roma have prompted a large
exodus, at first to Canada, that began about 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ondrej Gina, head of the Roma Cultural Union in the Czech
Republic, said about 20 percent of the Czech Roma have left, and
many thousands have left or tried to leave Slovakia, Romania and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers have overwhelmed international goodwill, and
Western countries have responded with new visa requirements,
deportations and the tightening of immigration and asylum
regulations. In a report about to be released, Amnesty
International says British officials are making it more difficult
for asylum seekers to reach Britain, are making conditions for Roma
unpleasant while they await judgment there and are ``almost
automatically'' rejecting their appeals as driven only by poverty
rather than persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Roma have no reason to stay where they live,'' Cahn said.
``They are excluded from employment. Their housing is appalling.
They are hated. Their schooling will get them nowhere. They are not
components of the societies in which they exist. But Western Europe
deports them back. They are what the Nazis called luftmenschen,
people of the air, and it's hard to know on what they live.''
</P>
<P>
   All European societies regard the darker-skinned Roma as alien
and not a component of the majority population, which tends to be
monoethnic, Cahn said. Still, the desire of countries like the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland to join the European
Union has brought new pressure to improve the lives and treatment
of Roma at home _ so they will stay there. But in general,
Roma-directed programs are vague and badly financed.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Slovakia's new government is far better than that of
its nationalist predecessor, whose prime minister, Vladimir Meciar,
called Roma ``mental retards.'' But after 18 months, Denihel still
speaks of plans and studies and strategies and approaches. ``It's
all talk and nothing happens,'' say the parents of the dead couple,
Tibor and Vlasta Tancos.
</P>
<P>
   Tibor's father said his whole family used to work, but now no
one has a job. Skinheads force the Roma to stay in their houses at
night; restaurants and bars often do not let them enter. When he
complained to the police again, he said: ``One officer said: `It
wasn't a government minister who was killed.' So what does that
mean, that a dog or a cat was killed? Aren't we human?''
</P>
<P>
   Vlasta's father, Anton Demeter, said: ``You can't get justice
here. Everybody complained about the communists. But under the
communists, the murderer wouldn't be sitting at home right now,
while my daughter is in her grave. And now we have democracy, and
it's all supposed to be better. And they're surprised that Roma go
abroad? And the Slovaks want to go to Europe like this? This isn't
democracy.''

 &HT;    Best search engine results come from knowing right techniques
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By now you are probably a veteran of the Web, with
dozens of bookmarks that help you return to the sites that fit into
your work and personal life. As long as you are searching for the
kind of information that falls within your usual routine, you
probably navigate your way along the Web efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problems come when you need to get outside that
normal box. If you spend most of your time comfortably learning
about epoxy chemicals and suddenly need to find information on
beekeeping, you may have to spend some time searching unfamiliar
areas to find what you need.
</P>
<P>
   That's where a search engine comes in. Because all use slightly
different techniques, it's a good idea to check the help section to
find out the best way to structure your search. To give an example
of how you can use good technique to make a search easier, we'll
start our search of search engines with AltaVista, at
www.altavista.com.
</P>
<P>
   The idea here is to avoid getting off-topic hits. So if you're
looking for information about your old friend Bill Husted on
AltaVista, you don't want to type that name in the keyword area. If
you do it that way, you'd get all the Bills of the Web and all the
Husteds. One way to narrow a search on AltaVista is to use the +
symbol before a word. If you search that way, and use this search
(+Bill +Husted) you'll get pages that must contain both names.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the best way. What you really want is a page with
the exact name. To get that, you need to put the name in quotes
like this: ``Bill Husted''. And that same technique works, of
course, if you want pages that contain the exact phrase ``for whom
the bell tolls'' ... you'd put the phrase in quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's move over to Yahoo, at www.yahoo.com, one of the
oldest of the general purpose search engines on the Web. It's handy
to know that the use of quote marks in a search term works exactly
the same way here. But there's a characteristic of Yahoo _ based on
the way it searches _ that can be of great help.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first choices you'll see, if you do a Yahoo search,
is the fact that almost any search will return _ besides specific
Web pages that contain your search term _ a broader Yahoo category
that relates to your search. Here's an example that will help you
understand how that works. Let's say that you are searching for
garden seeds for spring planting. You'll get a list of companies
offering garden seeds that way, but you'll also get a list of
categories _ for instance, ``Business and Economy-Companies-Home
and Garden-Lawn and Garden-Seeds''
</P>
<P>
   (click on them and you'll be taken to a list of companies and
sites that fall within that category). That's a handy way to let
Yahoo do a lot of the searching work for you.
</P>
<P>
   A newer search engine that is really developing a big following
of fans is Google at www.google.com. If you know how to use
AltaVista, you already know how to use search terms on Google for
the most part. You can use the + symbol to require that a word be
included in the search and the - sign to require that a term not be
included.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at the use of the - sign in a search. Let's say that
you want to find out about the American eagle but that you're
interested in the bird, not an airline with that same name. So you
could frame a search this way (''American eagle'' -airline) and be
sure that you won't get hits from pages that discuss the airline or
flight schedules.

 &HT;    Record companies should make digital downloads play to their
tune
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Even bad publicity is good publicity,'' the saying
goes. When it comes to digital downloads that's especially true.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Napster.com (www.napster.com). Napster offers
free downloads of a program that searches the Web for MP3 digital
music files and lets users download, share them and play them back
with Napster software.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is so easy to use that it became a favorite with college
students around the country. In fact, as you read this, they are
downloading and playing digital music files over the high-speed
Internet connections most colleges and universities provide.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone goes running off to download Napster with the
notion of hopping on the digital music bandwagon, it's important to
note that most online digital music files are bootlegs that are not
authorized by the artist or the recording company. If you download
the latest from the Smashing Pumpkins, Moby or Santana, it won't
cost you anything, but the artists don't make a dime _ not one red
cent. Many artists are more than a little upset about this, and the
Recording Industry Association of America is extremely upset.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the RIAA sued Napster, charging that its software
makes illegal music distribution easier. RIAA is asking for
$100,000 for each illegally distributed song.
</P>
<P>
   Also being sued for copyright infringement is MP3.com, the first
digital download ``portal'' that helps music lovers locate recorded
music available over the Internet. MP3.com has always defended its
business, saying that if the music industry would just stop
worrying and learn to love the Internet, there would be a way for
everybody to make money.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com founder Michael Robertson believes the music industry
should have taken the lead in providing a distribution method for
selling its wares online. Robertson said that way, there wouldn't
be so many ordinary people sifting through CD collections and
uploading digital copies of their favorite songs.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com has recently added a new section to its Web site called
``Lawsuit Central'' where users can read up on the latest salvos in
its ongoing battle with the music business.
(www.mp3.com/news/546.html).
</P>
<P>
   Although MP3.com is one of the most popular sites on the Web,
it's busy, complicated and hard to use. In an odd way, this has
worked to the record companies' advantage. If the average user
can't figure out how to download music files, then the industry
didn't have much to worry about. But then Napster came along and
changed everything.

   Napster is so easy to use, all users have to do is type in the
name of their favorite musicians and _ poof _ thousands of songs
pop up on the screen. Click on the one you want to download and in
a matter of minutes or hours (depending on your modem speed) you
have CD quality music on your PC.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good for the record industry, which now finds itself
looking at an easy-to-use program designed to download digital
music that they could have come up with themselves if they had
taken a long, analytical look at the Web a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Aram Sinnreich says Napster is a
very low-tech program that is very easy to replicate. He sees
Napster, not as something music companies should try to stomp out
or buy, but one that they should adapt to suit their own needs.
``It's all about more flexible product formats,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA suit is a vain attempt to make Napster and MP3.com
simply go away. But ironically, every stand the record industry
takes against online downloads seems to fan the flames and the
demand for online digital music.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is all the publicity. The very existence of Napster
first became known to mainstream music lovers because of the
lawsuit and efforts by Indiana University and Oregon State
University to block students from using the software. The colleges
said the high volume of students downloading music was taking up
too much bandwidth. This in turn, set off a storm of protest from
students. There is a ``Save Napster'' Web site
(www.savenapster.com) which calls the ban a form of censorship.
There are online blueprints outlining ways to circumvent the
university computer network. It also sparked a huge and continuing
debate over copyright and censorship laws on the World Wide Web
Artists Consortium (WWWAC) e-mail list of Silicon Alley insiders.
All of the interest has raised the profile of Napster, which has in
turn raised interest in digital downloads. Good for Napster, bad
for the RIAA.
</P>
<P>
   All the fussing and shouting is increasing interest and demand.
Maybe it will finally move the record companies to do what
Jupiter's Sinnreich suggests: Finally develop their own Web
business mode similar to Napster but incorporating some way to make
money from it. While the lawyers work on copyright protection,
maybe a few designers should be working on their Web sites.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ You want to look good while listening to your
tunes. That's why you need to pick up Sony's Street Style Discman
($160, www.sony.
</P>
<P>
   com). The industrial-looking Discman is a must-have for the
trendy, on-the-go set. The device is finished in chrome and red
translucent plastic and has a carrying strap, making it the
ultimate accoutrement to a rollerblading escapade. The Street Style
Discman also comes with Street Style headphones, which wrap around
the back of the head and provide awesome sound. If you think this
portable CD player just looks good, think again. This Discman is
equipped with Sony's patented ESP2, which is some of the best skip
protection on the market. With ESP2 and the Street Style Discman,
you'll never miss a beat _ and look good in the process.

   Touted as the PlayStation's ``first Mini Wheel that rumbles as
you drive,'' Madcatz's Hand Held Racing Wheel ($35;
www.madcatz.com) combines smooth analog steering and lots of
digital action buttons in an innovative compact design and is
endorsed, of course, by Madcatz spokesman and racing legend Mario
Andretti. While the unit is terribly comfortable with its ergonomic
pistol-grip shape and side-mounted, firm and responsive little
wheel conveying healthful resistance, button configuration leaves a
little to be desired, especially for games that require/demand
simultaneous application of throttle and brake and a gear change or
three. Still, a great vibrating RC style wheel/controller for
straightforward, pedal-to-the-medal racing games such as NASCAR,
FI, Motocross or Superbike _ and it's just a peach with GT
Interactive's Driver _ but rally games just aren't attuned to this
particular design.

 &HT;    Baseball was never this easy
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're a baseball fan, you've been there. It's late
in the game and the coach can't seem to pull the starting pitcher,
who's getting shelled. Or maybe it's August, the left fielder is
starting to wilt and the coach won't bench him for a few games to
get his strength back.
</P>
<P>
   The cure for all this, other than starting an Internet company,
selling it in 18 months and then buying your own team, is fantasy
baseball. The Internet version.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Web, fantasy baseball required effort. Here's how it
works: A group of people form a league, pick teams and hold a draft
to divide the best major league players. Eight to 12 teams per
league are recommended. Any less packs teams with all-stars. More
makes each team the Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Teams earn points based on how well their players perform. The
everyday players are ranked using their offensive statistics: team
batting average, home runs, runs batted in and stolen bases.
Pitchers earn points by team earned run average, wins, saves and
team WHIP ratio (walks plus hits, divided by the number of innings
pitched).
</P>
<P>
   In the pencil and paper days, that meant a lot of record
keeping, tons of stat-checking and some serious math. Hardly tasks
fit for a sports mogul.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Web sites offer free fantasy baseball leagues; most
do the math for you.
</P>
<P>
   Owners can check their team performances each day, and the
previous day's performance already will have been factored in. It
reduces fantasy baseball to the relative joy of dialing up
Yahoo.com to check your stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   That frees you to do the real work of the owner _ making trades,
firing coaches and angling for taxpayer-subsidized stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is loaded with fantasy sports sites. A quick search
last week on Google.com, one of the Web's best search engines,
found 17,900 fantasy baseball entries in less than two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasybaseballcentral.com is as thorough a place as any to
start. It divides links to fantasy baseball-related sites by
category.

 &HT;    End Task with care
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   When I hit Ctrl-Alt-Del, the screen shows a list of running
programs, many of which I don't recognize. For example: Explorer,
NsDee32, Realplay, Osa, Tsystray, Rundll, Systray, Aim, Imgicon.
Are these necessary? Should I End Task on each of them or just
ignore? Can, or should, they be deleted? Do they affect the speed
of my computer?
</P>
<P>
   _Larry Goldberg
</P>
<P>
   Sue: On Windows 95/98 machines, any time you do a
Ctrl-Alt-Delete to reboot your computer, the Task Manager will come
up. It's a list of all running applications, some system-critical.
It manages the applications that are activated and working and
those no longer responding. If you don't know what an item is
(because it may be a system app), do not End Task.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Be careful. System apps make your computer go.
``End-Tasking'' them won't speed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I made the mistake of letting my kids play games on my Macintosh
Powerbook G3. They changed my password, and neither of them can
remember what they used. Can I access the computer to restore or
change my password without losing data? I called a couple of
dealers, and they want to charge me too much.
</P>
<P>
   _Keith W. Allen Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Ah, it seems you are now the proud owner of an expensive
paperweight.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: No, Sue's making a funny. All is not lost. We checked
with Apple Tech Support and found that, unless you want to
initialize your hard drive, you must take your Powerbook and
receipt to an Apple dealer to have the password reset without
losing data. If your computer is under warranty, you may not have
to shell out anything.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: If you really want to do this yourself, initializing is the
only way. Apparently, the password is written to the driver level.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I lost the basic toolbar in Microsoft Word. I can't see the
File, Edit, Tool, maximum, minimum or the ``X'' to close the
window. They are off the screen. This happens only in Word. I have
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   _Anthony Kuchta
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Let's start simple. Did you accidentally move the Menu
Toolbar to the side, or is it now a floating menu? Is it minimized
into the menu bar at the bottom of your screen? This is easy to do
and can cause some confusion. I've been there. You also should go
to Toolbars under the View Menu and select Customize. Is Menu Bar
selected? If not, put a check in the box.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Also, it could be a deeper issue. Have you installed
software lately? We've seen software conflicts that cause menus to
get wiggy. Try reinstalling Microsoft Word. Nine times out of 10,
it'll do the trick.

 &HT;    Spring is in the air, and it's time for a little low-tech
cleaning
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's spring and the automated birds outside of
TechnoBuddy Ranch are singing, the trees are fringed with green and
the pollen has me and Buddy the Maine Coon Cat both sneezing. And,
me being a traditional sort of a guy, it's spring cleaning time at
my house.
</P>
<P>
   That means that I'll have to set off a small nuclear device to
clean out the basement and also identify some of the objects that
the cat has placed under the beds and couches. But, for my
computers, it's also spring cleaning time. The truth is that it's a
really low-tech way to make sure that the computer has a chance of
lasting through spring into next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Dust and dirt builds up inside a computer. And unlike the
dustballs under your bed, this dust can literally kill your
computer. The good thing about this problem is that it's one you
can fix, even if most technical things leave you flustered.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have to warn you. This does involve taking the top off
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   But we'll go in easy stages, so that you can do the chores that
feel comfortable to you and just ignore those that make you feel
quivery inside.
</P>
<P>
   So let's leave the screwdriver alone for a moment and clean your
mouse. It's easy and my guess is that you'll notice the difference
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Just remove the retaining ring that holds in the little rubber
ball and take a look at the rollers inside the mouse. Use a cotton
swab, moistened with alcohol, to remove the dirt. Hold the mouse
upright, while you do this, so that any trash inside falls out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's do another easy chore. Clean the monitor's screen
(you're going to be surprised at the amount of dirt you find) using
either special screen cleaning pads available at the computer
store, or just a small amount of glass cleaner sprayed on a paper
towel.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is a little steeper, but I promise that you can do
it. We need to open up the computer for this one. Since not all
computer cases work the same way, you'll either need to figure it
out by looking, or dig out the manual.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid doing any harm, make sure that you don't touch anything
inside before you discharge any static electricity you may have
accumulated. You can do that by either buying a ``grounding strap''
which is a weird little gizmo that you wear on your hand, or you
can just make sure and touch the chassis before touching anything
inside the computer.
</P>
<P>
   You'll want to unplug the computer, of course (although
professionals usually work inside with the computer plugged in, but
for mere mortals it's important to unplug the PC). Now find the
cooling fan toward the rear of your computer. Check to make sure
that it is free of dust and dirt. The fan keeps your computer cool
(a processor chip, while the computer is running, generates enough
heat to make popcorn). Since heat can age or even destroy
components, you need to make sure the fan is running correctly. And
anything that blocks the exhaust fan contributes to heat buildup.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to inspect the rest of the inside of the
computer, especially the main circuitboard called the motherboard.
Dust and dirt on the board can literally conduct enough electricity
to cause a short circuit. I once recommended that people use
compressed air to blow away the dust, or even a small hand vacuum
to clean it away (without letting the vacuum touch the components).
But since this is for beginners and since a mistake can do more
harm than the dust, I think I'll just recommend that you check for
excessive dirt and _ if you find it _ to get a professional to
clean the inside of the case for you.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for today. Spring cleaning is over. Now you can
perform the last ceremonial spring task. And that's to have some
spring tonic. I favor ice tea on the deck where I can watch the
trees.

   TRAIN WRECK
</P>
<P>
   Clues to school bus tragedy
</P>
<P>
   What caused a school bus to collide with a train last week?
</P>
<P>
   Officials are investigating the crash that killed three
elementary school students and injured four. It occurred near the
Georgia-Tennessee line. It was the worst train-bus crash involving
Georgians since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   A 33-car freight train slammed into the Murray County school bus
and dragged part of it down the track.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the school bus driver did not stop at the unguarded
rural railroad crossing, federal officials say. The AM/FM radio was
on, too, and people were talking, they say. Investigators aren't
sure if the noise could have prevented the bus driver from hearing
the train's whistle. Trees along the track may have prevented the
driver from seeing the train, they say.The investigation was
continuing .

   CUSTODY
</P>
<P>
   Will Elian's father arrive?
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez's father last week asked to visit the United
States and stay until a U.S. appeals court decides whether the
6-year-old should remain with relatives in Miami or return to Cuba
with his father. The father has been fighting for the boy's return
for months.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when the father would arrive in America.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Elian was found clinging to a raft off the coast of
Florida. His mother had drowned bringing him to the United States
from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials meeting with Elian's Miami relatives want them to
agree to turn the boy over to his father if the appeals court
decides Elian should leave. So far, the family hasn't agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Vice President Al Gore urged Congress to pass
legislation allowing all of Elian's relatives in Cuba to come to
the United States and live here permanently.

   MORE OIL
</P>
<P>
   Gas prices may drop
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed
last week to raise oil production.
</P>
<P>
   That should cause the price of oil to drop. Because gasoline is
made from oil, its price also should drop.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 11 nations that are OPEC members have agreed to
increase production by 1.45 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton expects the price of gas to drop
</P>
<P>
   11 to 18 cents a gallon by late summer.

   After threatening mountainside villages for four days, Mount Usu
erupted last week in Japan. It spewed a mixture of rock, gas and
ash over the snowy countryside. Experts had predicted the eruption
because of increased shaking of the earth. More than 11,000 people
had to leave their homes. As of Friday, there were no injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Experts had predicted the eruption because of increased seismic
activity that began earlier this week. The evacuation of more than
11,000 people began Wednesday. Kikuya said that there were no
injuries reported in Date.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most eruption-prone countries, with
86 active volcanoes.

 &HT;    Get wired without a PC
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Want to check your e-mail but don't have time to fire
up the computer? Check it on your cell phone or from the dashboard
of your car.
</P>
<P>
   Need some sports scores but left your laptop in your trunk?
Punch a few buttons on your Web wristwatch and you're online in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   With the escalating consumer clamor for easy e-mail and
user-friendly online access, technology companies have been racing
to develop more and more methods for connecting to the Web without
a clunky computer. These new gadgets are appealing to two markets:
Techno-savvy users who want on-the-go Internet and people
uncomfortable with PCs who just want a taste of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``As computers become easier to use, there's still some level of
technology that's beyond most people,'' says Scott Testa with
Mindbridge.com, a company that creates Web-based software.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want simple devices that don't do everything but do two
or three simple tasks very easily,'' says Testa. ``You're going to
see the computer, the TV, the telephone morph into these devices. A
typical house may have one computer, one of these appliances and a
TV with Net access.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Consumer Electronics Association's International Show in
Las Vegas in early January, the products that generated the most
oohs and aahs were these so-called Internet appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an explosion in these kinds of devices,'' says
CEA's Jeff Joseph. ``More and more people want Web access without
having to be tied to a desktop computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``best of show'' honors went to InfoGear's iPhone, a $399
gadget complete with a touch screen, keyboard and software that
lets users communicate by phone and e-mail, and access the Internet
_ including both banking and shopping online.
</P>
<P>
   The iPhone has been around since 1998 but has gone through a
half-dozen upgrades since then, based on customer feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new Net appliances are geared toward the
techno-shy. Products like MailStation ($99.95 and up) and MailBug
($129.95) are countertop devices that let you have e-mail without
the price and complexity of a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that there are so many folks who are so intimidated
by PCs. They want e-mail but have no need or interest in learning
how to operate a PC,'' says MailBug's Bryan McCormick. He quotes
statistics: 50 percent of American households don't have a PC, but
93 percent have a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think e-mail should be as ubiquitous as the telephone, and
it will never happen if it's dependent on something as complicated
as a computer,'' says McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   Another device generating a lot of buzz is the i-opener from
Netpliance. Resembling a slimmed-down computer, the device offers
easy e-mail and Internet access with a flat-panel screen and
keyboard. Retailing at $199, the i-opener promises to be up and
working within five minutes after it arrives at your door.
</P>
<P>
   For James Bond types, Casio even offers a wristwatch that lets
you exchange data with your PC.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of this technology is fairly new, many people have
been surfing without a computer for some time on WebTV. For more
than three years, WebTV has offered subscribers the ability to surf
the Net and send e-mail from the comfort of their recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Now in 1 million homes, WebTV ($99-$199) offers a range of
possibilities _ like creating Web pages and playing along with
Interactive TV programs. According to WebTV customer demographics
information, nearly three-quarters of all WebTV subscribers don't
own a computer; more than half have no prior Internet experience.
</P>
<P>
   The technology that allows e-mail and Net surfing isn't limited
to stand-alone appliances like TV sets and phones, however. A
company called Planetweb makes Internet software that goes into
non-computer consumer electronics. Currently, that technology is
available in the home video game, Sega Dreamcast ($199), letting
game players go online, using their TV set as a computer screen,
their remote control as a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Planetweb Internet browser will start appearing
on some new DVD players _ called iDVDs. It will allow viewers to go
online and check movie reviews, program guides and more before
watching a show. The price of the iDVD will depend on the company
that uses the technology, says Planetweb spokesman Jim Wallace. So
far, Aiwa is on board.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their out-of-the-box cost, all of these new
Internet appliances require an Internet connection. If you already
have an Internet service provider, there's no additional cost for
most. If you're not already plugged in, you can either choose your
own ISP or take advantage of special deals that most of the
manufacturers provide. The monthly access fee is often $10 or so _
usually half of what the major ISPs charge per month.
</P>
<P>
   While many of these products are already available, some are
still on the drawing board. Some auto manufacturers, for example,
are working on built-in hands-free e-mail retrieval from the
comfort of your car. While you're driving, you can check e-mail
messages and even answer them using voice-recognition capabilities.
(Sounds an awful lot like voice mail!)
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works are boom boxes that would have wireless
connections to the Internet. You could download MP3 files right
into your boom box and play them instantly on the go.
</P>
<P>
   These products apparently aren't so far-fetched. Industry
analysts agree that Net appliances are the hot techo-gadgets du
jour.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I need a computer to surf the Web is like saying I need
a computer to talk on the phone,'' says Internet expert and author
Mark Minasi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We geeks thought the way the world would get wired was that
everybody would grow smart and techy. We were wrong. The products
just got simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   Minasi likens these Net appliances to the traditional telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid we had one phone. Now we have them all over
the house,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years from now _ maybe less _ every room in the house
will have Internet access. This is coming so fast you can't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Agrees the CEA's Joseph, ``We have met the Jetsons and they are
us.''

 &HT;    Captain Pilkey Reveals All
 &HT;    By Julie Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dav Pilkey, author of the wacky and best-selling
``Captain Underpants'' books, only does interviews by e-mail. But
News for Kids figured that was better than nothing, and we were
right. Pilkey, who is 34, lives in Seattle with his dog named
Little Dog (what else?). Pilkey sent responses to our questions in
a flash.
</P>
<P>
   After we invited readers to call in with questions for Pilkey,
we got more than 140 calls in just two days. We sent Pilkey the
most common questions, plus a few others.
</P>
<P>
   NFK: Is your real name Dav?
</P>
<P>
   DP: My real name is David. I shortened it to Dav many years ago
when I worked at Pizza Hut. They were making a name tag for me, but
the letter ``e'' on the label-maker was broken. Instead of printing
``Dave,'' it printed ``Dav.'' The name stuck!
</P>
<P>
   NFK: How did you get the idea for Captain Underpants?
</P>
<P>
   DP: I invented Captain Underpants back when I was in the second
grade. I was the ``class clown'' and got in trouble constantly for
making my friends laugh. To punish me, my teacher would send me out
into the hallway. I had a lot of spare time out there in the hall,
so I began making my own comic books about a superhero named
Captain Underpants.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, my second-grade teacher gave me the inspiration.
She happened to use the word ``underpants'' in class one day, and
everybody laughed. She got mad and said, ``Underwear is NOT
funny!''
</P>
<P>
   This only made us laugh harder. At that moment, I discovered
that underwear was a powerful thing _ not only could it make my
friends laugh, but it could also make my teacher very angry. What
fun!
</P>
<P>
   NFK: Why do you like talking about toilets and other nasty
stuff?
</P>
<P>
   DP: I always liked mild ``potty humor'' when I was a kid. I
still think it's funny.
</P>
<P>
   NFK: Where did you get the name ``Professor Poopypants''? And
did you base that character on one of your own teachers?
</P>
<P>
   DP: The name ``Professor Poopypants'' just came to me one day
when I was walking my dog. I giggled the whole way home. He's not
based on any of my former teachers, though. Any resemblance to any
actual person, living or dead, is entirely unintentional (and
unfortunate).
</P>
<P>
   NFK: Are any of the characters in your ``Captain Underpants''
books based on real people you've known?
</P>
<P>
   DP: The principal, Mr. Krupp, is based on two really mean
principals I had growing up. George and Harold's gym teacher, Mr.
Meaner, was based on EVERY gym teacher I ever had when I was a kid
(they were all pure evil). That's why the gym teacher always gets
attacked (but nobody seems to care) in all of George and Harold's
comic books.
</P>
<P>
   NFK: What's your fifth ``Captain Underpants'' book? When will it
come out?
</P>
<P>
   DP: ``Captain Underpants and the Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie
Woman'' will probably come out in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   NFK: So WHO is the Wicked Wedgie Woman?
</P>
<P>
   DP: It's a secret ... but it's somebody we already know!
</P>
<P>
   NFK: Do you personally wear briefs or boxers, and why?
</P>
<P>
   DP: Actually, I wear boxer briefs. They're the best of both
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   These extra questions will be placed in the lesson plan online:
</P>
<P>
   NFK: What does your mom think about Captain Underpants?
</P>
<P>
   DP: My mom (and dad) weren't too crazy about Captain Underpants.
They liked the fact that I was being creative and drawing comic
books, but they didn't like the ``potty humor.'' So they encouraged
me to make comics about another super hero I had invented called
``Water Man.'' But Water Man wasn't as silly as Captain Underpants,
but I still had fun making up stories about him.
</P>
<P>
   NFK: How many ``Captain Underpants'' books do you plan to write
in your entire career?
</P>
<P>
   DP: Right now I think there will be eight books. But I might
write others if I come up with more good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   NFK: Are there any plans or contracts for a ``Captain
Underpants'' movie or TV series?
</P>
<P>
   DP: No. I get offers all the time, but I want ``Captain
Underpants'' to just be books for right now.

 &HT;    Movies may come to a computer screen near you
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Academy Awards last week focused America's
attention on the movies. But there may come a day when movies
aren't confined to the theater, VCR or DVD.
</P>
<P>
   There's a real move toward the Internet. As high-speed access
becomes more common, some experts think that movies will be
available for viewing in real time on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The April edition of Yahoo magazine takes a look at that trend
and predicts that ``when bandwidth and signal quality get better _
and they're getting better fast _ more users will be willing to
watch a movie on their computer screens.''
</P>
<P>
   Many problems, quality and broadband aside, remain.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, will people want to watch a big movie on such a
small screen?
</P>
<P>
   While computer monitor sizes have grown, the best of them don't
approach the size of the average TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting twist that may help studios market these
movies-over-the-Internet is the fact that some studios may use the
marketing ploy of either releasing the movies first on the Net, or
making the Net version available as soon as the movie is released _
beating VCR and DVD versions to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   'WHO GIVES A GIGABYTE?'
</P>
<P>
   The book is called a ``survival guide for the technologically
perplexed'' but it's really an entertaining and well-researched
guide to the new technologies that seem to be popping up faster
than normal people can cope.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you've learned what one set of initials stands for,
the next appears.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Who Gives a Gigbyte?,'' isn't confined to computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes a look at alternative energy sources and their
importance in a world that runs on oil and gas, and the
implications of altering genes in an effort to build the perfect
tomato.
</P>
<P>
   The book sells for $16.95 and is published by John Wiley &AMP; Sons.
It should be available now in most large bookstores as well as from
online sources.
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S GOING TO BE A REVOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   Music is a driving force on the Internet and there's a new
magazine called Revolution that will soon be hitting newsstands
with its premier spring edition.
</P>
<P>
   It's slick and upscale and will emphasize the high-tech aspects
of music. For instance, the first edition of the magazine will look
at the best MP3 music on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution will be a gadget-lovers' dream, including coverage of
the latest players and also the best of the conventional amplifiers
and other stereo equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Playing off that high-tech nature, each edition of the magazine
will contain a CD of some of the best of the new music.
</P>
<P>
   The first CD will include tunes from Kenlou such as ``Voodoo
Princess'' and ``Axus' My Planet Rocks.''

 &HT;    Tourism takes its toll
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMPEII, Italy _ In 62 A.D. it was devastated by an earthquake.
In 79 A.D., it was buried in an avalanche of hot ash from Mount
Vesuvius. Now, 2,000 years later, Pompeii is being destroyed again
_ a victim of its own popularity, creeping neglect and generations
of archaeologists more interested in digging up the past than
preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty centuries after the city died, its cobblestone streets
are still furrowed by the tracks of Roman chariots. The House of
Amorini Doriati and the open shops and public baths along the Via
dell'Abbondaza look eerily like the people of Pompeii just stepped
out for a few minutes and never came back.
</P>
<P>
   Red painted signs on the shop walls advertise an upcoming
gladitorial contest at the amphitheater _ alongside the political
slogans for an election that was never held. Murals of undraped
women in the brothel on the Vico del Lupanare still bear the
graffiti of lovers _ ``Victor with Athena'' among them _ who used
its rooms in Roman times.
</P>
<P>
   Walking the streets of Pompeii in early morning, before the tour
buses disgorge their streams of humanity, leaves one with an uneasy
feeling, more akin to an invasion of privacy than a visit to one of
the world's best-known archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   As a time capsule of everyday life at the height of the Roman
Empire, Pompeii is unique. But its problems are tragically similar
to those that plague hundreds of archaeological sites around the
world, from the tombs in Egypt's Valley of the Kings to the
prehistoric Anazasi pueblos of the Western United States.
</P>
<P>
   As the oldest archaeological site in the world, Pompeii provides
an unsettling glimpse of what can happen when the past is unearthed
with no plan for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ruins were discovered in 1748, more than two-thirds of
the 163 acres within the city's walls have been unearthed. Block by
block, Italian, French, British and American archaeologists have
peeled away the 30-foot-deep layer of volcanic ash, leaving a city
virtually unchanged from that August day in 79 A.D. when it was
buried.
</P>
<P>
   PRESERVATION WOULD BE COSTLY
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 1,500 of Pompeii's buildings and 215,000 square
feet of frescoed walls, resplendent with everything from a Venus in
a seashell to portraits of the city's rich and famous, stand
exposed. To the sun. To the rain. To fast-growing vines. And to 2
million visitors whose fascination with the ruins is hastening
their destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pompeii is headed for an unprecedented crisis,'' says Pietro
Giovanni Guzzo, the superintendent of archaeology for Pompeii.
``The rate of deterioration of ancient structures is increasing.
And there is no reason to assume that this deterioration can be
slowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzzo estimates that saving Pompeii from further ruin and
correcting the centuries of neglect could cost $300 million. Fading
frescoes need to be covered. Walls need to be shored up. Leaky
roofs need to be replaced. Last year, the Italian government
finally agreed to let the local authority that manages the ruins
site keep the revenue its collects from visitors. But because
turnstile receipts _ about $9 million a year _ must also pay for
salaries, advertising and other expenses, the move is more of a
Band-Aid than a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are acres and acres of Pompeii excavated in the 18th and
19th century that are already beyond rescue,'' says Andrew
Wallace-Hadrill of the British School in Rome, which is working to
determine what can be salvaged. ``It is deteriorating rapidly.
Whole buildings are overgrown. No paint is left on many of the
walls and an alarming number of the walls themselves are on the
verge of collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been compounded by well-intentioned but inept
restoration efforts. Throughout the city, the modern concrete used
to shore up Roman walls is crumbling faster than the originals.
Steel beams used to support sagging ceilings are rusting through.
And scores of tile mosaics restored in the 1970s have been
destroyed by leaking water.

   More visitors would yield more revenue for restoration. But the
hordes of visitors who troop through the streets and homes of
Pompeii _ chipping off pieces of Roman mosaics for souvenirs,
scraping away the fragile frescoes, and carving their initials atop
2,000-year-old graffiti _ are a part of the problem too.
</P>
<P>
   TOURISM'S NEGATIVE IMPACT MULTIPLIED
</P>
<P>
   As the ruins have deteriorated, officials have roped off whole
blocks of the city. Only 14 houses _ and less than 25 percent of
the ruins _ are now open to the public. But as ever-increasing
numbers of visitors have been herded into an ever-smaller space,
their impact has been multiplied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look there. It is happening right before our eyes,'' says an
agitated Matia Bourgiono, a conservator for Pompeii's
Superintendenza, which manages the site, as he shows off the
brilliantly colored frescoes adorning the house of Aulus Vettius
Restitutus, one of Pompeii's wealthiest residents at the time of
Vesuvius' eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Wagging a finger, Bourgiono chides a teenager for leaning up
against an aging fresco with her backpack. Sheepishly, she moves
on. Within moments, she has been replaced by two boys who can't
resist running their hands over the mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to find new ways to protect Pompeii from this
barbarian invasion _ more guards, infrared detectors coupled to
alarms,'' Bourgiono explains. ``But we have so much to defend, we
can't stop it all. It's hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   At a growing number of the world's ancient monuments,
authorities echo similar feelings of helplessness _ caught between
a rising tide of international tourism and a desire to preserve
ruins of the past for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archaeological tourism is wonderful, but like tourism in
general, it is growing more rapidly than we ever thought it
would,'' says Kent Weeks, director of archaeology at the American
University in Cairo, who has been watching an unfolding crisis in
Egypt's Valley of the Kings. ``We weren't ready for it. Now it is
desperation time.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day tour buses deliver 3,000 to 4,000 visitors to the
valley, home to the tombs of Tutankhamen, Ramses the Great and
other pharaohs of Egypt's New Kingdom, which dates from the 15th to
the 10th centuries B.C. On days when the cruise ships are in, that
number of visitors may swell to 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these tombs have narrow corridors and limited space,''
says Weeks. ``The plaster and paintings have been worn completely
off in some places from touching and tapping. After being sealed
and dry for thousands of years, just the presence of so many people
breathing in such a confined space is accelerating the
deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, as Egyptian authorities were planning to sacrifice one
of the valley's lesser-known tombs to make room for a parking lot,
Weeks and his team decided to map it before it was destroyed. In
the process, they discovered the ``lost tomb'' built for the sons
of Ramses II, a sprawling 100-room complex that is now one of the
valley's most important sites.
</P>
<P>
   EGYPT LOOKS TO EASE THE CRUSH
</P>
<P>
   Each new discovery, however, brings more people. To ease
congestion, authorities are planning an access control system _
complete with red, green and yellow lights _ that will steer
visitors to less visited tombs. With such improvements, the
government hopes to triple the tourism, to 25,000 people a day over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like trying to hold a New Year's Eve party
for 1,000 people in a one-bedroom apartment,'' says Weeks. ``Doing
it without doing major damage is going to require some careful and
creative planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Egyptian sites are under pressure, too. This year's
Paris-to-Dakar road rally left such a mountain of trash at the
Great Pyramids near Cairo that the government filed a formal
complaint against the race's sponsors. Only last year, the
government banned camel rides from the pyramids because they were
polluting the trails.
</P>
<P>
   No ancient ruins are entirely immune to the pressures.
</P>
<P>
   _ The monuments of ancient Greece, architectural masterpieces
that have endured 2,500 years of war and looting, now face more
insidious forces. Until recently, visitors to the Acropolis could
wander through the Parthenon and other temples atop the sacred rock
of Athens. Today, thanks to years of vandalism, structural problems
and seemingly endless restoration efforts, they can only stroll
outside of the marble monuments. The bedrock is worn smooth from
the feet of more than 1 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dark stains on the marble are from air pollution,'' says
Nikos Toganidis, the architect in charge of restoring the
Parthenon. ``We can coat the marble with a solution of asbestos,
but it will only last for a few years before it needs to be
redone.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In England, visitors are now barred from the interior of
Stonehenge, the enigmatic circle of stones that has stood in the
Wiltshire countryside for 5,000 years. The massive stone monument,
whose origins are uncertain, now lies 100 yards from a major
highway and is surrounded by parking lots, gift shops and ice cream
stands. In an effort to restore at least some of Stonehenge's
magic, the British government has pledged itself to an eight-year,
$200 million program to reroute the highway and clear the
surrounding landscape of 20th century development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even China's 2,000-year old terra cotta army _ the life-sized
statues of Qin dynasty soldiers that were unearthed in 1974 _ are
victims of their own popularity. The soldiers, which once guarded
an underground mausoleum, are being defaced with nine different
kinds of mold that authorities blame on too many people crowding
into the building that now houses them.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Peru, the government wants to double the number of tourists
who visit the ruins of Machu Picchu by building a cable car to
replace the 25-minute drive on a dirt road. It's not a popular
plan. ``Machu Picchu should not be reduced to a place where
thousands of people rush through, spending 15 minutes to capture
something on their camcorders,'' says Patricia Uribe, the Peruvian
director for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, which lists the Inca ruins as one of the
world's leading heritage sites. ``It's like taking a fine
restaurant and serving fast food inside it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the problems confronting ancient monuments, however,
can be pinned on tourists and the governments that want to attract
them.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hiram Bingham, the explorer who put Machu Picchu on the map
the minute he christened it ``the lost city of the Incas,''
discoverers themselves are sometimes part of the problem.
Archaeologists keep finding interesting new things. And digging
them up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pompeii's obvious and critical problems, for instance,
the Italian Ministry of Culture this year will sponsor new
excavation there and at nearby Herculaneum, a smaller city buried
by Vesuvius' eruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a kind of Indiana Jones attitude about archaeology in
this country,'' says Wallace-Hadrill. ``Everybody knows there's a
lot of civilization waiting to be discovered and they can't wait to
dig it up. But until we catch up with what is already exposed, we
shouldn't be spending so much on new excavation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Elia, Boston University archaeologist and vice president
for professional responsibility for the Archaeological Institute of
America, says it's an all-too-familiar problem. ``In archaeology,
it's easy to get grants to dig things up. It's glamorous. It's
adventurous,'' he says. ``Trying to save something that's already
been dug up just doesn't have the same cachet. Any place you expose
ancient architecture, it begins to melt away, but until recently,
we have failed to educate archaeologists about the need to manage
sites after they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   SOME SITES BEING COVERED UP AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, archaeologists seeking to excavate in Greece,
the Middle East and some Latin American countries have been
required to set aside a portion of their budgets to care for the
site once they are finished. At some newly excavated sites, drastic
measures are sometimes needed. Archaeologists are simply covering
them up again.
</P>
<P>
   In central China, government archaeologists last year unearthed
the oldest known altar used for state religion. The 1,500-year-old,
26-foot-high circular structure is thought to have been used by at
least 17 Chinese emperors. But because they had no money to support
a public display of the discovery, scientists studied the site
carefully and then _ only 30 days after it was discovered _ covered
it up again to protect it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For endangered archaeological sites, reburial is definitely a
technique whose time has come,'' says Martha Dimas, an
archaeologist at the Getty Conservation Institute in Malibu,
Calif., which is working to save archaeological sites in dozens of
countries. ``In some cases, it is the only way to save these sites
for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The deterioration of exposed archaeological sites is a major
problem in the United States, too. At dozens of national parks in
the West, prehistoric ruins are crumbling for many of the same
reasons that Pompeii is falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the major ruins were excavated early in this
century,'' says Al Remley, an archaeologist with the National Park
Service in Flagstaff, Ariz. ``They were opened up to the public in
the 1920s and 1930s, but visitation didn't really explode until the
1960s. Now they are deteriorating rapidly and we don't have the
money to keep them up.''
</P>
<P>
   To address the problem, the park service has begun its Vanishing
Treasure Program, which has so far committed $4 million to
restoration and conservation of ruins in a total of 40 Western
parks. It's a start, but Remley says at the current rate of
funding, it will take 15 years to finish what had been intended to
take 10 years and cost $60 million. In the meantime, in some parks
the government is resorting to what some officials say may be the
only way to save some ruins. They're being covered up again.
</P>
<P>
   At Chaco Canyon, N.M., one of the largest 1,000-year-old Anasazi
pueblos, the 600-room complex called Chetro Ketl, has been
partially reburied for its own protection.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the ruination of ruins goes virtually unnoticed. The
1,100-year-old Indian mounds of Ocmulgee National Monument in
Macon, Ga., for instance, are the region's most popular tourist
attraction, but the park's most interesting feature _ the only
surviving spiral mound in North America _ has been neglected for
decades because the park has no money to maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if 1,000 people who visit the park a year ever see
it,'' says Ocmulgee Superintendent James David. ``To get to it you
have to hike a mile and a half and wade across a stream. There used
to be a bridge, but it's gone now. Once you get there, it's hard
even to see it because it's so overgrown with trees and brush.''
</P>
<P>
   As neglect and overuse erode traces of the past _ from the
ancestral Creek culture of middle Georgia to the glory that was
Rome _ archaeologists acknowledge that their own profession has
sometimes failed in what many consider its most sacred obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just shoveling away is not what archaeology is about,'' says
Wallace-Hadrill. ``Archaeology is the process of interrogating the
past, interpreting the remains and telling others what has been
found. Whole blocks of Pompeii have been excavated without any
effort to report what was found. Now the physical evidence is gone,
and the information is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston University archaeologist Phillip King is trying to do
something about it. As the director of the White-Levy Program for
Archaeological Publications, King is helping to resurrect the
records of ``dead digs'' _ research that was never published.
</P>
<P>
   With $2 million in grants from New York art patrons Shelby White
and Leon Levy, King has helped interested researchers reopen the
books on at least 45 lost excavations that have languished in
archaeological limbo for a half-century or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archaeologists like to dig,'' says King. ``Some of them do not
like to publish.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the program's achievements was the publication of
60-year-old records from a site in Israel called Megiddo, which
Christians believe is Armageddon, the place described in the Bible
as the scene of the climactic battle between good and evil on
Judgment Day.
</P>
<P>
   The site was excavated by the University of Chicago in the
1930s, but it was only last year that a missing collection of
records revealed that what scholars had assumed was a period of
quiet in Megiddo's turbulent history _ around 1,000 B.C. _ was
wracked by violent upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence isn't likely to unravel the long-held notions
about Armageddon, but archaeologists say it underscores the need
for the profession to publish what it has unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is cases like that that show why we have a moral obligation
to publish,'' says King. ``Once an archaeologist moves a stone, he
destroys any information it might impart. If people don't know what
you've found, it might as well be buried in your basement.''

 &HT;    Tourism takes its toll

<TEXT>
<P>
   POMPEII, Italy _ In 62 A.D. it was devastated by an earthquake.
In 79 A.D., it was buried in an avalanche of hot ash from Mount
Vesuvius. Now, 2,000 years later, Pompeii is being destroyed again
_ a victim of its own popularity, creeping neglect and generations
of archaeologists more interested in digging up the past than
preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty centuries after the city died, its cobblestone streets
are still furrowed by the tracks of Roman chariots. The House of
Amorini Doriati and the open shops and public baths along the Via
dell'Abbondaza look eerily like the people of Pompeii just stepped
out for a few minutes and never came back.
</P>
<P>
   Red painted signs on the shop walls advertise an upcoming
gladitorial contest at the amphitheater _ alongside the political
slogans for an election that was never held. Murals of undraped
women in the brothel on the Vico del Lupanare still bear the
graffiti of lovers _ ``Victor with Athena'' among them _ who used
its rooms in Roman times.
</P>
<P>
   Walking the streets of Pompeii in early morning, before the tour
buses disgorge their streams of humanity, leaves one with an uneasy
feeling, more akin to an invasion of privacy than a visit to one of
the world's best-known archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   As a time capsule of everyday life at the height of the Roman
Empire, Pompeii is unique. But its problems are tragically similar
to those that plague hundreds of archaeological sites around the
world, from the tombs in Egypt's Valley of the Kings to the
prehistoric Anazasi pueblos of the Western United States.
</P>
<P>
   As the oldest archaeological site in the world, Pompeii provides
an unsettling glimpse of what can happen when the past is unearthed
with no plan for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ruins were discovered in 1748, more than two-thirds of
the 163 acres within the city's walls have been unearthed. Block by
block, Italian, French, British and American archaeologists have
peeled away the 30-foot-deep layer of volcanic ash, leaving a city
virtually unchanged from that August day in 79 A.D. when it was
buried.
</P>
<P>
   PRESERVATION WOULD BE COSTLY
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 1,500 of Pompeii's buildings and 215,000 square
feet of frescoed walls, resplendent with everything from a Venus in
a seashell to portraits of the city's rich and famous, stand
exposed. To the sun. To the rain. To fast-growing vines. And to 2
million visitors whose fascination with the ruins is hastening
their destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pompeii is headed for an unprecedented crisis,'' says Pietro
Giovanni Guzzo, the superintendent of archaeology for Pompeii.
``The rate of deterioration of ancient structures is increasing.
And there is no reason to assume that this deterioration can be
slowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzzo estimates that saving Pompeii from further ruin and
correcting the centuries of neglect could cost $300 million. Fading
frescoes need to be covered. Walls need to be shored up. Leaky
roofs need to be replaced. Last year, the Italian government
finally agreed to let the local authority that manages the ruins
site keep the revenue its collects from visitors. But because
turnstile receipts _ about $9 million a year _ must also pay for
salaries, advertising and other expenses, the move is more of a
Band-Aid than a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are acres and acres of Pompeii excavated in the 18th and
19th century that are already beyond rescue,'' says Andrew
Wallace-Hadrill of the British School in Rome, which is working to
determine what can be salvaged. ``It is deteriorating rapidly.
Whole buildings are overgrown. No paint is left on many of the
walls and an alarming number of the walls themselves are on the
verge of collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been compounded by well-intentioned but inept
restoration efforts. Throughout the city, the modern concrete used
to shore up Roman walls is crumbling faster than the originals.
Steel beams used to support sagging ceilings are rusting through.
And scores of tile mosaics restored in the 1970s have been
destroyed by leaking water.
</P>
<P>
   More visitors would yield more revenue for restoration. But the
hordes of visitors who troop through the streets and homes of
Pompeii _ chipping off pieces of Roman mosaics for souvenirs,
scraping away the fragile frescoes, and carving their initials atop
2,000-year-old graffiti _ are a part of the problem too.
</P>
<P>
   TOURISM'S NEGATIVE IMPACT MULTIPLIED

   As the ruins have deteriorated, officials have roped off whole
blocks of the city. Only 14 houses _ and less than 25 percent of
the ruins _ are now open to the public. But as ever-increasing

</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the ruination of ruins goes virtually unnoticed. The
1,100-year-old Indian mounds of Ocmulgee National Monument in
Macon, Ga., for instance, are the region's most popular tourist
attraction, but the park's most interesting feature _ the only
surviving spiral mound in North America _ has been neglected for
decades because the park has no money to maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if 1,000 people who visit the park a year ever see
it,'' says Ocmulgee Superintendent James David. ``To get to it you
have to hike a mile and a half and wade across a stream. There used
to be a bridge, but it's gone now. Once you get there, it's hard
even to see it because it's so overgrown with trees and brush.''
</P>
<P>
   As neglect and overuse erode traces of the past _ from the
ancestral Creek culture of middle Georgia to the glory that was
Rome _ archaeologists acknowledge that their own profession has
sometimes failed in what many consider its most sacred obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just shoveling away is not what archaeology is about,'' says
Wallace-Hadrill. ``Archaeology is the process of interrogating the
past, interpreting the remains and telling others what has been
found. Whole blocks of Pompeii have been excavated without any
effort to report what was found. Now the physical evidence is gone,
and the information is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston University archaeologist Phillip King is trying to do
something about it. As the director of the White-Levy Program for
Archaeological Publications, King is helping to resurrect the
records of ``dead digs'' _ research that was never published.
</P>
<P>
   With $2 million in grants from New York art patrons Shelby White
and Leon Levy, King has helped interested researchers reopen the
books on at least 45 lost excavations that have languished in
archaeological limbo for a half-century or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archaeologists like to dig,'' says King. ``Some of them do not
like to publish.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the program's achievements was the publication of
60-year-old records from a site in Israel called Megiddo, which
Christians believe is Armageddon, the place described in the Bible
as the scene of the climactic battle between good and evil on
Judgment Day.
</P>
<P>
   The site was excavated by the University of Chicago in the
1930s, but it was only last year that a missing collection of
records revealed that what scholars had assumed was a period of
quiet in Megiddo's turbulent history _ around 1,000 B.C. _ was
wracked by violent upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence isn't likely to unravel the long-held notions
about Armageddon, but archaeologists say it underscores the need
for the profession to publish what it has unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is cases like that that show why we have a moral obligation
to publish,'' says King. ``Once an archaeologist moves a stone, he
destroys any information it might impart. If people don't know what
you've found, it might as well be buried in your basement.''

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My father-in-law has recently been diagnosed with terminal
lung cancer. His medical expenses have become astronomical. The
main cause of his cancer is his 25 years of smoking, and I wonder
if he would be eligible to receive any of the Texas tobacco lawsuit
money for medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ R.J.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``No,'' says Andrea Horton, spokeswoman for the attorney
general. The state will receive more than $15 billion over 25
years. An additional $2.2 billion will be set aside for political
subdivisions within the state. According to Megan Haley, with the
Texas Department of Health, lawmakers so far have appointed some of
the money for endowments whose interest earnings will pay for
medical research, anti-smoking campaigns and smoking cessation
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was recently in the Middle East and bought some saffron
stamens for much less than they cost here. I was told I could
freeze them, so I bought enough to last for years, but I'm not sure
how to package them for freezing. What should I do?
</P>
<P>
   _ Sharon McCathern
</P>
<P>
   A: Is it completely dry? Nancy Levy, a local apothecary, says
you do not have to freeze the saffron. Freezers are humid places
and moisture is an herb's enemy. (A three-day stint will kill any
bugs however.) Only the saffron's stigmas are used. Place them in
an air-tight glass container away from direct sunlight. The saffron
should last at least seven years, adds Levy. Be very careful with
your stash. Saffron is an expensive spice _ it sells for $7 a gram
(more than $3,000 a pound).
</P>
<P>
   Q: The 2000 census forms say we cannot put our college student
on the form. How, then, are students counted? Ours goes to school
out of state, and if the census is used to get more representation
in Congress we lose out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pam D. A: Census 2000 will count people at their usual
residence (college), the place where they live and sleep most of
the time. This place is not necessarily the same as a voting
residence, legal residence or permanent residence (your house).
Leslie Lawson of the census says that if your children don't live
in the house but live in institutionalized college housing, such as
a dorm, the census works with the administrators to prepare a
special student form. If they live in a apartment or a house, they
will fill out their own census form.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I don't think we were counted in the 1990 census. Can we find
out? We never received a census form, but we got several postcards
asking us to return one. _ T.R. Rogers A: You can find out for a
fee if you were counted. The Census Bureau Age Search Service has
information from 1910 to 1990 that can be obtained by downloading a
BC-600 form through www.census.gov/genealogy/www or by calling
(812) 218-3046. The process takes three to four weeks and costs a
minimum of $40. You may request information about yourself or your
dependents. Often census information is requested by individuals
for Social Security or other retirement plans, for passports, to
prove relationship for estate purposes or in genealogical research.
The Census is confidential for 72 years _ individual 1990
information won't be available to the public until 2062. If you
don't receive a form this year, look for ``be counted'' sites.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The floor in my tiled shower is soooo slippery. I had the
stick-on daisies _ they got yucky, so I removed them. I tried a
rubber mat, but it kept slipping.
</P>
<P>
   _ C. White
</P>
<P>
   A: Give Skid-Tex by Bondex ($10.40) a try.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Years ago we found a company that would cut ``punt'' wine
bottles and make glasses. The drinking edge of the glass was
smoothed to eliminate the sharp edges. We have tried to find
someone who would be interested in doing this for us, but have been
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Malcolm Sanders
</P>
<P>
   A: Malcolm, you can do this yourself. Pick up a glass cutter.
Smooth the rim of the new glass with emery sandpaper from a
hardware store.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the best way to store money in the back yard? Would
it be in Tupperware or maybe a Mason jar?
</P>
<P>
   _B.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither is good. The Mason jar could break or crack, and the
Tupperware is meant for short-term food storage, not paper money.
It is not acid-free. If you must bury the greenbacks, use a
container that will protect the money from the elements, like time
capsules. These clear polymer cases will protect your investment.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying to locate an original Munchkin from ``The
Wizard of Oz'' who apparently lives in Round Rock, Texas. His name
is Clarence Swenson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heather Eaton
</P>
<P>
   A: Close. Swenson lives in Pflugerville, Texas. Mail him a
missive at 1701 Azores, Pflugerville, Texas 78660. Autographs are
available for a small fee. Each of the Munchkin actors was paid
less than Toto, Dorothy Gale's dog.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My fiancee and I have been searching for the boxing gloves
that Ally uses (occasionally) on ``Ally McBeal.'' They're the huge
gloves, obviously intended for stress relief, and not real boxing.
Could you help me find them, please?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark C.
</P>
<P>
   A: What price love? $250? These oversized boxing gloves are
available through Inflatable 2000 Amusement Products for $250 per
pair (plus shipping and handling). The foam gloves are obviously
for amusement purposes. To order call (888) INFL8-IT or visit
www.inflatable2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm kind of a ``Price is Right'' fan (don't tell my mom _ she
thinks I go to work every day) and am curious about the prizes the
contestants win. Do they pay taxes on their winnings, how is their
merchandise shipped and does the show ever follow up with the
winners who win trips?
</P>
<P>
   _ N.G.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: The longest-running game show in television history arranges
for a delivery service to transport the prizes. Cars, however, are
picked up at the local dealership. The taxman (IRS and sales)
cometh to all winners, of course. Trips are handled through a
travel agency, and the show does not followup with the contestant.
</P>
<P>
   UPSHOT/UPDATE/UPROAR: Do you have catagelophobia, or
katagelophobia, a fear of being ridiculed, or perhaps
erythrophobia, erytophobia or ereuthophobia, fear of blushing or
the color red? Then April Fools Day is not for you. Stay in, lest
you develop ophthalmophobia, a fear of being stared at, or
geliophobia a fear of laughter. Contact Jane Greig at P.O. Box 670,
Austin, TX 78767; (512) 445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com or
fax (512) 445-3968.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ This morning, by popular demand and in
accordance with Village Ordinance 2791-3 (enacted to keep ugliness
off the streets), I went to the beauty parlor. It was a bust. The
hair came out okay, but it made the rest of me look bad. I keep
telling Karen it must be the lights. I've begged her to ditch the
daylight fluorescents and screw in some of those nice pink bulbs _
the ones that softly shave 10 years off the face in the mirror. She
says if she did that, hair colors in our town would turn freaky _
fast. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ No matter how ugly the speech,
it's far worse for Congress to make a law that abridges the
public's free-speech rights. Since the Constitution forbids
Congress from making laws that abridge constitutional rights,
Congress members are trying to change the U.S. Constitution with an
amendment that allows them to ban burning the American flag.

   COXNET PTECH 0404 _ A high-tech community in Arizona is using a
sophisticated network to bring neighbors together. DC Ranch, with
200 homes occupied and another 6,000 slated for construction, has
made high-speed Internet connections a standard feature of the
houses it sells. Its quiet, cactus-studded streets and upscale
homes are wired with fiber optics and coaxial cable to provide each
household with at least two high-speed, ready-to-surf Internet
connections, six e-mail addresses, and digital TV and telephones _
all for $50 a month. (Holmes, Cox Washington Bureau) Art includes
an attractive 3-column color photo of a man working in his home and
a 1-column color photo of a computer and a big-screen television.

   GAME CORNER _ As many video games as have been made using the

LucasArts' new ``Star Wars'' game, Force Commander isn't it.
(Staff, Austin American-Statesman) Art includes 2-column color
photo from Force Commander.

   E-TRAVELER _ Wedding jitters? Ease your marital fears with a
trip to the Web. Here are some wedding-related Web that will have
you walking down the aisle in style. (Staff, Austin

car of honeymooners driving away with a computer hanging out of
their car.

   TECHNOBUDDY _ The smart way to buy computers is to treat a
computer system like a stereo outfit. Today you might buy a really

   SLAVE-RECORDS _ Driving to work in 1998, Eric Walther turned on
Allen Parkway in Houston and collided head-on with the past.
Construction workers at the Allen Parkway Village, a public housing
complex Walther passed every day, uncovered a cemetery where former
slaves were buried. For Walther, an associate professor of history
at the University of Houston, the find was poignant. ``I started
thinking there are hardly any physical remains of slavery in
Texas,'' he said. ``We find something and build right over it.''
Walther's desire to put a face on those who were denied their
humanity has blossomed into a project some consider impossible. He
wants to document every black slave who ever lived in Texas _ a
population he estimates at 250,000. (Roser, Austin

KATHLEEN TURNER BRINGS OUT NAKED TRUTH ABOUT LONDONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Wanna sell theater tickets?
</P>
<P>
   Get yer kit off!
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the lesson here in London's West End, the
Broadway of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the hottest play in the West End was ``The Blue
Room,'' David Hare's drama about sexual obsession, which received
enormous publicity, mostly for the fact that Nicole Kidman appeared
on stage naked. One critic famously described the Australian
actress's performance as ``theatrical Viagra.'' The play went on to
become a hit on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hottest ticket in town is for a stage adaptation of
``The Graduate,'' in which veteran Hollywood actress Kathleen
Turner plays the seductress Mrs. Robinson and, well, gets her kit
off, as the Brits say, playing the seduction scene in the nude.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales had been fair to middling when the show, which
opens Wednesday, went into previews last week. But once word got
around that Turner was taking to the floorboards at the Gielgud
Theatre wearing nothing but her talent, the show sold out its
three-month run in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   This despite the fact that, at 45, Kathleen Turner ain't no
Nicole Kidman. In the film ``Body Heat,'' Turner turned in one of
the most erotic performances of 1980s mainstream Hollywood, using
her sex appeal to get William Hurt's character to kill her husband.
But Turner is no longer the slinky temptress she played in ``Body
Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   She is, however, an accomplished actress, and perhaps more
importantly, a shrewd judge of what puts bums in seats, as the
Brits say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people learned that Kathleen appears nude, people went
mad, and the tickets just disappeared,'' said Hayley Burke, a
spokeswoman for the theater, who said the show has set the record
for advance sales by a dramatic play in the West End.
</P>
<P>
   Burke dismissed suggestions that the nude scene had been
included for commercial reasons. She said it is artful and in
keeping with writer-director Terry Johnson's adaptation of Charles
Webb's original novel, in which the protagonist Benjamin Braddock
gets seduced by the wife of his father's boss. Dustin Hoffman and
Anne Bancroft played the odd couple in the Oscar-winning film.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the decision to do the nude scene ``was very much a
mutual one'' between Turner and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   When he recently snatched up a string of West End theaters,
Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer-impresario behind ``Phantom of
the Opera'' and other enormously successful shows, said one of his
motives was to save London's stages from the bottom line, mostly
American owners who would be so profit-driven that they would put
on only safe, commercially successful, ``dumbed down'' fare.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plays on display in the West End these days are far
from conservative, but whether they are dumb is a matter of
opinion. At the Young Vic, for example, you can take in a
performance of ``The Man With The Absurdly Large Penis.'' At the
Gate, the show ``Cuckoos'' centers on a couple who become stuck
together while having anal sex. A serious play that took its name
from a profane reference to Franz Kafka's penis just wrapped up a
long run.
</P>
<P>
   There is a temptation to exaggerate here, to suggest that the
stiff-upper-lip Brits go a little nutty whenever they see a body
part that is normally clothed, that titillation is being used to
sell theater tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But as Fiachra Gibbons, the arts correspondent for The Guardian,
put it, the real revelation in ``The Blue Room'' for most audiences
was that Kidman, previously known for her film work and marriage to
Tom Cruise, could carry her own on stage. Gibbons said audiences
didn't leave the theater praising her body, but her acting. Preview
audiences have given Turner standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons also said that the only real extended commercial and
critical sensation in the West End in recent years was ``The
Weir,'' by the Irish playwright Conor McPherson, in which three
wistful bachelors tell ghost stories in a pub in the west of
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons is right. The London theater crowd remains a discerning
bunch, more likely to see something by Shaw, Wilde, Stoppard,
Beckett and Pinter than they are to sit next to tourists at ``The
Lion King'' or ``Mamma Mia,'' the wildly successful show about Abba
songs. Contemporary British playwrights, such as Michael Frayn and
Alan Bennett, produce consistently provocative plays that are both
critical and commercial successes.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is this: Put a naked woman on display, on
page three of a sensational tabloid or even the stage of a
venerable theater, and many Brits will line up with cash in hand.
</P>
<P>
   It seems only a matter of time before there's a West End revival
of ``Oh, Calcutta.''

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I plan to use a paint and varnish remover to strip the paint
and varnish off some old furniture that I have in my vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the strong odor and the potential mess, I will do
this work outside. But when I tried a job like this before, I had
trouble with the liquid remover drying too fast.
</P>
<P>
   What suggestions can you offer to make the job easier and faster
this time?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you use remover while working outside, make sure you do
not work in the sun as this makes the remover dry too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Use a thick, semi-paste type, not a liquid, and apply this in
heavy layers, brushing in one direction only _ not by brushing back
and forth. The idea is not to disturb the layer of remover any more
than necessary and thus keep it from drying out too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Allow the remover to soak long enough to soften the paint or
varnish all the way through (usually about 20-30 minutes), then
scrape the softened residue off with a dull putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   On carved or grooved surfaces use a wire brush with brass
bristle or a stiff scrub brush.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The ceiling in our master bathroom frequently develops dark,
rust colored spots after the shower has been used.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling is dry wall and has been painted several times with
a latex base satin enamel. The spots wash off with water, but they
come back after a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   We have a vent fan that exhausts into the attic and always have
this running when using the shower.
</P>
<P>
   Any idea as to what causes this, and what we can do about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is usually due to something in the paint or under the
paint that is activated by the moisture that seeps through when the
shower creates steam. This ``something'' is apparently leaching out
through the latex paint.
</P>
<P>
   It could be some type of size or other primer that was used in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   There is also another potential problem caused by your exhaust
fan blowing all that moisture up into the attic _ it should be
vented directly to the outside, not into the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Your problem can be solved by installing the duct work needed to
vent the exhaust fan to the outdoors and also scrubbing the ceiling
with a detergent to get all the stains out.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse with plain water and allow to dry for at least 24 hours,
then prime with an alkyd base primer or with a stain-killing sealer
such as BIN or Kilz.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A repair man recently spilled some asphalt roofing cement on
the concrete driveway in front of our house.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know how we can remove this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Asphalt roofing cement can usually be softened and dissolved
by soaking with gasoline or paint thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape off as much as you can, then pour a little of this
solvent over the stain and immediately cover with a heavy layer of
dry powdered Portland cement.
</P>
<P>
   Pour more solvent over the powder to saturate it and create a
thick paste, then cover the whole thing with a sheet of plastic (to
slow down evaporation).
</P>
<P>
   Let this soak in for several hours, and then sweep up the
powder. Repeat if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If a slight discoloration remains it is possible you can remove
this with a liquid driveway cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My toilet does not flush properly so I used a stiff wire to
clean out all the little holes around the underside of the rim at
the top of the porcelain bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This helped but not enough to make it flush properly.
</P>
<P>
   How can I clean out the channel inside this porcelain rim so
that the full effect of the flush water will run down into the
bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: When a toilet does not flush properly this is seldom the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is most likely with the flush tank's water level _
it does not fill up as high as it should so there is not enough
water and pressure for a thorough flush.
</P>
<P>
   This can be corrected by adjusting the ballcock or inlet valve
that controls the water level.
</P>
<P>
   If the porcelain channel you are talking about is really
blocked, then the bowl will have to be removed, turned upside down,
and then the channel flushed out with acid (not a do-it-yourself
job in my opinion).

 (Includes a color slide of Sarah Michelle Gellar in a scene from
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'') 
 By MICHAEL LOGAN  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not for release in Canada until 16 April. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah Michelle Gellar is the queen of contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   The star of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' who will turn 23 on
April 14, is one of Hollywood's most opinionated and outspoken
actresses _ yet also one of its most private.
</P>
<P>
   She is supremely focused and clearheaded _ yet speaks at warp
speed, rarely concluding one topic before hurling herself headlong
into the next.
</P>
<P>
   She is sweet yet sassy, insecure yet audaciously self-confident,
childlike yet wise beyond her years.
</P>
<P>
   A role model for millions of young people, Gellar is avidly
antidrug and almost puritanical in her morals, yet she's been known
to toss her convictions aside for movie roles _ she played a
coke-snorting villainess in ``Cruel Intentions'' (1999) _ and the
occasional fashion spread, such as the Rolling Stone cover for
which she posed in kinky red leather and brandished a whip.
</P>
<P>
   Gellar is, quite simply, one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a decision _ a rule, really _ when I was very young
that I would always stay true to myself,'' Gellar says over lunch
in her trailer near the ``Buffy'' set. ``It's important to me that
I go to bed every night happy with who I am and with the choices
I've made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of people's lives go off track in this
business,'' she adds. ``I've seen them really lose sight of
themselves, and I don't ever want to do that. All the time I ask my
friends, `I haven't changed, have I? I'm still the same person,
right?'''
</P>
<P>
   If she weren't, it would be understandable, given Gellar's
skyrocketing popularity as the stake-wielding, butt-kicking Buffy.
And there have been some well-reported episodes: A few months ago,
for example, the actress was being photographed for the cover of a
major entertainment magazine when she abruptly halted the
proceedings and packed up her belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it sexier and sexier, and I just couldn't do it,''
Gellar says, still bothered by the incident. ``I said, `You know
what, guys? What you want is not for me.' And I left the shoot. I
just walked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do what's sexy only to the degree I feel comfortable,'' she
says. ``I have a problem with so many actors these days going nude
for magazines. I thought we were promoting our talent, not our
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   She is quick to point out that ``Cruel Intentions,'' a
prep-school version of the classic ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' was
``very sexy and my character did a lot of risque things, including
kiss another woman, but she never actually had sex and I never
showed a thing. The only thing naked in the movie was Ryan
Phillippe's butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'd never appear nude in a film if I thought it
was important,'' the actress adds, ``but that script has yet to
come along.''
</P>
<P>
   A working actress since age 4, Gellar spent her teen years
playing in the suds, first in the syndicated serial ``Swan's
Crossing,'' which featured fellow rising star Mira Sorvino, and
then on ABC's ``All My Children,'' where she won an Emmy as
backstabbing brat Kendall Hart.
</P>
<P>
   It was on ``All My Children'' that the precocious Gellar played
her first love scene _ she was 15, while her partner, Michael
Nader, was pushing 50.
</P>
<P>
   It was also there that she realized that she had bigger dreams
than most of her co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone told me not to leave `AMC,''' Gellar recalls, ``and I
mean everybody. They petrified me! They reminded me of every soap
star who left daytime and couldn't get arrested. They said, `You'll
never work. You'll come crawling back.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, for a while, it looked like they were right. After quitting
the New York-based soap, Gellar headed west and found herself
barely able to land an audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Emmy was meaningless,'' she recalls with a laugh. ``I could
not get in the door for any project, much less the good ones. I
mean, I figured I'd at least get a little episodic work, maybe a
small role in a movie, maybe a lousy pilot _ but I got nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   A half-year later, things changed virtually overnight. The young
actress was cast in the television movie ``Beverly Hills Family
Robinson'' (1997), a modern-day shipwreck comedy starring Martin
Mull and Dyan Cannon. While filming that in Australia, she was
paged to audition for ``Buffy'' _ ironically, not for the title
character, but for the rich, snobby Cordelia.
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another, however, and Gellar hasn't looked back
since.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she remains one of the least-known stars in
Hollywood, in large part because of her fierce efforts to keep her
private life to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, Gellar was raised primarily by her mother, a
schoolteacher. The actress is estranged from her salesman father,
and has very little to say about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a person who exists in my life,'' she says. ``Just
because you donate sperm does not make you a father. I don't have a
father _ I would never give him the credit to acknowledge him as my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellar is equally tight-lipped about her love life. Though she
has been seen with actors Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Perry and
Jerry O'Connell at premieres and award shows, as well as with
``Buffy'' creator Joss Whedon and her former leading man David
Boreanaz, now the star of ``Angel,'' Gellar steadfastly insists
that anyone the paparazzi have caught her with is ``just a good
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are, you will not see me at one of those industry
events with someone I am interested in,'' she says, ``which is why
I go with Freddie or Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellar has never publicly confirmed being in a romantic
relationship during her recent years in the spotlight, but she says
she has indeed had them and has suffered her share of emotional
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I go out of my way to keep that private,'' she says. ``I
don't want to pick up some supermarket tabloid and find people
making judgments about me or read reports about how my guy is
cheating. It would put doubt in my mind. I'd be miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   She does confess that, these days, she's flying solo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no fun not having someone to snuggle up with on a rainy
day,'' she admits. ``I'd love to have the perfect boyfriend right
now _ but, as a society, we have to learn that it's OK not to be in
a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her show-biz peers are less discreet: Keri Russell of
``Felicity'' told Jane magazine how she lost her virginity in a
closet. Jessica Biel of ``Seventh Heaven'' tried to get herself
fired by posing nude in Gear.
</P>
<P>
   But Gellar is unswayable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My true fans appreciate and respect that I won't discuss
certain things,'' she says emphatically. ``The ones who have a
problem with it, the ones who want to dig into my life and make me
uncomfortable, are not my true fans.''
</P>

COMIC MINISTRATIONS: EDWARD NORTON IS `KEEPING THE FAITH' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Edward Norton with Ben Stiller in a
scene from ``Keeping the Faith.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Edward Norton freely admits that he identifies with the bad guy.
 &HT;    ``Good guys are just not where it's at for me,'' he says. ``I
marvel at the characters played by actors like De Niro and Pacino.
They played men so bad that they didn't just remain on the screen _
they were burned into your subconscious.''
 &HT;    Norton has played a few equally searing roles, including the
schizophrenic altar boy who murders the archbishop of Chicago in
``Primal Fear'' (1996) and his Oscar-nominated role as a
shaven-headed, swastika-tattooed white supremacist in ``American
History X'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``Don't forget that I beat Brad Pitt into pulp in `Fight
Club,''' Norton adds with a laugh. ``Quite a few people are still
harboring a few resentments for that one, although I just saw Brad
and he's fine.''
 &HT;    His current role won't add to that list, however. In ``Keeping
the Faith,'' opening nationwide on April 14, he plays a Catholic
priest without any discernible antisocial tendencies whatever.
 &HT;    ``I guess there comes a time when everyone needs to stretch a
little bit,'' Norton says with a laugh, draped over a chair at New
York's Regency Hotel.
 &HT;    That's for sure. ``Keeping the Faith'' _ which he describes as
``a $30 million priest-and-rabbi joke'' _ also marks Norton's
debuts as a director and as a producer.
 &HT;    He plays Father Brian Finn, best buddies since childhood with
Orthodox Rabbi Jacob Schram (Ben Stiller). A unique romantic
triangle forms when Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman), the woman both men
were fascinated with as teen-agers, reappears in their lives.
 &HT;    ``Of course, the priest cannot act on these feeling because of
his vows of celibacy,'' Norton says. ``The rabbi can't form a
relationship with her because she's not Jewish.''
 &HT;    Norton may describe the film as ``a romantic comedy in the
`Philadelphia Story' tradition,'' but he also sees a deeper
message.
 &HT;    ``It's a story about maintaining your traditions,'' he says
thoughtfully. ``To me it's also a movie about the stress people my
age feel, when they've been brought up by parents who exert this
religious pressure on their grown children.''
 &HT;    Sooner or later, Norton says, he was bound to move into
directing and producing.
 &HT;    ``I wanted the freedom to make the big choices,'' he says. ``The
worst thing about acting is the lack of authority over the final
product.
 &HT;    ``I also liked the idea of creating a project from start to
finish,'' he adds. ``Another tough part of being an actor is that
you sit around waiting for other people to say `yes' or `no' to
you. You get to this point where you long to be the catalyst.''
 &HT;    Thus, four years ago Norton teamed with screenwriter Stuart
Blumberg, an old college buddy from Yale with whom he also had
roomed during his early acting days in New York. Blumberg banged
out the script, but it took years before a studio _ Disney's
Touchstone Pictures _ finally gambled on the potentially
controversial story.
 &HT;    ``It was a scary process,'' Norton says, ``because the movie
literally consumes every waking moment of your life. There was also
an immense satisfaction when it was finished.''
 &HT;    His passion for the film has caused the normally press-shy
Norton to give more than his usual number of interviews, which he
freely admits isn't his idea of a good time.
 &HT;    ``The media has a way of reducing a complex human life and
boiling it into convenient copy,'' he says. ``I am the most private
person I know. I demand personal space, but I am an actor _ I work
for an audience. I do this for the people, and the people want to
know about me. That is the conflict.''
 &HT;    His last film, ``Fight Club'' (1999), was a box-office dud,
despite the presence of co-star Brad Pitt. But Norton doesn't see
any omen there for ``Keeping the Faith.''
 &HT;    ``You can't predict the box office,'' he says. ``You can't
predict what the public is in the mood to see on a Friday night.
But that's part of the risk of acting. It's all a big gamble _ in
fact, acting is the only thing in my life where I said, `I'm going
to let an enormous amount ride and just let fate decide what
happens.'''
 &HT;    Norton shrugs.
 &HT;    ``Any decision to pursue a creative life is a risk,'' he says.
``Any decision to pursue anything you care about is also
frightening, because you're so vulnerable. But there is no way to
go after something you care about without being scared. With my
fear is also an excitement.''
 &HT;    Born in 1969, Norton grew up in Columbia, Md., son of a lawyer
and a teacher. He began acting at age 5, and attended a school for
the theatrical arts in Baltimore. At 8, he recalls, he was known to
ask his teachers, ``What is my objective in this scene?''
 &HT;    Even then a serious young man, his biggest problem growing up
was his name, with its resonances of ``The Honeymooners.''
 &HT;    ``Actually, my father had it worse,'' Norton says. ``He would
get, `Hey, I love ``The Honeymooners!''' I would occasionally get
someone who would hear my name and scream, `To the moon, Alice!'''
 &HT;    After graduating from Yale, Norton spent a year in Japan and
then returned home. Settling in New York, he toyed with the idea of
going to law school, but supported himself as a proofreader while
trying to secure acting gigs. In 1994 he was cast in ``Fragments''
at New York's Signature Theatre Company.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't
gotten serious about acting,'' he says. ``I don't know what else I
could do. I guess I would have been just another one of those guys
getting through life, trying to be financially stable. But my heart
wasn't in that sort of life.''
 &HT;    He had minor roles in ``With Honors'' (1994) and ``Hackers''
(1995), and then got the chance to audition for the role of the
baby-faced psycho in ``Primal Fear'' after Leonardo DiCaprio
dropped out.
 &HT;    Knowing that the character was an Appalachian farm boy, and
taking advantage of his longtime facility with accents, Norton told
the casting agent that he came from eastern Kentucky and had grown
up poor. It was an out-and-out lie, but it worked _ he got the
part, and an Oscar nomination to go with it.
 &HT;    That critically acclaimed performance led to roles as a singing
preppie in Woody Allen's musical ``Everyone Says I Love You''
(1996) and as the lawyer for the publisher of Hustler magazine in
Milos Forman's ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' (1996).
 &HT;    As his star began to rise, however, Norton became a bit of a
hermit. He is extremely private about his personal life, and won't
discuss new girlfriend Salma Hayek or previous girlfriends Courtney
Love and Drew Barrymore.
 &HT;    ``I guess I need to lighten up about these matters of my private
life and take the interest in it as part of the silliness that goes
on,'' Norton says.
 &HT;    He shifts uncomfortably in his chair.
 &HT;    ``I find fame really bizarre,'' he says. ``Once in an interview,
someone asked me, `What is your blood type?' Does the public really
need to know all these details about an actor?''
 &HT;    No, he insists.
 &HT;    ``If the public knows too much about me,'' the actor says,
``they can't lose themselves in my characters. If I can't take
people on a journey away from who Edward Norton is, then what is
the point?''

`PSYCHO'-SOMATIC: CHRISTIAN BALE'S AMERICAN NIGHTMARE

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Christian Bale in a scene from
``American Psycho.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    A solitary figure, clad in jeans and wearing a pair of running
shoes, sits in the deserted garden of a less-then-trendy hotel in a
beach community near Los Angeles.
 &HT;    The handsome profile is what gives Christian Bale away.
Otherwise you wouldn't recognize him as Patrick Bateman, the
perfectly coiffed and manicured yuppie with a fondness for
expensive suits and serial killing whom he plays in ``American
Psycho.'' It's a startling counterpoint to his recent television
appearance as Jesus in ``Mary, Mother of Jesus.''
 &HT;    Offering a quiet greeting in a British-tinged accent, Bale is
pleasant enough but a bit shy, even wary. He'd rather talk about
his controversial role as a homicidal Wall Street executive than
discuss his life offscreen, especially his recent marriage.
 &HT;    ``It's not beneficial for an actor to talk about his personal
life,'' he says with a shrug. ``It becomes a lot more difficult to
make the audience believe in the character you're creating if they
know all about you.''
 &HT;    Bale is nothing if not believable as he immerses himself in
``American Psycho's'' wave of bloody killings and brutal sex.
Directed by Mary Harron and co-starring Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny
and Willem Dafoe, the dark drama _ which will open nationwide on
April 14 _ is based on Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel, and
seems likely to kick up just as much fuss.
 &HT;    ``I expect people will have a knee-jerk reaction to Bateman
because he's so repulsive,'' Bale admits, ``but I found him sort of
fascinatingly entertaining.
 &HT;    ``I had this complete misconception about `American Psycho,'
before I read the script, as this deep, dark analysis of a serial
killer,'' the actor says. ``It's actually a biting, satirical look
at young, rich men on Wall Street at their worst. I didn't do any
research into serial killing, because the mayhem Bateman creates is
so over-the-top it's not realistic. It's very black humor.
 &HT;    ``Bateman is a total exaggeration of the emotional bankruptcy of
yuppie men in the '80s,'' he concludes. ``They were like media
stars behaving badly, driven by this `Masters of the Universe'
attitude.
 &HT;    ``Bateman couldn't really exist, and that's how I played him.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Bale made a concerted effort to capture the look
of the narcissistic Bateman, who admires his own physical
appearance as much as the carnage he creates.
 &HT;    ``I did manic amounts of training,'' the actor says. ``I was as
obsessive as he was, running six miles a day, boxing and lifting
weights. I gave it up at the end of film, although I still run a
bit.
 &HT;    ``Then there was the diet,'' he adds with a sigh. ``It was so
boring. Pretty much all I ate the whole time we were filming was
grilled chicken, cottage cheese, egg whites and a lot of water.''
 &HT;    Mastering Bateman's well-heeled American accent was another
challenge.
 &HT;    ``I worked with a dialect coach for about four weeks,'' Bale
says, ``and I got it. I started sounding like an arrogant prick.
After that, I talked like Bateman 24 hours a day, whether I was on
or off the set.''
 &HT;    He spent less time preparing for the film's scenes of bloody
brutality, which range from an axe murder and stabbings to a
sadomasochistic orgy.
 &HT;    ``You can't get carried away with the violence,'' he says,
``otherwise I would have been doing things like really putting an
axe through Jared Leto's head. What helped me was that, even when I
was losing control as Bateman, I had to be in control to stay in
the right position for the camera and lighting.
 &HT;    ``The abundance of fake blood helped,'' he says with a wry
smile. ``There were times when you felt like you were jumping in a
fountain of it with all your clothes on. It's very liberating and
almost bestial _ I felt very primal and sort of in touch with
Bateman's insanity.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, he adds, ``It's not much fun sitting around
in fake blood for like six hours. It stains incredibly, and it sort
of works its way into your skin.''
 &HT;    As for the film's already-notorious orgy scene, which got it in
trouble with the ratings board, Bale reports that the orgy wasn't
very sexy at the time.
 &HT;    ``It's actually a very unerotic scene,'' he says, ``incredibly
cold and narcissistic, as if Bateman is playing out his fantasies
of being a porn star. I actually think it's more uncomfortable for
the director and the crew, having to focus on your naked butt while
you're doing all that stuff.''
 &HT;    It took a while for Bale to even get to that scene. After Harron
had prevailed on Lions Gate Films to cast Bale instead of an
American star, the studio suddenly fired her and offered the role
to Leonardo DiCaprio, at a reported $20 million. After wavering,
DiCaprio declined, and Harron and Bale returned to the project.
 &HT;    ``I think I was a little tough to be around while all that was
happening,'' Bale says. ``I waited around for a year and a half. If
I had known it was going to be that long, I would have taken other
work.''
 &HT;    And he didn't end up with DiCaprio's $20 million, either.
 &HT;    ``After all that,'' Bale says, ``I got paid less than the makeup
woman for doing the movie. It had a low budget and I got scale,
which is the minimum. The fact is that I went into debt _ thank
God, my agents paid my mortgage for me. If I did too many `American
Psychos,' I'd be living out of my car.''
 &HT;    Bale is collecting a bigger paycheck for his next film, John
Singleton's remake of ``Shaft,'' in which he plays the villain to
Samuel L. Jackson's cool detective. It's an unusually commercial
outing for the art-film-oriented Bale, but he retains his
longstanding skepticism toward the entire Hollywood machine.
 &HT;    ``My first major movie was `Empire of the Sun' (1987), when I
was 13,'' he says. ``I rather enjoyed all the attention I was
getting _ and then suddenly it seemed very wrong and I just wanted
to disappear from the scene. For a while, I thought I might give up
acting.''
 &HT;    He gazes across the garden, remembering his arrival in Hollywood
with a slight smile.
 &HT;    ``I was 17,'' he recalls, ``and suddenly, oh wow, all these
people were taking me out to clubs and bars and things. Famous
faces were everywhere, and I found it fascinating but also a bit
hilarious.
 &HT;    ``I never really lost myself in it,'' Bale says, ``although I'd
be the first to say I've been as much of a brat as anybody. But I
could see that I could suffer from the supreme overconfidence of
stardom like anybody else. It can kill your joy in the craft of
acting. When you get too serious about being seen at the right
places, it's not fun anymore.''
 &HT;    Sounds a little bit like Patrick Bateman's world.
 &HT;    Bale stares across the garden again, toward the pool where the
sunlight is creating a glittering pattern of stars on the water.
 &HT;    ``I guess there are correlations,'' he says finally. ``Extreme
vanity and megalomania, self-obsession, incredibly fierce
competition. That's what you have to be careful of.''

BOTTLED UP: BETTY THOMAS DIRECTS `28 DAYS' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Betty Thomas directing Sandra Bullock in
a scene from ``28 Days.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Betty Thomas didn't grow up thinking, ``Oh, if only I could be
an actress'' or ``I'm just dying to direct.''
 &HT;    In fact, she says during an interview at the Four Seasons hotel
in Los Angeles, it wasn't until she landed a job as a waitress at
Chicago's famous Second City comedy club that the idea crossed her
mind.
 &HT;    ``I went to a workshop,'' she recalls. ``Somebody got sick and
they said, `Well, Betty knows ... ' It was always me saying, `I'm
just standing in for ... ' Then I realized, `This is my entire
life. Am I just standing in for my life? What am I doing?'
 &HT;    ``So I grew to like acting,'' Thomas says. ``But because I was
an artist and a painter, I thought I'd make art films _ that was my
five-year plan.
 &HT;    ``It didn't work out that way.''
 &HT;    Indeed it didn't. Performing comedy with Second City led to a
role as Officer Lucy Bates on the landmark television drama ``Hill
Street Blues.'' Eventually she made the leap to directing, first
with episodes of such series as ``Dream On'' and then with the hit
feature, ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' (1995). Her subsequent directing
credits include ``The Late Shift'' (1996), the Howard Stern
biography ``Private Parts'' (1997) and ``Doctor Dolittle'' (1998).
 &HT;    ```Hill Street' and all the acting I did with Second City, I
feel, was just preparation for being a director,'' Thomas says.
``If you're supposed to do something, you wind up doing it, I
guess.''
 &HT;    The director's latest film is ``28 Days,'' a drama with large
dollops of humor. Sandra Bullock stars as Gwen Cummings, a New York
writer who lives hard and drinks harder. After ruining the wedding
of her sister (Elizabeth Perkins) by crashing a limo into a house,
Gwen is sentenced to 28 days in a rehab facility.
 &HT;    The action centers on Gwen's effort to reclaim her life and on
her interaction with a group of fellow screw-ups (Viggo Mortensen,
Azura Skye, Alan Tudyk, Michael O'Malley and Marianne
Jean-Baptiste).
 &HT;    While prepping the film, Thomas spent several days at a
real-life rehab facility. She heard every conceivable story and
soaked up the methods of therapy, which ranged from the touching of
horses to the wearing of message-bearing signs.
 &HT;    She also heard a variety of sappy exit songs and listened to sex
addicts tell of doing it in the elevator.
 &HT;    ``It's all true, it's all true,'' says the high-energy Thomas,
who's decked out head to toe in black, with two pairs of glasses
dangling from strings around her neck. ``Interesting, isn't it? The
horse thing? True. I went to rehab, came back and said, `We're
putting this in the movie!'''
 &HT;    And, no, it doesn't bother her if, in this fairly substantial
drama, ``the horse thing'' and other offbeat elements nonetheless
draw some big laughs.
 &HT;    ``I want the audience to laugh,'' Thomas insists. ``I want them
to think about the laugh or not think about the laugh. Whatever
their reaction is, I think it's the right thing.
 &HT;    ``I went to rehab,'' she adds, ``and my experience was that
people were laughing and making jokes because they have to. You
have to _ just like cops make jokes, rehab people make jokes and
A.A. people make jokes. They make jokes about the horribleness, the
hardships and the melodrama of their own lives.
 &HT;    ``When I saw that, I knew we had to strive for more comedy in
the film.''
 &HT;    The film is Thomas' most serious effort to date, but it's also a
challenge for Bullock, who is best known for lighter fare.
 &HT;    ``Who knew?'' Thomas says. ``Who knew Sandy could be so complex
and fabulous? I only hoped.
 &HT;    ``I wanted her because she's the girl next door, she's the
accessible star,'' the director says. ``It's amazing to walk around
with her, because people come up to her and go, `Oh, hi, Sandy, how
are you?' It's like they're friends for 50 years.
 &HT;    ``I'm like, `Dude, this is a major star,''' she says. ``But she
approaches people like that, too, which is the right attitude for
the movie.''
 &HT;    Bullock, on the other hand, has said that she chose ``28 Days''
in part to shed that girl-next-door image _ which isn't the
contradiction it seems, Thomas believes.
 &HT;    ``I wanted that image of her,'' she says. ``I didn't want that
in the movie, and that's not what I got. I hired who she was,
because that's the image _ not the person _ in this movie.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, she isn't that,'' Thomas adds. ``I chose that as
the thing I wanted, to allow the audience to get into it, and then
I hoped I got _ and I got it _ this complex human being with plenty
of places to go.
 &HT;    ``I assume Sandy took the movie because she knew she could go
those places, that she said, `I haven't had a chance to go these
places and now I get to go.'''
 &HT;    For her own part, Thomas welcomed the opportunity to work with
darker, more emotionally powerful subject matter than she had
previously. It let her employ a wider range of directorial
techniques, including, in one crucial scene between Bullock and
Perkins, a single-take sequence that runs for one minute and 45
seconds _ an eternity by Hollywood standards.
 &HT;    ``I was so afraid,'' Thomas says. ``I'd never even approached a
scene like that before. I was like, `Aaaaah! Somebody's gonna
notice!' But you are so into Sandy and her face and the way she's
falling apart.
 &HT;    ``There was no other way to do it,'' she says. ``If I'd done
anything else, it would have been schmutzy and horrible _ as soon
as you cut, you ruin everything.''
 &HT;    The more she works, Thomas says, and the more she makes
different types of movies, the more comfortable she feels behind
the camera.
 &HT;    ``Well, I'm just learning s--t and getting better,'' she says.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm getting better. Hopefully, I have some kind of
depth.
 &HT;    ``Love and laugh,'' she says cheerfully. ``I agree with Preston
Sturges. A laugh is an important thing _ all of us in a room
together, laughing, that's important for humanity.
 &HT;    ``If that's all I do, that's fine. That'll be good.''
 &HT;    Next up for Thomas is ``The Dreyfus Affair,'' a comedy/drama
about two pro baseball players who come out of the closet. Ben
Affleck was supposed to star, but scheduling conflicts now have
left that in question.
 &HT;    When she isn't behind the camera, Thomas moonlights as a
producer. She and her partner, Jenno Topping, formed the production
company Tall Trees two years ago, and since then have produced
``Can't Hardly Wait'' (1998) and ``28 Days.'' They're currently
filming the big-screen version of the 1970s jiggle-television
classic ``Charlie's Angels.''
 &HT;    About the only thing she isn't doing these days, in fact, is
acting.
 &HT;    ``I'm done until I retire from directing,'' the 52-year-old
Thomas says. ``And then I'll be the next-door neighbor on a sitcom,
where I don't have to show my face.
 &HT;    ``That way I don't have to have any work done or anything stupid
like that.''

 (Includes a color slide of Sarah Michelle Gellar in a scene from
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'') 
 By MICHAEL LOGAN  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not for release in Canada until 16 April. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah Michelle Gellar is the queen of contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   The star of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' who will turn 23 on
April 14, is one of Hollywood's most opinionated and outspoken
actresses _ yet also one of its most private.
</P>
<P>
   She is supremely focused and clearheaded _ yet speaks at warp
speed, rarely concluding one topic before hurling herself headlong
into the next.
</P>
<P>
   She is sweet yet sassy, insecure yet audaciously self-confident,
childlike yet wise beyond her years.
</P>
<P>
   A role model for millions of young people, Gellar is avidly
antidrug and almost puritanical in her morals, yet she's been known
to toss her convictions aside for movie roles _ she played a
coke-snorting villainess in ``Cruel Intentions'' (1999) _ and the
occasional fashion spread, such as the Rolling Stone cover for
which she posed in kinky red leather and brandished a whip.
</P>
<P>
   Gellar is, quite simply, one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a decision _ a rule, really _ when I was very young
that I would always stay true to myself,'' Gellar says over lunch
in her trailer near the ``Buffy'' set. ``It's important to me that
I go to bed every night happy with who I am and with the choices
I've made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of people's lives go off track in this
business,'' she adds. ``I've seen them really lose sight of
themselves, and I don't ever want to do that. All the time I ask my
friends, `I haven't changed, have I? I'm still the same person,
right?'''
</P>
<P>
   If she weren't, it would be understandable, given Gellar's
skyrocketing popularity as the stake-wielding, butt-kicking Buffy.
And there have been some well-reported episodes: A few months ago,
for example, the actress was being photographed for the cover of a
major entertainment magazine when she abruptly halted the
proceedings and packed up her belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it sexier and sexier, and I just couldn't do it,''
Gellar says, still bothered by the incident. ``I said, `You know
what, guys? What you want is not for me.' And I left the shoot. I
just walked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do what's sexy only to the degree I feel comfortable,'' she
says. ``I have a problem with so many actors these days going nude
for magazines. I thought we were promoting our talent, not our
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   She is quick to point out that ``Cruel Intentions,'' a
prep-school version of the classic ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' was
``very sexy and my character did a lot of risque things, including
kiss another woman, but she never actually had sex and I never
showed a thing. The only thing naked in the movie was Ryan
Phillippe's butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'd never appear nude in a film if I thought it
was important,'' the actress adds, ``but that script has yet to
come along.''
</P>
<P>
   A working actress since age 4, Gellar spent her teen years
playing in the suds, first in the syndicated serial ``Swan's
Crossing,'' which featured fellow rising star Mira Sorvino, and
then on ABC's ``All My Children,'' where she won an Emmy as
backstabbing brat Kendall Hart.
</P>
<P>
   It was on ``All My Children'' that the precocious Gellar played
her first love scene _ she was 15, while her partner, Michael
Nader, was pushing 50.
</P>
<P>
   It was also there that she realized that she had bigger dreams
than most of her co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone told me not to leave `AMC,''' Gellar recalls, ``and I
mean everybody. They petrified me! They reminded me of every soap
star who left daytime and couldn't get arrested. They said, `You'll
never work. You'll come crawling back.'''
</P>
<P>
   And, for a while, it looked like they were right. After quitting
the New York-based soap, Gellar headed west and found herself
barely able to land an audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Emmy was meaningless,'' she recalls with a laugh. ``I could
not get in the door for any project, much less the good ones. I
mean, I figured I'd at least get a little episodic work, maybe a
small role in a movie, maybe a lousy pilot _ but I got nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   A half-year later, things changed virtually overnight. The young
actress was cast in the television movie ``Beverly Hills Family
Robinson'' (1997), a modern-day shipwreck comedy starring Martin
Mull and Dyan Cannon. While filming that in Australia, she was
paged to audition for ``Buffy'' _ ironically, not for the title
character, but for the rich, snobby Cordelia.
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another, however, and Gellar hasn't looked back
since.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she remains one of the least-known stars in
Hollywood, in large part because of her fierce efforts to keep her
private life to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, Gellar was raised primarily by her mother, a
schoolteacher. The actress is estranged from her salesman father,
and has very little to say about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a person who exists in my life,'' she says. ``Just
because you donate sperm does not make you a father. I don't have a
father _ I would never give him the credit to acknowledge him as my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellar is equally tight-lipped about her love life. Though she
has been seen with actors Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Perry and
Jerry O'Connell at premieres and award shows, as well as with
``Buffy'' creator Joss Whedon and her former leading man David
Boreanaz, now the star of ``Angel,'' Gellar steadfastly insists
that anyone the paparazzi have caught her with is ``just a good
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are, you will not see me at one of those industry
events with someone I am interested in,'' she says, ``which is why
I go with Freddie or Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gellar has never publicly confirmed being in a romantic
relationship during her recent years in the spotlight, but she says
she has indeed had them and has suffered her share of emotional
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I go out of my way to keep that private,'' she says. ``I
don't want to pick up some supermarket tabloid and find people
making judgments about me or read reports about how my guy is
cheating. It would put doubt in my mind. I'd be miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   She does confess that, these days, she's flying solo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no fun not having someone to snuggle up with on a rainy
day,'' she admits. ``I'd love to have the perfect boyfriend right
now _ but, as a society, we have to learn that it's OK not to be in
a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of her show-biz peers are less discreet: Keri Russell of
``Felicity'' told Jane magazine how she lost her virginity in a
closet. Jessica Biel of ``Seventh Heaven'' tried to get herself
fired by posing nude in Gear.
</P>
<P>
   But Gellar is unswayable.
</P>
<P>
   ``My true fans appreciate and respect that I won't discuss
certain things,'' she says emphatically. ``The ones who have a
problem with it, the ones who want to dig into my life and make me
uncomfortable, are not my true fans.''

COMIC MINISTRATIONS: EDWARD NORTON IS `KEEPING THE FAITH' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Edward Norton with Ben Stiller in a
scene from ``Keeping the Faith.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Edward Norton freely admits that he identifies with the bad guy.
 &HT;    ``Good guys are just not where it's at for me,'' he says. ``I
marvel at the characters played by actors like De Niro and Pacino.
They played men so bad that they didn't just remain on the screen _
they were burned into your subconscious.''
 &HT;    Norton has played a few equally searing roles, including the
schizophrenic altar boy who murders the archbishop of Chicago in
``Primal Fear'' (1996) and his Oscar-nominated role as a
shaven-headed, swastika-tattooed white supremacist in ``American
History X'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``Don't forget that I beat Brad Pitt into pulp in `Fight
Club,''' Norton adds with a laugh. ``Quite a few people are still
harboring a few resentments for that one, although I just saw Brad
and he's fine.''
 &HT;    His current role won't add to that list, however. In ``Keeping
the Faith,'' opening nationwide on April 14, he plays a Catholic
priest without any discernible antisocial tendencies whatever.
 &HT;    ``I guess there comes a time when everyone needs to stretch a
little bit,'' Norton says with a laugh, draped over a chair at New
York's Regency Hotel.
 &HT;    That's for sure. ``Keeping the Faith'' _ which he describes as
``a $30 million priest-and-rabbi joke'' _ also marks Norton's
debuts as a director and as a producer.
 &HT;    He plays Father Brian Finn, best buddies since childhood with
Orthodox Rabbi Jacob Schram (Ben Stiller). A unique romantic
triangle forms when Anna Reilly (Jenna Elfman), the woman both men
were fascinated with as teen-agers, reappears in their lives.
 &HT;    ``Of course, the priest cannot act on these feeling because of
his vows of celibacy,'' Norton says. ``The rabbi can't form a
relationship with her because she's not Jewish.''
 &HT;    Norton may describe the film as ``a romantic comedy in the
`Philadelphia Story' tradition,'' but he also sees a deeper
message.
 &HT;    ``It's a story about maintaining your traditions,'' he says
thoughtfully. ``To me it's also a movie about the stress people my
age feel, when they've been brought up by parents who exert this
religious pressure on their grown children.''
 &HT;    Sooner or later, Norton says, he was bound to move into
directing and producing.
 &HT;    ``I wanted the freedom to make the big choices,'' he says. ``The
worst thing about acting is the lack of authority over the final
product.
 &HT;    ``I also liked the idea of creating a project from start to
finish,'' he adds. ``Another tough part of being an actor is that
you sit around waiting for other people to say `yes' or `no' to
you. You get to this point where you long to be the catalyst.''
 &HT;    Thus, four years ago Norton teamed with screenwriter Stuart
Blumberg, an old college buddy from Yale with whom he also had
roomed during his early acting days in New York. Blumberg banged
out the script, but it took years before a studio _ Disney's
Touchstone Pictures _ finally gambled on the potentially
controversial story.
 &HT;    ``It was a scary process,'' Norton says, ``because the movie
literally consumes every waking moment of your life. There was also
an immense satisfaction when it was finished.''
 &HT;    His passion for the film has caused the normally press-shy
Norton to give more than his usual number of interviews, which he
freely admits isn't his idea of a good time.
 &HT;    ``The media has a way of reducing a complex human life and
boiling it into convenient copy,'' he says. ``I am the most private
person I know. I demand personal space, but I am an actor _ I work
for an audience. I do this for the people, and the people want to
know about me. That is the conflict.''
 &HT;    His last film, ``Fight Club'' (1999), was a box-office dud,
despite the presence of co-star Brad Pitt. But Norton doesn't see
any omen there for ``Keeping the Faith.''
 &HT;    ``You can't predict the box office,'' he says. ``You can't
predict what the public is in the mood to see on a Friday night.
But that's part of the risk of acting. It's all a big gamble _ in
fact, acting is the only thing in my life where I said, `I'm going
to let an enormous amount ride and just let fate decide what
happens.'''
 &HT;    Norton shrugs.
 &HT;    ``Any decision to pursue a creative life is a risk,'' he says.
``Any decision to pursue anything you care about is also
frightening, because you're so vulnerable. But there is no way to
go after something you care about without being scared. With my
fear is also an excitement.''
 &HT;    Born in 1969, Norton grew up in Columbia, Md., son of a lawyer
and a teacher. He began acting at age 5, and attended a school for
the theatrical arts in Baltimore. At 8, he recalls, he was known to
ask his teachers, ``What is my objective in this scene?''
 &HT;    Even then a serious young man, his biggest problem growing up
was his name, with its resonances of ``The Honeymooners.''
 &HT;    ``Actually, my father had it worse,'' Norton says. ``He would
get, `Hey, I love ``The Honeymooners!''' I would occasionally get
someone who would hear my name and scream, `To the moon, Alice!'''
 &HT;    After graduating from Yale, Norton spent a year in Japan and
then returned home. Settling in New York, he toyed with the idea of
going to law school, but supported himself as a proofreader while
trying to secure acting gigs. In 1994 he was cast in ``Fragments''
at New York's Signature Theatre Company.
 &HT;    ``Honestly, I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't
gotten serious about acting,'' he says. ``I don't know what else I
could do. I guess I would have been just another one of those guys
getting through life, trying to be financially stable. But my heart
wasn't in that sort of life.''
 &HT;    He had minor roles in ``With Honors'' (1994) and ``Hackers''
(1995), and then got the chance to audition for the role of the
baby-faced psycho in ``Primal Fear'' after Leonardo DiCaprio
dropped out.
 &HT;    Knowing that the character was an Appalachian farm boy, and
taking advantage of his longtime facility with accents, Norton told
the casting agent that he came from eastern Kentucky and had grown
up poor. It was an out-and-out lie, but it worked _ he got the
part, and an Oscar nomination to go with it.
 &HT;    That critically acclaimed performance led to roles as a singing
preppie in Woody Allen's musical ``Everyone Says I Love You''
(1996) and as the lawyer for the publisher of Hustler magazine in
Milos Forman's ``The People vs. Larry Flynt'' (1996).
 &HT;    As his star began to rise, however, Norton became a bit of a
hermit. He is extremely private about his personal life, and won't
discuss new girlfriend Salma Hayek or previous girlfriends Courtney
Love and Drew Barrymore.
 &HT;    ``I guess I need to lighten up about these matters of my private
life and take the interest in it as part of the silliness that goes
on,'' Norton says.
 &HT;    He shifts uncomfortably in his chair.
 &HT;    ``I find fame really bizarre,'' he says. ``Once in an interview,
someone asked me, `What is your blood type?' Does the public really
need to know all these details about an actor?''
 &HT;    No, he insists.
 &HT;    ``If the public knows too much about me,'' the actor says,
``they can't lose themselves in my characters. If I can't take
people on a journey away from who Edward Norton is, then what is
the point?''

`PSYCHO'-SOMATIC: CHRISTIAN BALE'S AMERICAN NIGHTMARE 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Christian Bale in a scene from
``American Psycho.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    A solitary figure, clad in jeans and wearing a pair of running
shoes, sits in the deserted garden of a less-then-trendy hotel in a
beach community near Los Angeles.
 &HT;    The handsome profile is what gives Christian Bale away.
Otherwise you wouldn't recognize him as Patrick Bateman, the
perfectly coiffed and manicured yuppie with a fondness for
expensive suits and serial killing whom he plays in ``American
Psycho.'' It's a startling counterpoint to his recent television
appearance as Jesus in ``Mary, Mother of Jesus.''
 &HT;    Offering a quiet greeting in a British-tinged accent, Bale is
pleasant enough but a bit shy, even wary. He'd rather talk about
his controversial role as a homicidal Wall Street executive than
discuss his life offscreen, especially his recent marriage.
 &HT;    ``It's not beneficial for an actor to talk about his personal
life,'' he says with a shrug. ``It becomes a lot more difficult to
make the audience believe in the character you're creating if they
know all about you.''
 &HT;    Bale is nothing if not believable as he immerses himself in
``American Psycho's'' wave of bloody killings and brutal sex.
Directed by Mary Harron and co-starring Jared Leto, Chloe Sevigny
and Willem Dafoe, the dark drama _ which will open nationwide on
April 14 _ is based on Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel, and
seems likely to kick up just as much fuss.
 &HT;    ``I expect people will have a knee-jerk reaction to Bateman
because he's so repulsive,'' Bale admits, ``but I found him sort of
fascinatingly entertaining.
 &HT;    ``I had this complete misconception about `American Psycho,'
before I read the script, as this deep, dark analysis of a serial
killer,'' the actor says. ``It's actually a biting, satirical look
at young, rich men on Wall Street at their worst. I didn't do any
research into serial killing, because the mayhem Bateman creates is
so over-the-top it's not realistic. It's very black humor.
 &HT;    ``Bateman is a total exaggeration of the emotional bankruptcy of
yuppie men in the '80s,'' he concludes. ``They were like media
stars behaving badly, driven by this `Masters of the Universe'
attitude.
 &HT;    ``Bateman couldn't really exist, and that's how I played him.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Bale made a concerted effort to capture the look
of the narcissistic Bateman, who admires his own physical
appearance as much as the carnage he creates.
 &HT;    ``I did manic amounts of training,'' the actor says. ``I was as
obsessive as he was, running six miles a day, boxing and lifting
weights. I gave it up at the end of film, although I still run a
bit.
 &HT;    ``Then there was the diet,'' he adds with a sigh. ``It was so
boring. Pretty much all I ate the whole time we were filming was
grilled chicken, cottage cheese, egg whites and a lot of water.''
 &HT;    Mastering Bateman's well-heeled American accent was another
challenge.
 &HT;    ``I worked with a dialect coach for about four weeks,'' Bale
says, ``and I got it. I started sounding like an arrogant prick.
After that, I talked like Bateman 24 hours a day, whether I was on
or off the set.''
 &HT;    He spent less time preparing for the film's scenes of bloody
brutality, which range from an axe murder and stabbings to a
sadomasochistic orgy.
 &HT;    ``You can't get carried away with the violence,'' he says,
``otherwise I would have been doing things like really putting an
axe through Jared Leto's head. What helped me was that, even when I
was losing control as Bateman, I had to be in control to stay in
the right position for the camera and lighting.
 &HT;    ``The abundance of fake blood helped,'' he says with a wry
smile. ``There were times when you felt like you were jumping in a
fountain of it with all your clothes on. It's very liberating and
almost bestial _ I felt very primal and sort of in touch with
Bateman's insanity.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, he adds, ``It's not much fun sitting around
in fake blood for like six hours. It stains incredibly, and it sort
of works its way into your skin.''
 &HT;    As for the film's already-notorious orgy scene, which got it in
trouble with the ratings board, Bale reports that the orgy wasn't
very sexy at the time.
 &HT;    ``It's actually a very unerotic scene,'' he says, ``incredibly
cold and narcissistic, as if Bateman is playing out his fantasies
of being a porn star. I actually think it's more uncomfortable for
the director and the crew, having to focus on your naked butt while
you're doing all that stuff.''
 &HT;    It took a while for Bale to even get to that scene. After Harron
had prevailed on Lions Gate Films to cast Bale instead of an
American star, the studio suddenly fired her and offered the role
to Leonardo DiCaprio, at a reported $20 million. After wavering,
DiCaprio declined, and Harron and Bale returned to the project.
 &HT;    ``I think I was a little tough to be around while all that was
happening,'' Bale says. ``I waited around for a year and a half. If
I had known it was going to be that long, I would have taken other
work.''
 &HT;    And he didn't end up with DiCaprio's $20 million, either.
 &HT;    ``After all that,'' Bale says, ``I got paid less than the makeup
woman for doing the movie. It had a low budget and I got scale,
which is the minimum. The fact is that I went into debt _ thank
God, my agents paid my mortgage for me. If I did too many `American
Psychos,' I'd be living out of my car.''
 &HT;    Bale is collecting a bigger paycheck for his next film, John
Singleton's remake of ``Shaft,'' in which he plays the villain to
Samuel L. Jackson's cool detective. It's an unusually commercial
outing for the art-film-oriented Bale, but he retains his
longstanding skepticism toward the entire Hollywood machine.
 &HT;    ``My first major movie was `Empire of the Sun' (1987), when I
was 13,'' he says. ``I rather enjoyed all the attention I was
getting _ and then suddenly it seemed very wrong and I just wanted
to disappear from the scene. For a while, I thought I might give up
acting.''
 &HT;    He gazes across the garden, remembering his arrival in Hollywood
with a slight smile.
 &HT;    ``I was 17,'' he recalls, ``and suddenly, oh wow, all these
people were taking me out to clubs and bars and things. Famous
faces were everywhere, and I found it fascinating but also a bit
hilarious.
 &HT;    ``I never really lost myself in it,'' Bale says, ``although I'd
be the first to say I've been as much of a brat as anybody. But I
could see that I could suffer from the supreme overconfidence of
stardom like anybody else. It can kill your joy in the craft of
acting. When you get too serious about being seen at the right
places, it's not fun anymore.''
 &HT;    Sounds a little bit like Patrick Bateman's world.
 &HT;    Bale stares across the garden again, toward the pool where the
sunlight is creating a glittering pattern of stars on the water.
 &HT;    ``I guess there are correlations,'' he says finally. ``Extreme
vanity and megalomania, self-obsession, incredibly fierce
competition. That's what you have to be careful of.''

BOTTLED UP: BETTY THOMAS DIRECTS `28 DAYS'

 (Includes a color slide of Betty Thomas directing Sandra Bullock in
a scene from ``28 Days.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Betty Thomas didn't grow up thinking, ``Oh, if only I could be
an actress'' or ``I'm just dying to direct.''
 &HT;    In fact, she says during an interview at the Four Seasons hotel
in Los Angeles, it wasn't until she landed a job as a waitress at
Chicago's famous Second City comedy club that the idea crossed her
mind.
 &HT;    ``I went to a workshop,'' she recalls. ``Somebody got sick and
they said, `Well, Betty knows ... ' It was always me saying, `I'm
just standing in for ... ' Then I realized, `This is my entire
life. Am I just standing in for my life? What am I doing?'
 &HT;    ``So I grew to like acting,'' Thomas says. ``But because I was
an artist and a painter, I thought I'd make art films _ that was my
five-year plan.
 &HT;    ``It didn't work out that way.''
 &HT;    Indeed it didn't. Performing comedy with Second City led to a
role as Officer Lucy Bates on the landmark television drama ``Hill
Street Blues.'' Eventually she made the leap to directing, first
with episodes of such series as ``Dream On'' and then with the hit
feature, ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' (1995). Her subsequent directing
credits include ``The Late Shift'' (1996), the Howard Stern
biography ``Private Parts'' (1997) and ``Doctor Dolittle'' (1998).
 &HT;    ```Hill Street' and all the acting I did with Second City, I
feel, was just preparation for being a director,'' Thomas says.
``If you're supposed to do something, you wind up doing it, I
guess.''
 &HT;    The director's latest film is ``28 Days,'' a drama with large
dollops of humor. Sandra Bullock stars as Gwen Cummings, a New York
writer who lives hard and drinks harder. After ruining the wedding
of her sister (Elizabeth Perkins) by crashing a limo into a house,
Gwen is sentenced to 28 days in a rehab facility.
 &HT;    The action centers on Gwen's effort to reclaim her life and on
her interaction with a group of fellow screw-ups (Viggo Mortensen,
Azura Skye, Alan Tudyk, Michael O'Malley and Marianne
Jean-Baptiste).
 &HT;    While prepping the film, Thomas spent several days at a
real-life rehab facility. She heard every conceivable story and
soaked up the methods of therapy, which ranged from the touching of
horses to the wearing of message-bearing signs.
 &HT;    She also heard a variety of sappy exit songs and listened to sex
addicts tell of doing it in the elevator.
 &HT;    ``It's all true, it's all true,'' says the high-energy Thomas,
who's decked out head to toe in black, with two pairs of glasses
dangling from strings around her neck. ``Interesting, isn't it? The
horse thing? True. I went to rehab, came back and said, `We're
putting this in the movie!'''
 &HT;    And, no, it doesn't bother her if, in this fairly substantial
drama, ``the horse thing'' and other offbeat elements nonetheless
draw some big laughs.
 &HT;    ``I want the audience to laugh,'' Thomas insists. ``I want them
to think about the laugh or not think about the laugh. Whatever
their reaction is, I think it's the right thing.
 &HT;    ``I went to rehab,'' she adds, ``and my experience was that
people were laughing and making jokes because they have to. You
have to _ just like cops make jokes, rehab people make jokes and
A.A. people make jokes. They make jokes about the horribleness, the
hardships and the melodrama of their own lives.
 &HT;    ``When I saw that, I knew we had to strive for more comedy in
the film.''
 &HT;    The film is Thomas' most serious effort to date, but it's also a
challenge for Bullock, who is best known for lighter fare.
 &HT;    ``Who knew?'' Thomas says. ``Who knew Sandy could be so complex
and fabulous? I only hoped.
 &HT;    ``I wanted her because she's the girl next door, she's the
accessible star,'' the director says. ``It's amazing to walk around
with her, because people come up to her and go, `Oh, hi, Sandy, how
are you?' It's like they're friends for 50 years.
 &HT;    ``I'm like, `Dude, this is a major star,''' she says. ``But she
approaches people like that, too, which is the right attitude for
the movie.''
 &HT;    Bullock, on the other hand, has said that she chose ``28 Days''
in part to shed that girl-next-door image _ which isn't the
contradiction it seems, Thomas believes.
 &HT;    ``I wanted that image of her,'' she says. ``I didn't want that
in the movie, and that's not what I got. I hired who she was,
because that's the image _ not the person _ in this movie.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, she isn't that,'' Thomas adds. ``I chose that as
the thing I wanted, to allow the audience to get into it, and then
I hoped I got _ and I got it _ this complex human being with plenty
of places to go.
 &HT;    ``I assume Sandy took the movie because she knew she could go
those places, that she said, `I haven't had a chance to go these
places and now I get to go.'''
 &HT;    For her own part, Thomas welcomed the opportunity to work with
darker, more emotionally powerful subject matter than she had
previously. It let her employ a wider range of directorial
techniques, including, in one crucial scene between Bullock and
Perkins, a single-take sequence that runs for one minute and 45
seconds _ an eternity by Hollywood standards.
 &HT;    ``I was so afraid,'' Thomas says. ``I'd never even approached a
scene like that before. I was like, `Aaaaah! Somebody's gonna
notice!' But you are so into Sandy and her face and the way she's
falling apart.
 &HT;    ``There was no other way to do it,'' she says. ``If I'd done
anything else, it would have been schmutzy and horrible _ as soon
as you cut, you ruin everything.''
 &HT;    The more she works, Thomas says, and the more she makes
different types of movies, the more comfortable she feels behind
the camera.
 &HT;    ``Well, I'm just learning s--t and getting better,'' she says.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm getting better. Hopefully, I have some kind of
depth.
 &HT;    ``Love and laugh,'' she says cheerfully. ``I agree with Preston
Sturges. A laugh is an important thing _ all of us in a room
together, laughing, that's important for humanity.
 &HT;    ``If that's all I do, that's fine. That'll be good.''
 &HT;    Next up for Thomas is ``The Dreyfus Affair,'' a comedy/drama
about two pro baseball players who come out of the closet. Ben
Affleck was supposed to star, but scheduling conflicts now have
left that in question.
 &HT;    When she isn't behind the camera, Thomas moonlights as a
producer. She and her partner, Jenno Topping, formed the production
company Tall Trees two years ago, and since then have produced
``Can't Hardly Wait'' (1998) and ``28 Days.'' They're currently
filming the big-screen version of the 1970s jiggle-television
classic ``Charlie's Angels.''
 &HT;    About the only thing she isn't doing these days, in fact, is
acting.
 &HT;    ``I'm done until I retire from directing,'' the 52-year-old
Thomas says. ``And then I'll be the next-door neighbor on a sitcom,
where I don't have to show my face.
 &HT;    ``That way I don't have to have any work done or anything stupid
like that.''

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Don't be surprised if Brazil receives undue
attention this month during the U.S. government's annual rating of
drug-fighting around the globe. Nowadays, Brazilian drug smugglers
have more logistics choices than Ford Motor Co.
 &HT;    With more and more jets and barges plying cross-border trade
routes, getting through the Amazon jungle is no longer a major
problem. Eighteen-wheelers haul the illicit cargo to the coast,
where high-tech container equipment and allegedly corrupt officials
help move the contraband to the United States, Europe and other
destinations, according to recent Brazilian congressional hearings
and international investigations.
 &HT;    What's making all this possible? Free trade, says a recent U.S.
Maritime Administration security report. Not only has increasing
commerce between South American countries led to improved transport
infrastructure, but the report warns ``the urgency to facilitate
trade and expedite the processing of cargo'' is resulting in the
relaxation of cargo scrutiny. For example, it cites the
Paraguay-Parana river system, which has become a popular route to
smuggle cocaine shipments from Bolivia into Paraguay, southeastern
Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina.
 &HT;    The numbers show an increasing problem. In just the first five
months of 1999, Brazilian authorities had captured more than half
of 1998's total of six metric tons of cocaine. Over the past 10
years, police have seized about 215 tons of drugs _ 116 in the past
four years alone.
 &HT;    The international law enforcement community has been issuing
warnings for years about Brazil's increasing role in the global
drug trade and organized crime network. But in recent years,
according to a recent U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
report, the improved river transportation system in northwestern
Brazil has encouraged narco-traffickers to move cocaine base
through Brazil from Andean cultivation areas to processing material
laboratories in Colombia. Meanwhile, in the south, drugs are moved
by air and over land from Bolivia and Peru to places with
international gateways such as Porto Alegre, Santos and Rio de
Janeiro.
 &HT;    Brazilian drug smugglers have about 200 jets at their disposal,
according to testimony given during recent congressional hearings.
They use large farms in the Amazon interior owned by rich ranchers
_ allegedly among them Hildebrando Pascoal, who was kicked out of
the Brazilian Congress after being accused of smuggling, murder and
related crimes.
 &HT;    The hearings have revealed drug smuggling problems throughout
the rest of the country as well, from the wild Amazon to the
postcard ports of Rio de Janeiro. ``There will always be drug
trafficking here,'' admits Eliane da Cunha Kullmann, head of public
communications for the Federal Police in Rio.
 &HT;    Despite increasing success in drug seizures, the anti-narcotics
operations barely scratch the surface. Police recently found a
laboratory in Para that was processing up to 10 tons of cocaine
each month. Federal police estimate there are six daily jet flights
of illegal drugs _ one plane they seized contained more than 800
kilos.
 &HT;    President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has admitted that corruption
could be found in the highest level of government _ as much, he
said, as can be found in Italy. Other investigators have discovered
that already to be the case: According to the International
Criminal Police Organization, more commonly known as Interpol,
Brazil ranks third _ after Italy and the United States _ among
countries favored by the loose-knit Italian organized crime group
known as the Cosa Nostra.
 &HT;    Italian and Brazilian police report that Italian drug
traffickers in Brazil command a large complex distribution and
export system for smuggling Colombian and Bolivian cocaine into
Europe. Indeed, almost all of the 120 people recently charged with
moving drugs through the Amazon town of Tabatinga were taking
Colombian cocaine to Europe. And of the 20 foreigners Brazil has
extradited for drug-smuggling offenses, 15 were from Italy.
 &HT;    According to the DEA's report, Brazil has made some progress in
its battle against drug smuggling. In late 1998, President Cardoso
created the National Anti-Drug Secretariat (Senad) to coordinate
all counter-narcotics programs and efforts. In February, the
Brazilian Congress passed anti-money-laundering legislation as well
as laws allowing the military to intercept unauthorized civilian
aircraft, including those suspected of smuggling drugs. The federal
police also opened a new jungle survival school in the Amazon and
have been working with the DEA for even more training.
 &HT;    In the main ports of Rio and Santos, the federal police have set
up a task force trained to look for pirates, drug smugglers and
other illegal activity. ``Because of where we are geographically,
traffickers come through here,'' explains Ricardo D. Gaspar, head
of the squad. But now smugglers may find a few more roadblocks in
their path.

traffickers in Brazil command a large complex distribution and
export system for smuggling Colombian and Bolivian cocaine into
Europe. Indeed, almost all of the 120 people recently charged with
moving drugs through the Amazon town of Tabatinga were taking
Colombian cocaine to Europe. And of the 20 foreigners Brazil has
extradited for drug-smuggling offenses, 15 were from Italy.
 &HT;    According to the DEA's report, Brazil has made some progress in
its battle against drug smuggling. In late 1998, President Cardoso
created the National Anti-Drug Secretariat (Senad) to coordinate
all counter-narcotics programs and efforts. In February, the
Brazilian Congress passed anti-money-laundering legislation as well
as laws allowing the military to intercept unauthorized civilian
aircraft, including those suspected of smuggling drugs. The federal
police also opened a new jungle survival school in the Amazon and
have been working with the DEA for even more training.
 &HT;    In the main ports of Rio and Santos, the federal police have set
up a task force trained to look for pirates, drug smugglers and
other illegal activity. ``Because of where we are geographically,
traffickers come through here,'' explains Ricardo D. Gaspar, head
of the squad. But now smugglers may find a few more roadblocks in
their path.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAO PAULO, Brasil _ No se sorprendan si Brasil recibe una
atencion excesiva este mes de marzo, durante la clasificacion anual
que hace el gobierno norteamericano de la lucha contra las drogas.
Hoy los narcotraficantes brasilenos tienen muchas opciones
logisticas a la mano.
 &HT;    Como hay mas aviones y barcos en las rutas comerciales
internacionales, cruzar la selva del Amazonas ya no es un problema.
Grandes camiones llevan el cargamento ilicito hasta la costa, donde
con la presunta colaboracion de funcionarios corruptos y el uso de
equipos de alta tecnologia, la mercancia de contrabando se envia a
Estados Unidos, Europa y otros lugares, segun recientes audiencias
del Congreso brasileno e investigaciones internacionales.
 &HT;    Que facilita todo esto? El libre comercio, segun un reciente
informe de la Direccion Maritima de Estados Unidos. El informe
afirma que el aumento del comercio entre los paises sudamericanos
no solo ha mejorado la infraestructura de transporte, sino que ``la
urgencia de facilitar el comercio y agilizar el procesamiento de la
carga'' provoca que los cargamentos se inspeccionen con menos
rigor. Por ejemplo, el informe menciona el sistema fluvial
Paraguay-Parana, que se ha convertido en una ruta popular para el
trafico de cocaina entre Bolivia y Paraguay, el sureste de Brasil,
Uruguay y Argentina.
 &HT;    Las cifras muestran un problema grave. En los cinco primeros
meses de 1999, las autoridades brasilenas confiscaron mas de la
mitad del total de seis toneladas metricas de cocaina confiscadas
en 1998. En los ultimos 10 anos, la policia ha confiscado unas 215
toneladas de drogas, 116 solo en los ultimos cuatro anos.
 &HT;    Las autoridades internacionales alertan desde hace anos sobre la
gran actividad de narcotrafico en territorio de Brasil. Pero en los
ultimos anos, segun un reciente informe de la Direccion
Antinarcoticos de Estados Unidos (DEA), el mejoramiento del sistema
de transporte fluvial del nordeste de Brasil ha alentado a los
narcotraficantes a transportar pasta de cocaina a traves de Brasil
desde las zonas de cultivo en los Andes hasta los laboratorios de
Colombia. Entretanto, en el sur, las drogas se transportan por aire
y tierra desde Bolivia y Peru hasta enlaces internacionales como
Porto Alegre, Santos y Rio de Janeiro.
 &HT;    Los narcotraficantes brasilenos tienen unos 20 aviones a su
disposicion y usan grandes haciendas de la zona amazonica,
propiedad de terratenientes ricos, segun declaraciones en recientes
audiencias del Congreso. Se piensa que uno de ellos es Hildebrando
Pascoal, expulsado del Congreso cuando lo acusaron de contrabando,
asesinato y otros delitos.
 &HT;    Las audiencias congresionales tambien han revelado problemas de
narcotrafico en el resto del pais, desde el recondito Amazonas
hasta las turisticas costas de Rio de Janeiro. ``Aqui siempre habra
trafico de drogas,'' admite Eliane da Cunha Kullmann, directora de
comunicaciones publicas de la Policia Federal de Rio.
 &HT;    A pesar de la gran cantidad de drogas confiscadas, las
operaciones antinarcoticos apenas hacen mella en el negocio. La
policia hallo recientemente un laboratorio en Para que procesaba 10
toneladas de cocaina al mes. La policia federal calcula que hay
seis vuelos diarios cargados de drogas; un avion que confiscaron
llevaba mas de 800 kilos.
 &HT;    El presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso ha admitido que la
corrupcion podria llegar a los niveles mas altos del gobierno, mas
o menos, dijo, como en Italia. Otros investigadores han descubierto
que, en efecto, es asi: segun la Interpol, Brasil ocupa el tercer
lugar, despues de Italia y Estados Unidos, entre los paises
favorecidos por la organizacion delictiva italiana conocida como
Cosa Nostra.
 &HT;    La policia italiana y la brasilena informan que los
narcotraficantes italianos en Brasil operan un complejo sistema de
distribucion y exportacion para llevar a Europa la cocaina
colombiana y boliviana. En efecto, casi todos los 120 arrestados
recientemente por transportar drogas a traves del pueblo amazonico
de Tabatinga llevaban cocaina colombiana a Europa. Y de los 20
extranjeros que Brasil ha extraditado por delitos de drogas, 15
eran italianos.
 &HT;    Segun el informe de la DEA, Brasil ha dado pasos de avance en su
lucha contra el narcotrafico. A fines de 1998, el presidente
Cardoso creo la Secretaria Nacional Antidrogas (Senad) para
coordinar todos los programas y las campanas contra los narcoticos.
En febrero, el Congreso aprobo una ley contra el lavado de dinero,
asi como leyes que permiten al ejercito interceptar aviones
civiles, incluidos los que se sospeche que lleven drogas. La
policia federal tambien abrio en el Amazonas una escuela de
supervivencia en la selva y ha trabajado con la DEA para dar mas
entrenamiento.
 &HT;    En los grandes puertos de Rio y Santos, la policia federal ha
creado un equipo especial para detectar piratas, narcotraficantes y
otros infractores. ``Debido a nuestra posicion geografica, los
traficantes pasan por aqui,'' explica Ricardo D. Gaspar, director
del escuadron. Pero ahora los contrabandistas hallaran mas
obstaculos a su paso.

ELIAN'S NEEDS UNMET, SPECIALISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Usually, they are the children of divorce, whipsawed
between mothers and fathers competing for their affection and
loyalty. Or they are wards of the state, living with foster
families while social workers decide whether to return them to
their biological parents. Or they are adoptees from other
countries, old enough to remember their first homes as they adjust
to a different culture, a new language, and unfamiliar people
raising them.
</P>
<P>
   The legal-political storm swirling around Elian Gonzalez is
unusual, perhaps even unique. But the psychological and
developmental issues involved when a 6-year-old boy is thrust into
a custody battle, or suffers the loss of a parent, or is
transplanted from his home and must adjust to a radically new one _
or all of the above _ are commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Mental-health professionals, social workers, adoption
counselors, and divorce lawyers see the effects of such
life-altering events every day. And while they say many children in
comparable circumstances go on to become healthy adults, they also
agree few children who experience trauma as profound and complex as
Elian's escape without serious psychological scars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible situation in which he's being exploited by all
sides, and it's clearly to his long-term detriment,'' says Michael
Brody, a nationally prominent specialist in childhood development
and an officer of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says they want to do what's best for the child, but
they've done nothing from the start to help him deal with the
terrible loss and dramatic change he's gone through,'' adds Brody,
who, like everyone interviewed, stressed that he was speaking in
general terms since he had never examined Elian himself. ``Will he
get over this, as they like to say he will? No. As a child
psychiatrist, the one thing I can safely say . . . based on
experience and research in the field is that he will never get over
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that he'll become dysfunctional or
emotionally debilitated. Ironically, citing studies that show a
child's treatment during his earliest years has the most lasting
effect on his development, experts say it is Elian's upbringing in
Cuba that will generally determine his capacity to deal with having
watched his mother drown, with his own harrowing journey to the
shores of Florida on an inner tube, his enforced separation from
his father, and the extraordinary attention he has received from
his relatives, others in the Cuban-American community, and the
media.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it seems unimaginable that anyone _ much less
a 6-year-old _ could emerge unscathed from such a jarring series of
events.
</P>
<P>
   Even boys and girls who endure far less distress commonly suffer
at least short-term clinical depression, according to the
specialists interviewed. And the adults around them often don't
detect it, because the main way in which children cope is to go
into denial, smiling and playing as if nothing untoward had
happened at all.
</P>
<P>
   Children wrenched from an existence they know into unfamiliar
circumstances, particularly when they understand or sense they may
be moved yet again, often grapple for the rest of their lives with
deep insecurities, questions of self-worth, and feelings of
powerlessness born of an immature comprehension of what has
happened around them. They may viscerally believe they must somehow
be responsible for causing a mother's death or a father's
estrangement, for instance, even if the situation is repeatedly
explained to them and they are explicitly told they were not at
fault in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, children in these situations frequently develop
difficulties in making or sustaining emotional bonds because their
experience is that even the people to whom they feel closest may
suddenly disappear, or at least can't be counted upon to remain an
essential, ongoing part of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-traumatic effects will manifest themselves in many
ways,'' says Joyce Maguire Pavao, the author of ``The Family of
Adoption'' and a specialist in separation and loss during
childhood. Pavao, agreeing with other therapists, says that in
addition to the obvious trauma of loss, political and familial
wrangling over his fate seems certain to take a toll on him.
</P>
<P>
   Pavao and others interviewed suggest the best solution for
helping Elian is one that doesn't seem at all likely given the
virtual state of war between Fidel Castro and the Cuban-American
community in South Florida: therapy involving all of the adults who
have been the boy's guardians during his young life and, regardless
of how the battle over his residency plays out, an upbringing akin
to an open adoption so he can stay in touch with the relatives he
loves and the experiences that have shaped him in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   That Elian appears to have received no professional counseling,
at least to determine his state of mind and assess what help he may
later need, is one indication to many observers that political
considerations and not the child's best interests have been at the
core of the maneuvering over his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe because he seems fine on the surface, no one's
apparently dealing seriously with his longer-term needs or doing
much, if anything, to address the emotional harm and the grief he
has suffered,'' says Bernard Perlmutter, director of the Children
and Youth Law Clinic at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed agree there are two even starker illustrations
of how little thought people have given to Elian's needs and to the
consequences of their behavior on the boy's psychological
development.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the ever-present horde of Cuban-American
supporters, television camera crews, journalists from around the
world, and sightseers outside the Little Havana home in which the
boy has been living with his great-uncle's family since being
rescued last Thanksgiving. All of this has occurred with the
family's apparent willingness to regularly expose the boy to the
crowds and even to bask in the attention it gives him when he comes
outside to play or wave.
</P>
<P>
   As in a custody battle during a divorce, but to a far greater
degree in this case, specialists say that highly focused attention
on children can give them a heightened sense of the power they hold
and of their importance as individuals. The situation eventually
settles, but the higher the children have elevated their sense of
themselves, the farther and harder they fall.
</P>
<P>
   The second way in which nearly all the adults around Elian have
shown a lack of understanding of his needs, according to the
specialists, is by not recognizing that children don't start
thinking abstractly until they are about 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not only highly unlikely that Elian grasps the
permanence of his mother's death _ he has alternately said on
television that he knows she died and that she's still alive
somewhere, suffering from amnesia _ but it's irresponsible nearly
to the point of abuse, in the estimation of Brody and others, for
anyone to ask Elian questions as leading and consequential as where
or with whom he wants to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absurd,'' says Pavao, who says there probably isn't a
parent anywhere whose children haven't expressed a desire to live
with other relatives, friends, or at an amusement park if they were
enjoying themselves or seeking refuge from a problem. ``But this is
a very young child . . . still in shock and in grief, and of course
he would likely say that he wants things to stay as they are. Who
wouldn't?''

   MONTREAL _ It was in the fall of 1897 that a 7-year-old Inuit
boy named Minik was delivered to New York's American Museum of
Natural History by the renowned Arctic adventurer Robert E. Peary.
The youngster was accompanied by five other ``live Eskimo
specimens,'' colorful in fur costume, who drew tens of thousands of
gawkers in a day when explorers were super-celebrities and scrutiny
of primitive societies all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, four of the Eskimos _ including Minik's father,
Qisuk _ were dead, felled by germs to which they possessed no
resistance. Another was put on a ship headed home to the far
northwestern fringe of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   That left the little boy with the solemn smile alone in the huge
metropolis. He would be poked, weighed, and measured by men of
science, ogled by the paying public, and doted on by society
ladies. But the first account of the short, sad life of New York's
Eskimo, written by a Canadian researcher and just released by a
small Vermont publishing house, describes how Minik also became the
victim of a staggeringly cruel ruse by one of the world's
preeminent museums _ a hoax brought to light when the youth, years
later, chanced upon the skeleton of his father in a museum exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Minik's anger at Peary, whom he threatened to shoot unless
Qisuk's body was returned, brought a flurry of lurid headlines at
the time. But when the Eskimo died in 1918 in New Hampshire, he had
been long forgotten _ except among his people in distant Greenland
_ and his father's bones remained part of the museum's immense
repository of artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Minik's story is told in a disturbing book that, like the Eskimo
boy himself, seemed destined for obscurity. ``Give Me My Father's
Body: The Life of Minik, The New York Eskimo'' was self-published
after its author, Kenn Harper, was unable to find a commercial
house willing to take on the tale that had become his obsession.
For 14 years he flogged copies over the counter of his general
store in Iqaluit, on Baffin Island in the Canadian far north.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could also buy it at a place in Nuuk, Greenland, and a
store in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories,'' said the 55-year-old
Ontario man, who has worked for 34 years as a teacher and
businessman in Eskimo settlements of Canada and Greenland. ``Not
exactly Barnes and Noble.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the first commercial edition of the book _ published by
Vermont's Steerforth Press, which paid roughly $175,000 for ``Give
Me My Father's Body'' after an intense bidding war _ is arriving in
bookstores across North America, to the museum's apparent
displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Book of the Month Club has selected the historical account
for its April list; Pocket Books won paperback rights; and Academy
Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey, who wrote the new foreword, has
secured the movie option.
</P>
<P>
   It is a startling success for a macabre tale of looted
skeletons, of freebooting rapacity by prominent figures of Arctic
exploration, and of the conquest of the polar north as seen through
the eyes of the Inuit, as many of today's Eskimos prefer to be
called.
</P>
<P>
   Most controversially, the book paints an unlovely portrait of
two American icons: the widely respected museum and Peary, who in
1909 led the first expedition to the North Pole. The explorer,
according to Harper's book, stole Eskimo corpses from Arctic
resting places, turning a healthy sum on the sale of remains to the
museum. Harper's book also documents Peary's removal of three
meteorites held sacred by Eskimos, and evidence that he peddled
other looted relics. Such skullduggery in the name of science was
commissioned, in part, by the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peary epitomized the greed and arrogance that was typical of
white explorers during the Golden Age of Arctic exploration,'' said
Harper from Iqaluit. ``Although he admired the northern survival
skills of the Eskimos, he had no affinity for them as a people, no
real respect for their culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Peary and other turn-of-the-century luminaries,
including esteemed anthropologist Franz Boas, appear little better
than high-minded grave robbers, pursuing knowledge with a lack of
cultural sensitivity that seems shocking from the vantage of modern
times.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the book occurs as many museums in the United
States, including the Museum of Natural History, are feeling heat
from aboriginal groups demanding the return of bones and other
relics taken by scientists. Hundreds of native skeletons are
believed to rest in dusty storage vaults or meticulously labeled
display drawers in scores of museums.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest part of Harper's book tells how the museum
deliberately tricked the then 8-year-old boy into thinking his
father, Qisuk, had received the burial demanded by Inuit custom.
``Incredible as it may seem,'' the author writes, ``the scientists
at the (museum) staged a phony funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre ruse, officials solemnly interred a log wrapped in
ceremonial cloth in the museum garden, then _ keeping with Inuit
ritual _ heaped the ``grave'' with stones as a weeping Minik
watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy never suspected,'' Harper quotes William Wallace, a
museum superintendent who adopted Minik. ``When the grave was
complete he made his mark on the north side of it. You see that is
the Eskimo way.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Qisuk's body was the subject of a tug of war
between the museum and Bellevue Hospital's College of Physicians
and Surgeons, each wanting the honor of examining the exotic
corpse. In the end, the doctors dissected the body and pickled the
brain in a specimen jar; the museum won rights to the Eskimo's
bones _ stripping them, bleaching them in a vat usually used for
animal remains, and slathering them with lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   Minik, unaware of the desecration, was raised by Wallace's
family. He learned English, studied reptiles, played baseball _ and
lost all memory of his Inuktitut language. Then, in 1907, during a
visit to the museum, he made a devastating discovery: his father's
bones in a display case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw myself at the bottom of the glass case and prayed and
wept,'' he would later describe the moment. ``I went straight to
the director and implored him to let me bury my father. He would
not. I swore I would never rest until I had given my father
burial.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers trumpeted the scandal coast-to-coast. Minik railed
publicly against the man he held responsible: ``Peary's Neglected
Eskimo Boy Wants To Shoot Him,'' proclaimed a headline in the San
Francisco Examiner. The hoopla caused great embarrassment for
Peary, who was especially alarmed that the Eskimo would divulge
that the explorer, a married man, had fathered two children by
Inuit women during Arctic sojourns.
</P>
<P>
   Minik was hustled back to Greenland, but within a few years was
pining for the United States. ``He was a young man caught between
two worlds, yearning for the city lights as much as the northern
lights,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   So Minik returned to America, winding up in Pittsburg, N.H.,
where he worked as a lumberjack and made close friends. But his
newfound happiness was brief _ he died in the Spanish flu pandemic
in 1918, age 27 or 28. He lies beneath a simple headstone not far
from the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Natural History still adamantly denies any
wrongdoing, and for decades refused to relinquish native remains.
In 1993, however, following renewed controversy triggered by
Harper's book, the institution repatriated the skeletons of four
Eskimos, including Qisuk, to Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   They are buried in the Lutheran cemetery at Qaanaaq, beneath a
plaque inscribed in the Inuit language, ``They Have Come Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials, meanwhile, last month acknowledged that the
remains of seven other Inuit _ including a mother, father, and
little girl whose bones were disinterred by Peary _ remain part of
its vast collection.

<P>
   MONTREAL _ Like the needle of a compass, Kenn Harper's yearnings
have always pointed due north. After graduating from teachers'
school in his native Ontario, he volunteered in 1966 for a school
posting in the Inuit, or Eskimo, hamlet of Broughton Island, in
Canada's eastern Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   But with 250 souls, including 12 other whites, the settlement
was simply too big and _ what with its Hudson's Bay Co. trading
store and Royal Canadian Mounted Police outpost _ just too
urbanized to satisfy Harper.
</P>
<P>
   So he moved with his wife and infant son to Padloping Island, an
entirely Inuit settlement, population 34. ``No church, no store, no
nothing but the one room I used for the school,'' Harper recalled.
``That was more like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for the marriage, it wasn't; his family fled a few months
later, stunned by the cold and isolation. But Harper was in
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Like most longtime northerners, Harper, now 55, has been a jack
of all trades: teacher, development officer, linguist, storeowner,
and compiler of a dictionary of Inuktitut, an Eskimo language. ``In
my heart, I'm a historian,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He married a Greenland Inuit, and it was during a 1977 visit to
the village of Qaanaaq that he first heard of Minik. ``My
mother-in-law, Amaunnalik, knew Minik as a child,'' he said. ``The
elders recalled him. But the tales they told seemed fantastic and
improbable.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper spent years in an obsessive quest for the story,
traveling as far as Copenhagen. ``My search ended in Pittsburg,
N.H., where Minik died,'' he said. ``Seeing Minik's final resting
place was a very emotional moment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of New York's American Museum of Natural History,
stung by Harper's account, have pleaded that the moral standards of
today should not be applied to yesterday's actions. But Harper is
unswayed: ``Staging a fake burial to fool a little boy was as wrong
100 years ago as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper today is a businessman in Iqaluit, population 5000,
capital of the new Inuit territory of Nunavut and 180 miles below
the Arctic Circle. ``It's the biggest place I've lived in 34
years,'' he said. ``And certainly the most southerly.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Who's not fit to raise Elian?
 &HT;    (For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There seemingly is no end to the hideous soap opera
surrounding the 6-year-old Cuban political pawn Elian Gonzalez.
There will be an end, of course, and the sooner the better. But for
the time being, it gets more ugly by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the crowd of lawyers who surround Elian and his Miami
family fanned out to play the network TV talk shows. From their
prattle emerged a picture that Elian's father is unfit to care for
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   About the worst we know regarding the father is that he is a
communist _ and we're not even certain about that. Nevertheless,
being a communist, while deplorable to most of us, isn't even
illegal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The charge that the father is unfit is a pre-emptive act that
cloaks a question as to whether the Miami family is fit to care for
the child _ and that is a legitimate question!
</P>
<P>
   While there is no available record for Juan Miguel Gonzalez _
the father _ there are several for the Miami Gonzalezes; and
``record'' is the functional term.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, The New York Times revealed that 49-year-old Lazaro
Gonzalez, the auto mechanic great-uncle who has possession of
Elian, has a nasty record of drunk driving and driver's license
revocation.
</P>
<P>
   While communism isn't illegal in this country, and certainly not
in Cuba, drunk driving is _ in both places.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
records, The New York Times revealed that Lazaro Gonzalez, who did
not arrive in the U.S. until 1985, has four convictions for drunk
driving in Florida and that his driver's license was revoked or
suspended for a total of three years. The paper also said the
great-uncle completed an alcohol treatment course in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the paper cited his brother Delfin who, while living in
the Florida Keys, also has spent considerable time at the Miami
house with Elian. Delfin Gonzalez has four Florida convictions for
drunk driving, two involving property damage or personal injury.
The Times says Delfin Gonzalez's license also had been revoked for
a period of two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald reported those same findings two days later but
not on its front page as did The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks prior to the New York Times article, the Miami New
Times, an alternative newspaper with a deserved reputation for
muckraking investigative reporting, reported that two of Elian's
cousins, Jose and Luis Cid of Miami _ twin sons of Lazaro's sister
_ have had brushes with the law. Both also frequent the Gonzalez
house.
</P>
<P>
   According to that paper, which cited police and court records,
Luis Cid was arrested last September and charged with strong-arm
robbery of a tourist. In 1994, Luis Cid also was charged with
carrying a concealed weapon and resisting arrest with violence. His
ex-wife charged him with domestic violence and he was arrested
another time for what the newspaper termed ``felony firearms and
prowling charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Cid's twin brother, Jose, was arrested five times between
1986 and 1990 on charges varying from burglary to grand theft and
robbery with force.
</P>
<P>
   When this news was published in the Miami New Times, with an
admission that the paper was not able to unearth whether there were
convictions, Lazaro Gonzalez, through a spokesman, said he had
never before had any knowledge of the eight combined arrests of his
sister's sons.
</P>
<P>
   With that collective baggage to tote, isn't it surprising that
the Miami Gonzalez family lawyers would want to promote an argument
on who is fit to care for Elian?

<P>
   Dr. Ronald Livesey couldn't help but feel a little like an
outlaw. Perhaps it was the syringe, the vial of clear liquid and
the alcohol swipe wrapped in aluminum foil. Perhaps it was the fact
that he was sitting in his underwear on a toilet in a strange hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the syringe almost parallel to his thigh, Livesey, 54,
felt a tiny prick of pain as he gently inserted it just under the
skin. He thought to himself, ``Now I know how a junkie must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't heroin that Livesey was shooting up, but something
called human growth hormone. He spent the weekend playing tourist
in Palm Springs, Calif., where the clinic he'd visited was located.
On Sunday night he boarded a plane for San Francisco, where he was
to attend a conference on internal medicine, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Livesey returned to work at Dartmouth Medical
School's Hitchcock Clinic in Manchester, N.H., he was injecting
himself twice a day. But he didn't tell his fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I would get a reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first month people started noticing: ``You've sure
got a spring in your step,'' they'd say, or ``You're really looking
well these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Livesey wondered how much of this was due to the
placebo effect. But time, he says, has proven otherwise. Three and
a half years after his first visit to the clinic, Livesey has lost
nearly 50 pounds, dropped four inches in his waist and built up 12
pounds of muscle in his upper body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the doctor was so overwhelmed by the changes he saw in
himself that he decided to move to New York and start a practice
specializing in this new therapy that has changed his life:
anti-aging medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made incredible progress,'' says his partner, Dr. Joseph
Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was
40 or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, or hGH, is fast growing in popularity.
Even though the drug typically costs $1,000 a month, at least
10,000 people have begun taking it for anti-aging purposes, says
Dr. Ronald Katz, president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this stuff? Produced by the pituitary gland, human
growth hormone helps maintain tissues and organs, build muscle mass
and reduce fat, keep bones strong and enhance mood and mental
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, hGH levels start slacking off at about age 30.
Anti-aging doctors believe that by returning hormone levels to
those of a 25- or 30-year-old, the age when bodies function at
their peak, we can slow and possibly reverse the effects of age.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging doctors also prescribe sex hormones, adrenal gland
hormones, thyroid supplements and melatonin, if patients are
``deficient'' in those areas. The good ones generally recommend a
diet and exercise regimen to complement the hormones, and many sell
their own nutritional supplements, or ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is attracting all sorts of fans. Diane Gilman, 54,
a New York fashion designer who sells her collections to Saks Fifth
Avenue and Nordstrom as well as on the Home Shopping Network,
injects herself with hGH twice a day. ``I feel like I'm 30. I can
get two to three hours of sleep and wake up feeling like a million
bucks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Maffei, 40, an abstract painter from Fishkill, N.Y., was
worried that he'd run out of gas before he managed to really get
his career off the ground. (He earns most of his income as a
plasterer, but he was able to find a cheap hGH supplier on the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at Country Buffet, charging the steam table
for food with all the other senior citizens,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be isolated with the blue-hair set.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors like Nick Nolte and Dixie Carter admit to using hGH too.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were scarce _ the drug had to be extracted from human
cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human
growth hormone in 1985. While not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for anti-aging purposes, doctors can prescribe it
for anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, founded in Chicago in 1992. The group
now has 8,400 members and has developed its own certification exam.
In order to qualify, a doctor must be either an M.D. or a doctor of
osteopathy and have five years of clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   A4M President Ronald Klatz says it takes two and a half years to
complete the testing process and that there are 460 doctors who
have done so or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual A4M conference, held at the Tropicana Hotel
in Las Vegas, attracted 5,040 attendees _ a hundredfold increase
since its first conference in 1993 _ and 450 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a crowd? There's a good chance it has a lot to do with
money. Ten thousand baby boomers turn 50 each day, meaning that the
market for anti-aging therapy may soon be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mintz, a board-certified radiologist, founded the
Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas just two years ago. With
close to 600 patients, it's probably the country's largest
anti-aging clinic. They come from some 40 states and eight
countries to undergo an all-day medical evaluation and begin an
anti-aging program that generally consists of hormone replacement,
nutritional and other supplements, and diet and exercise
counseling. The average fee? Between $500 and $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous economic opportunity in this,'' Mintz says.
``Our goal is to do an IPO in three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the company has launched an ambitious
``physician partner'' program to extend the Cenegenics name and
program to physicians across the country. (The partners use
Cenegenics' medical protocols and its marketing and billing
services; Cenegenics expands its patient base.) So far 58 doctors
have signed up. Mintz believes that most of the clinic's growth
will come from this program.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

   Dr. Ronald Livesey couldn't help but feel a little like an
outlaw. Perhaps it was the syringe, the vial of clear liquid and
the alcohol swipe wrapped in aluminum foil. Perhaps it was the fact
that he was sitting in his underwear on a toilet in a strange hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the syringe almost parallel to his thigh, Livesey, 54,
felt a tiny prick of pain as he gently inserted it just under the
skin. He thought to himself, ``Now I know how a junkie must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't heroin that Livesey was shooting up, but something
called human growth hormone. He spent the weekend playing tourist
in Palm Springs, Calif., where the clinic he'd visited was located.
On Sunday night he boarded a plane for San Francisco, where he was
to attend a conference on internal medicine, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Livesey returned to work at Dartmouth Medical
School's Hitchcock Clinic in Manchester, N.H., he was injecting
himself twice a day. But he didn't tell his fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I would get a reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first month people started noticing: ``You've sure
got a spring in your step,'' they'd say, or ``You're really looking
well these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Livesey wondered how much of this was due to the
placebo effect. But time, he says, has proven otherwise. Three and
a half years after his first visit to the clinic, Livesey has lost
nearly 50 pounds, dropped four inches in his waist and built up 12
pounds of muscle in his upper body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the doctor was so overwhelmed by the changes he saw in
himself that he decided to move to New York and start a practice
specializing in this new therapy that has changed his life:
anti-aging medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made incredible progress,'' says his partner, Dr. Joseph
Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was
40 or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, or hGH, is fast growing in popularity.
Even though the drug typically costs $1,000 a month, at least
10,000 people have begun taking it for anti-aging purposes, says
Dr. Ronald Katz, president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this stuff? Produced by the pituitary gland, human
growth hormone helps maintain tissues and organs, build muscle mass
and reduce fat, keep bones strong and enhance mood and mental
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, hGH levels start slacking off at about age 30.
Anti-aging doctors believe that by returning hormone levels to
those of a 25- or 30-year-old, the age when bodies function at
their peak, we can slow and possibly reverse the effects of age.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging doctors also prescribe sex hormones, adrenal gland
hormones, thyroid supplements and melatonin, if patients are
``deficient'' in those areas. The good ones generally recommend a
diet and exercise regimen to complement the hormones, and many sell
their own nutritional supplements, or ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is attracting all sorts of fans. Diane Gilman, 54,
a New York fashion designer who sells her collections to Saks Fifth
Avenue and Nordstrom as well as on the Home Shopping Network,
injects herself with hGH twice a day. ``I feel like I'm 30. I can
get two to three hours of sleep and wake up feeling like a million
bucks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Maffei, 40, an abstract painter from Fishkill, N.Y., was
worried that he'd run out of gas before he managed to really get
his career off the ground. (He earns most of his income as a
plasterer, but he was able to find a cheap hGH supplier on the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at Country Buffet, charging the steam table
for food with all the other senior citizens,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be isolated with the blue-hair set.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors like Nick Nolte and Dixie Carter admit to using hGH too.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>

cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human

Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono
Laboratories, the U.S. subsidiary of Swiss drugmaker Ares-Serono.
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn's Genotropin is the top-selling hGH worldwide,
with $461 million in sales in 1999. Eli Lilly sold $297 million of
its product, Humatrope, worldwide in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But hGH accounts for only a fraction of overall sales at these
companies. Both Mintz and Bruce Nadler think there's a better
option for investors: Bio-Technology General. It manufactures
Bio-Tropin, which is sold in 35 countries worldwide and accounted
for 29 percent of the company's overall 1999 sales.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   More energy. A more youthful body. The promise of an active old
age. So what's the downside?
</P>
<P>
   The side effects, for starters. They include joint pain and
carpal tunnel syndrome, and in some cases diabetes and fluid
retention in blood vessels, which can lead to high blood pressure
and heart failure. Most of this can generally be controlled by
changing the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   Other things can't: Nadler has treated more than a few
bodybuilders who, having used hGH to pump up, went way beyond the
prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like Cro-Magnon man,'' he reports. ``Once you get
up into that level, you get this frontal bossing. The forehead
comes out. The jaw starts to grow; even your internal organs start
to grow. Once it occurs, it doesn't revert, even if you go off the
growth hormone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most users, there's a much bigger long-term concern:
cancer. The fact is, human growth hormone makes things grow.
Patients are carefully screened for existing cancers before
beginning therapy, but what about preexisting cancer cells that are
undetectable by current diagnostics?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's evidence that growth hormone, whether given in the
body or to the cells directly, can increase the propagation of
preexisting cancer cells,'' says Johns Hopkins's Marc Blackman.
``It would be imprudent to recommend it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Perls, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School,
thinks all of us have succumbed to negative hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are promoting this paint a terrible picture of
aging,'' says the author of ``Living to 100,'' which examines why
centenarians live to such an old age. (Good genes play the major
role.) ``It's as if aging and infirmity and death are all
interchangeable. Anti-aging is really just anti-old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the question of cost _ which is quite high. To
patients who are worried about the steep price tag of human growth
hormone, anti-aging doctors say reassuringly, ``Wait until 2002
when the patents start to expire. Generics will flood the market,
and the cost will really come down.''
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that simple. When generic competition comes, it
will very likely lower prices. But the FDA must approve any generic
drug sold in the United States, and there are no generic biologic
drugs on the market at all. Companies can't market hGH as an
anti-aging drug _ and the subsequent competition can't push down
prices _ unless they present data from clinical trials showing the
drug is successful in such treatment. None of the drug companies
have done that testing.
</P>
<P>
   For William Jones, it's more a question of the size of his
estate. ``One has to reapportion one's assets and income to cover
this expense,'' the doctor says. ``But you can't take it with you.
My kids are pretty much through their education. I could just keep
salting it away and put it in a larger and larger estate. But for
me, this is such a positive thing to do.'' He pauses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stick up a 7-Eleven to get the money if I had to.'' &QL;

<P>
   Dr. Ronald Livesey couldn't help but feel a little like an
outlaw. Perhaps it was the syringe, the vial of clear liquid and
the alcohol swipe wrapped in aluminum foil. Perhaps it was the fact
that he was sitting in his underwear on a toilet in a strange hotel
room.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the syringe almost parallel to his thigh, Livesey, 54,
felt a tiny prick of pain as he gently inserted it just under the
skin. He thought to himself, ``Now I know how a junkie must feel.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't heroin that Livesey was shooting up, but something
called human growth hormone. He spent the weekend playing tourist
in Palm Springs, Calif., where the clinc he'd visited was located.
On Sunday night he boarded a plane for San Francisco, where he was
to attend a conference on internal medicine, his specialty.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Livesey returned to work at Dartmouth Medical
School's Hitchcock Clinic in Manchester, N.H., he was injecting
himself twice a day. But he didn't tell his fellow doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see if I would get a reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first month people started noticing: ``You've sure
got a spring in your step,'' they'd say, or ``You're really looking
well these days.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Livesey wondered how much of this was due to the
placebo effect. But time, he says, has proven otherwise. Three and
a half years after his first visit to the clinic, Livesey has lost
nearly 50 pounds, dropped four inches in his waist and built up 12
pounds of muscle in his upper body.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the doctor was so overwhelmed by the changes he saw in
himself that he decided to move to New York and start a practice
specializing in this new therapy that has changed his life:
anti-aging medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made incredible progress,'' says his partner, Dr. Joseph
Raffaele. ``If you saw him from the neck down, you'd think he was
40 or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   Human growth hormone, or hGH, is fast growing in popularity.
Even though the drug typically costs $1,000 a month, at least
10,000 people have begun taking it for anti-aging purposes, says
Dr. Ronald Katz, president of the American Academy of Anti-Aging
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   So what is this stuff? Produced by the pituitary gland, human
growth hormone helps maintain tissues and organs, build muscle mass
and reduce fat, keep bones strong and enhance mood and mental
acuity.
</P>
<P>
   In most people, hGH levels start slacking off at about age 30.
Anti-aging doctors believe that by returning hormone levels to
those of a 25- or 30-year-old, the age when bodies function at
their peak, we can slow and possibly reverse the effects of age.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-aging doctors also prescribe sex hormones, adrenal gland
hormones, thyroid supplements and melatonin, if patients are
``deficient'' in those areas. The good ones generally recommend a
diet and exercise regimen to complement the hormones, and many sell
their own nutritional supplements, or ``nutriceuticals.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is attracting all sorts of fans. Diane Gilman, 54,
a New York fashion designer who sells her collections to Saks Fifth
Avenue and Nordstrom as well as on the Home Shopping Network,
injects herself with hGH twice a day. ``I feel like I'm 30. I can
get two to three hours of sleep and wake up feeling like a million
bucks,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Maffei, 40, an abstract painter from Fishkill, N.Y., was
worried that he'd run out of gas before he managed to really get
his career off the ground. (He earns most of his income as a
plasterer, but he was able to find a cheap hGH supplier on the
Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at Country Buffet, charging the steam table
for food with all the other senior citizens,'' he says. ``I don't
want to be isolated with the blue-hair set.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors like Nick Nolte and Dixie Carter admit to using hGH too.
</P>
<P>
   .....
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the chief candidates for human growth
hormone replacement were children who had a growth-hormone
deficiency and, more recently, AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies were scarce _ the drug had to be extracted from human
cadavers _ until Genentech introduced the first bioengineered human
growth hormone in 1985. While not approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for anti-aging purposes, doctors can prescribe it
for anything they want.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of the movement is the American Academy of
Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, founded in Chicago in 1992. The group
now has 8,400 members and has developed its own certification exam.
In order to qualify, a doctor must be either an M.D. or a doctor of
osteopathy and have five years of clinical practice.
</P>
<P>
   A4M President Ronald Klatz says it takes two and a half years to
complete the testing process and that there are 460 doctors who
have done so or are in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's annual A4M conference, held at the Tropicana Hotel
in Las Vegas, attracted 5,040 attendees _ a hundredfold increase
since its first conference in 1993 _ and 450 exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a crowd? There's a good chance it has a lot to do with
money. Ten thousand baby boomers turn 50 each day, meaning that the
market for anti-aging therapy may soon be extremely lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mintz, a board-certified radiologist, founded the
Cenegenics Medical Institute in Las Vegas just two years ago. With
close to 600 patients, it's probably the country's largest
anti-aging clinic. They come from some 40 states and eight
countries to undergo an all-day medical evaluation and begin an
anti-aging program that generally consists of hormone replacement,
nutritional and other supplements, and diet and exercise
counseling. The average fee? Between $500 and $600 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see enormous economic opportunity in this,'' Mintz says.
``Our goal is to do an IPO in three to four years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year the company has launched an ambitious
``physician partner'' program to extend the Cenegenics name and
program to physicians across the country. (The partners use
Cenegenics' medical protocols and its marketing and billing
services; Cenegenics expands its patient base.) So far 58 doctors
have signed up. Mintz believes that most of the clinic's growth
will come from this program.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to invest in hGH without opening a clinic?
There are five drug companies that sell hGH in the United States:
Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Novo Nordisk and Serono

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Who's not fit to raise Elian?
 &HT;    (For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There seemingly is no end to the hideous soap opera
surrounding the 6-year-old Cuban political pawn Elian Gonzalez.
There will be an end, of course, and the sooner the better. But for
the time being, it gets more ugly by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the crowd of lawyers who surround Elian and his Miami
family fanned out to play the network TV talk shows. From their
prattle emerged a picture that Elian's father is unfit to care for
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   About the worst we know regarding the father is that he is a
communist _ and we're not even certain about that. Nevertheless,
being a communist, while deplorable to most of us, isn't even
illegal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The charge that the father is unfit is a pre-emptive act that
cloaks a question as to whether the Miami family is fit to care for
the child _ and that is a legitimate question!
</P>
<P>
   While there is no available record for Juan Miguel Gonzalez _
the father _ there are several for the Miami Gonzalezes; and
``record'' is the functional term.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, The New York Times revealed that 49-year-old Lazaro
Gonzalez, the auto mechanic great-uncle who has possession of
Elian, has a nasty record of drunk driving and driver's license
revocation.
</P>
<P>
   While communism isn't illegal in this country, and certainly not
in Cuba, drunk driving is _ in both places.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles
records, The New York Times revealed that Lazaro Gonzalez, who did
not arrive in the U.S. until 1985, has four convictions for drunk
driving in Florida and that his driver's license was revoked or
suspended for a total of three years. The paper also said the
great-uncle completed an alcohol treatment course in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the paper cited his brother Delfin who, while living in
the Florida Keys, also has spent considerable time at the Miami
house with Elian. Delfin Gonzalez has four Florida convictions for
drunk driving, two involving property damage or personal injury.
The Times says Delfin Gonzalez's license also had been revoked for
a period of two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald reported those same findings two days later but
not on its front page as did The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks prior to the New York Times article, the Miami New
Times, an alternative newspaper with a deserved reputation for
muckraking investigative reporting, reported that two of Elian's
cousins, Jose and Luis Cid of Miami _ twin sons of Lazaro's sister
_ have had brushes with the law. Both also frequent the Gonzalez
house.
</P>
<P>
   According to that paper, which cited police and court records,
Luis Cid was arrested last September and charged with strong-arm
robbery of a tourist. In 1994, Luis Cid also was charged with
carrying a concealed weapon and resisting arrest with violence. His
ex-wife charged him with domestic violence and he was arrested
another time for what the newspaper termed ``felony firearms and
prowling charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Cid's twin brother, Jose, was arrested five times between
1986 and 1990 on charges varying from burglary to grand theft and
robbery with force.
</P>
<P>
   When this news was published in the Miami New Times, with an
admission that the paper was not able to unearth whether there were
convictions, Lazaro Gonzalez, through a spokesman, said he had
never before had any knowledge of the eight combined arrests of his
sister's sons.
</P>
<P>
   With that collective baggage to tote, isn't it surprising that
the Miami Gonzalez family lawyers would want to promote an argument
on who is fit to care for Elian?

CONFLICT LEAVES HEARTS HARDENED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a land where both sides see themselves as
victims, Palestinians and Israelis often fail to recognize the
suffering of the other.
</P>
<P>
   This tragic axiom of the half-century of conflict here was
captured in a disturbing light last month as Palestinians reacted
to Pope John Paul II's emotional visit to Israel's Holocaust
memorial during his pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, on a muddy hillside overlooking the Sea of Galilee
while the pontiff presided over an outdoor Mass, James Kajjo, 26, a
Palestinian from Jerusalem, was coldly unmoved by John Paul's call
for Roman Catholic reconciliation with Jews, and for recognition of
Jews' suffering in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler was a good man. Look at what they (Nazi Germany) did to
raise up their country under him,'' said Kajjo, a Roman Catholic
who is college educated and who runs a family printing business.
``If he had killed more we would be much better off. I am not the
only Palestinian who believes this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kajjo's sentiments are commonplace among Palestinians. This kind
of dismissal of the Holocaust, or claim that it is an exaggeration
crop up in many corners of the Palestinian community _ on its
university campuses, in taxi cabs, in its newspapers, and in its
Parliament. The fate of Jews in the Holocaust is virtually absent
from Palestinian high school and college history books.
</P>
<P>
   This not only offends Israelis but serves to undermine the
confidence both sides need to share for the peace process to
succeed. In Israel, where some 300,000 Holocaust survivors live, to
deny or minimize the Nazi genocide is to contradict decades of
research validated by the world's most respected historians, and in
effect to deny the modern history of the Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the 6 million Jews killed in Nazi death camps, Kajjo
called the figure ``Zionist propaganda.'' He said he was aware that
``Jews and other people'' were killed, but ``not that many.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want me to do? Cry? Because I can't,'' said Kajjo,
even as the pope's voice carried in the background. ``What did
Palestinians have to do with the Holocaust?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if, as a Catholic, his statements flouted the pope's
message, he replied bitterly, ``The pope lives in Rome, and I live
under occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   These raw views of history came up repeatedly in lengthy
interviews with a random sampling of 12 young Palestinians
encountered along the path of the pope's pilgrimage last month.
Eleven of the students _ a mix of Muslims and Christians from
Israel and the West Bank _ saw the Holocaust as an exaggeration
used as propaganda by Zionists. Nearly half the students said they
saw Hitler in some positive ways. Three said they agreed with
killing Jews in the Nazis' ``final solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Lena Qassem, 22, a Muslim from Nazareth, is in her third year of
medical school at Hebrew University and was trying to catch a
glimpse of the pope as his motorcade passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews were victims of the Shoah. And we have been the
victims of the Jews,'' Qassem said. ``We think the Jews exaggerate.
It was an ugly part of history, but it was not as bad as they show
it all the time on television and in books. They control the media.
So they can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Palestinians, it is another holocaust. Their homes
were taken, their lives. What the Jews lived through was bad, but
it is over. The Palestinian holocaust is now. People cry every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are preoccupied with their own suffering, the
plight of 3.5 million refugees, their lives under Israeli
occupation in the West Bank, a peace process that has done little
to change difficult lives, and the uprooting of their culture by
creation of the Jewish state. They only rarely, and reluctantly,
look at how Jews suffered in the Holocaust. Many say they have
suffered in Israel because the West, guilt-laden by its failure to
prevent the Holocaust, has been hesitant to criticize Israeli
violations of international law.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiments are jarring, and seemed particularly so when
uttered by the Palestinian Liberation Organization's chief Muslim
cleric on the eve of his meeting with the pope in Jerusalem's Dome
of the Rock, one of the holiest sites in Islam, during the pope's
interfaith journey through the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six million? It was a lot less,'' said grand mufti Ikrima
Sabri, who is appointed by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in an
interview published by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my fault Hitler hated the Jews. Anyway, they hate
them just about everywhere,'' he added, sentiments he repeated in
interviews with the Associated Press and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli analysts pointed out that such attitudes are woven
into Palestinians' history. During World War II, Sabri's
predecessor as grand mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed al-Husseini,
supported the Nazi war effort.
</P>
<P>
   Afif Safieh, a Palestinian Catholic and the PLO's general
delegate to the Vatican, said Sabri's comments were taken out of
context, and he reacted furiously to a reporter's question about
them, saying that even to ask was ``guerrilla work'' by the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the immensity and horror of the Holocaust. Whatever the
number, it was horrible. But I also have lived the horror of the
Palestinian holocaust. . . . How do we measure pain? How do we
measure suffering?'' Safieh asked.
</P>
<P>
   That the Palestinian leadership was unwilling to criticize Sabri
for his comments disappointed many Israelis and members of the
Roman Catholic hierarchy accompanying the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Such comments from Palestinians supposed to be among the
enlightened leaders of their people enrage Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Segev, a controversial historian who wrote the explosive
1993 book, ``The Seventh Million: the Israelis and the Holocaust,''
has criticized his homeland for using and sometimes abusing the
memory of the Holocaust for political gain. He dismisses Holocaust
denial in Europe and America as ``a kind of pornography'' that
should be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Arab Holocaust denial is more troubling,'' said Segev,
``because you cannot understand Israel unless you understand the
Holocaust. And you cannot make peace with your enemy unless you
understand him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arabs, by recognizing that Jews are victims, feel it takes
away from their victimhood. And this competition for who has the
market on victimization has been going on for many years. Too
many.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There cannot be real peace until Israelis understand the
Palestinian tragedy, and Palestinians understand the Israeli
tragedy,'' Segev added. ``That is not to say that these two
sufferings are comparable. They are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Ahmed, a Palestinian professor of political science at
Ber Zeit University and a community activist in the Dheishe Refugee
Camp that the pope visited, said he has heard such vicious views
among many students in the classroom. But he said they had to be
seen in light of a traumatized people who feel the world has never
recognized their plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a common mistake of Westerners who come here, to hear
comments like this and exaggerate their importance,'' Ahmed said.
``You have to understand the sentiment, not the words. This
expresses anger, it is a rough way of saying, `Look at what has
happened to us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed and other Palestinian academics agree that the views
expressed by young Palestinians grow out of ignorance of history.
Virtually no history classes in Palestinian schools in the West
Bank and Gaza (which follow a Jordanian curriculum), teach about
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Itimar Marcus, an Israeli member of the anti-incitement
committee of Israelis, Palestinians, and Americans established as a
result of the peace process, has extensively researched the
Palestinian school system and its textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we find is outrageous,'' Marcus said. ``They refer to
World War II, to Nazis, to the rise of Hitler and its racism. But
there is no mention of 6 million Jews being killed. There are,
however, repeated comparisons to Israel and fascism, and often in
vulgar fashion. So there is no outright denial, there is just
complete avoidance, as if it did not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian and even some Israeli academics say Israel has, in
turn, denied Palestinian suffering in teaching history, avoiding
confronting the ways in which Palestinians were victimized. Only in
the last year have Israeli high school textbooks taken on the other
side of history in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And only in
the last few years have the views of so-called ``revisionist
historians'' begun to expose Israel's forced expulsions of
Palestinians in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and challenged some of
Israel's founding myths, such as the slogan ``A land without people
for a people without land.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Palestinians living within the 1948 boundaries of
Israel, who grew up in the Israeli school system, had a much more
informed and balanced view of history.
</P>
<P>
   Ehab Saaba, 27, a Palestinian from a village near Haifa,
attended Israeli schools with Jews, Muslims, and Christians, and he
said he was sickened to hear some of the comments by young
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitler was a killer. Period. Anyone who says anything else is
ignorant,'' Saaba said.
</P>
<P>
   On the same hillside where Kajjo made his comments, a group of
German Catholic pilgrims clustered, seemingly depressed and
saddened by the views some Palestinians were voicing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe there are people out there capable of thinking
that way,'' said Manfard Bastel, 35, of Munich. ``Even today, even
after the pope's message here, even after all we have seen in our
own history.''

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ There seemingly is no end to the
hideous soap opera surrounding the 6-year-old Cuban political pawn
Elian Gonzalez. There will be an end, of course, and the sooner the
better. But for the time being, it gets more ugly by the hour.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN - This morning, by popular demand and in
accordance with Village Ordinance 2791-3 (enacted to keep ugliness
off the streets), I went to the beauty parlor. It was a bust. The
hair came out okay, but it made the rest of me look bad. I keep
telling Karen it must be the lights. I've begged her to ditch the
daylight fluorescents and screw in some of those nice pink bulbs -
the ones that softly shave 10 years off the face in the mirror. She
says if she did that, hair colors in our town would turn freaky -

<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN - WACO, Texas - No matter how ugly the speech,
it's far worse for Congress to make a law that abridges the
public's free-speech rights. Since the Constitution forbids
Congress from making laws that abridge constitutional rights,
Congress members are trying to change the U.S. Constitution with an

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The pandering vice president
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the history of pandering is written, perhaps Al Gore's
swoon for Miami's anti-Castro zealots will rate no more than a
heavy footnote. The jostling for place is, after all, fierce these
days.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it is ultimately judged one of the great grovels or
just a standard political one, the vice president's pander is
especially pernicious. Going beyond mere conscienceless trolling
for votes, Gore's about-face in the matter of Elian Gonzalez
back-stabs the president and knee-caps the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Where he once supported letting the law takes its course, Gore
now says he favors giving the 6-year-old boy resident status so the
issue of his custody might be settled in a Florida family court
with arguments over whether the boy would be better off staying
with his relatives there or being returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, it's tough to guess how a Florida court might rule on that
one.
</P>
<P>
   The political glamour of Gore maybe, just maybe, stealing
Florida from George W. Bush right under his governor brother's nose
is dazzling. But the vice president does the larger stature of his
candidacy no honor with this maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, Gore's precedent would undermine the hopes of
aggrieved Americans seeking to recover children who have been taken
abroad, usually by an estranged parent.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimates 16,500
victims of parental kidnapping are taken abroad annually. The State
Department is handling 1,000-plus cases currently. (A two-way
street: The department has returned 700 children to foreign parents
since September 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   Under both the Hague Convention and U.S. law, only Elian's
father has the legal right to speak on his behalf, the point the
Clinton administration has been making all along and one now
confirmed by specific court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The grand hullabaloo over Elian has become a political obscenity
that, pursuing its own momentum, pays no attention to the fact that
an innocent little boy who is its supposed beneficiary has long
since become its victim.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Cubans have managed to exceed even their past excesses
_ a daunting challenge. They have been matched and, though they
don't seem to get it, have been egged on by a game-playing Fidel
Castro who now has a no-lose deal. If Elian returns, Castro claims
credit. If the boy stays, Castro usefully demonizes the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle has brought a long line of supplicant politicians
to Miami to have their anti-Castro credentials updated by adding to
the hoopla. We now have Miami's mayor all but openly inviting mass
resistance to American law.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, we have a craven vice president.
</P>
<P>
   When there was a flap last year over teaching evolution or
creationism in Kansas, Gore _ a rare politician who actually
understands and cares about science _ said, in effect, either would
be fine.
</P>
<P>
   You know, a couple more times around this track and it ought to
look like home to Al Gore.

KATHLEEN TURNER BRINGS OUT NAKED TRUTH ABOUT LONDONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Wanna sell theater tickets?
</P>
<P>
   Get yer kit off!
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the lesson here in London's West End, the
Broadway of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the hottest play in the West End was ``The Blue
Room,'' David Hare's drama about sexual obsession, which received
enormous publicity, mostly for the fact that Nicole Kidman appeared
on stage naked. One critic famously described the Australian
actress's performance as ``theatrical Viagra.'' The play went on to
become a hit on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hottest ticket in town is for a stage adaptation of
``The Graduate,'' in which veteran Hollywood actress Kathleen
Turner plays the seductress Mrs. Robinson and, well, gets her kit
off, as the Brits say, playing the seduction scene in the nude.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales had been fair to middling when the show, which
opens Wednesday, went into previews last week. But once word got
around that Turner was taking to the floorboards at the Gielgud
Theatre wearing nothing but her talent, the show sold out its
three-month run in a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   This despite the fact that, at 45, Kathleen Turner ain't no
Nicole Kidman. In the film ``Body Heat,'' Turner turned in one of
the most erotic performances of 1980s mainstream Hollywood, using
her sex appeal to get William Hurt's character to kill her husband.
But Turner is no longer the slinky temptress she played in ``Body
Heat.''
</P>
<P>
   She is, however, an accomplished actress, and perhaps more
importantly, a shrewd judge of what puts bums in seats, as the
Brits say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people learned that Kathleen appears nude, people went
mad, and the tickets just disappeared,'' said Hayley Burke, a
spokeswoman for the theater, who said the show has set the record
for advance sales by a dramatic play in the West End.
</P>
<P>
   Burke dismissed suggestions that the nude scene had been
included for commercial reasons. She said it is artful and in
keeping with writer-director Terry Johnson's adaptation of Charles
Webb's original novel, in which the protagonist Benjamin Braddock
gets seduced by the wife of his father's boss. Dustin Hoffman and
Anne Bancroft played the odd couple in the Oscar-winning film.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the decision to do the nude scene ``was very much a
mutual one'' between Turner and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   When he recently snatched up a string of West End theaters,
Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer-impresario behind ``Phantom of
the Opera'' and other enormously successful shows, said one of his
motives was to save London's stages from the bottom line, mostly
American owners who would be so profit-driven that they would put
on only safe, commercially successful, ``dumbed down'' fare.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plays on display in the West End these days are far
from conservative, but whether they are dumb is a matter of
opinion. At the Young Vic, for example, you can take in a
performance of ``The Man With The Absurdly Large Penis.'' At the
Gate, the show ``Cuckoos'' centers on a couple who become stuck
together while having anal sex. A serious play that took its name
from a profane reference to Franz Kafka's penis just wrapped up a
long run.
</P>
<P>
   There is a temptation to exaggerate here, to suggest that the
stiff-upper-lip Brits go a little nutty whenever they see a body
part that is normally clothed, that titillation is being used to
sell theater tickets.
</P>
<P>
   But as Fiachra Gibbons, the arts correspondent for The Guardian,
put it, the real revelation in ``The Blue Room'' for most audiences
was that Kidman, previously known for her film work and marriage to
Tom Cruise, could carry her own on stage. Gibbons said audiences
didn't leave the theater praising her body, but her acting. Preview
audiences have given Turner standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons also said that the only real extended commercial and
critical sensation in the West End in recent years was ``The
Weir,'' by the Irish playwright Conor McPherson, in which three
wistful bachelors tell ghost stories in a pub in the west of
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons is right. The London theater crowd remains a discerning
bunch, more likely to see something by Shaw, Wilde, Stoppard,
Beckett and Pinter than they are to sit next to tourists at ``The
Lion King'' or ``Mamma Mia,'' the wildly successful show about Abba
songs. Contemporary British playwrights, such as Michael Frayn and
Alan Bennett, produce consistently provocative plays that are both
critical and commercial successes.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is this: Put a naked woman on display, on
page three of a sensational tabloid or even the stage of a
venerable theater, and many Brits will line up with cash in hand.
</P>
<P>
   It seems only a matter of time before there's a West End revival
of ``Oh, Calcutta.''

AUTHOR FINDS FAR NORTH A COLD, HOSPITABLE PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding; Kenn Harper is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Like the needle of a compass, Kenn Harper's yearnings
have always pointed due north. After graduating from teachers'
school in his native Ontario, he volunteered in 1966 for a school
posting in the Inuit, or Eskimo, hamlet of Broughton Island, in
Canada's eastern Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   But with 250 souls, including 12 other whites, the settlement
was simply too big and _ what with its Hudson's Bay Co. trading
store and Royal Canadian Mounted Police outpost _ just too
urbanized to satisfy Harper.
</P>
<P>
   So he moved with his wife and infant son to Padloping Island, an
entirely Inuit settlement, population 34. ``No church, no store, no
nothing but the one room I used for the school,'' Harper recalled.
``That was more like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for the marriage, it wasn't; his family fled a few months
later, stunned by the cold and isolation. But Harper was in
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Like most longtime northerners, Harper, now 55, has been a jack
of all trades: teacher, development officer, linguist, storeowner,
and compiler of a dictionary of Inuktitut, an Eskimo language. ``In
my heart, I'm a historian,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He married a Greenland Inuit, and it was during a 1977 visit to
the village of Qaanaaq that he first heard of Minik. ``My
mother-in-law, Amaunnalik, knew Minik as a child,'' he said. ``The
elders recalled him. But the tales they told seemed fantastic and
improbable.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper spent years in an obsessive quest for the story,
traveling as far as Copenhagen. ``My search ended in Pittsburg,
N.H., where Minik died,'' he said. ``Seeing Minik's final resting
place was a very emotional moment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of New York's American Museum of Natural History,
stung by Harper's account, have pleaded that the moral standards of
today should not be applied to yesterday's actions. But Harper is
unswayed: ``Staging a fake burial to fool a little boy was as wrong
100 years ago as it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper today is a businessman in Iqaluit, population 5000,
capital of the new Inuit territory of Nunavut and 180 miles below
the Arctic Circle. ``It's the biggest place I've lived in 34
years,'' he said. ``And certainly the most southerly.''

RECKONING A SHORT, SAD LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding; with sidebar, Canada-Harper; Kenn Harper is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ It was in the fall of 1897 that a 7-year-old Inuit
boy named Minik was delivered to New York's American Museum of
Natural History by the renowned Arctic adventurer Robert E. Peary.
The youngster was accompanied by five other ``live Eskimo
specimens,'' colorful in fur costume, who drew tens of thousands of
gawkers in a day when explorers were super-celebrities and scrutiny
of primitive societies all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, four of the Eskimos _ including Minik's father,
Qisuk _ were dead, felled by germs to which they possessed no
resistance. Another was put on a ship headed home to the far
northwestern fringe of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   That left the little boy with the solemn smile alone in the huge
metropolis. He would be poked, weighed, and measured by men of
science, ogled by the paying public, and doted on by society
ladies. But the first account of the short, sad life of New York's
Eskimo, written by a Canadian researcher and just released by a
small Vermont publishing house, describes how Minik also became the
victim of a staggeringly cruel ruse by one of the world's
preeminent museums _ a hoax brought to light when the youth, years
later, chanced upon the skeleton of his father in a museum exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Minik's anger at Peary, whom he threatened to shoot unless
Qisuk's body was returned, brought a flurry of lurid headlines at
the time. But when the Eskimo died in 1918 in New Hampshire, he had
been long forgotten _ except among his people in distant Greenland
_ and his father's bones remained part of the museum's immense
repository of artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Minik's story is told in a disturbing book that, like the Eskimo
boy himself, seemed destined for obscurity. ``Give Me My Father's
Body: The Life of Minik, The New York Eskimo'' was self-published
after its author, Kenn Harper, was unable to find a commercial
house willing to take on the tale that had become his obsession.
For 14 years he flogged copies over the counter of his general
store in Iqaluit, on Baffin Island in the Canadian far north.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could also buy it at a place in Nuuk, Greenland, and a
store in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories,'' said the 55-year-old
Ontario man, who has worked for 34 years as a teacher and
businessman in Eskimo settlements of Canada and Greenland. ``Not
exactly Barnes and Noble.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the first commercial edition of the book _ published by
Vermont's Steerforth Press, which paid roughly $175,000 for ``Give
Me My Father's Body'' after an intense bidding war _ is arriving in
bookstores across North America, to the museum's apparent
displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   The Book of the Month Club has selected the historical account
for its April list; Pocket Books won paperback rights; and Academy
Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey, who wrote the new foreword, has
secured the movie option.
</P>
<P>
   It is a startling success for a macabre tale of looted
skeletons, of freebooting rapacity by prominent figures of Arctic
exploration, and of the conquest of the polar north as seen through
the eyes of the Inuit, as many of today's Eskimos prefer to be
called.
</P>
<P>
   Most controversially, the book paints an unlovely portrait of
two American icons: the widely respected museum and Peary, who in
1909 led the first expedition to the North Pole. The explorer,
according to Harper's book, stole Eskimo corpses from Arctic
resting places, turning a healthy sum on the sale of remains to the
museum. Harper's book also documents Peary's removal of three
meteorites held sacred by Eskimos, and evidence that he peddled
other looted relics. Such skullduggery in the name of science was
commissioned, in part, by the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peary epitomized the greed and arrogance that was typical of
white explorers during the Golden Age of Arctic exploration,'' said
Harper from Iqaluit. ``Although he admired the northern survival
skills of the Eskimos, he had no affinity for them as a people, no
real respect for their culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Peary and other turn-of-the-century luminaries,
including esteemed anthropologist Franz Boas, appear little better
than high-minded grave robbers, pursuing knowledge with a lack of
cultural sensitivity that seems shocking from the vantage of modern
times.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the book occurs as many museums in the United
States, including the Museum of Natural History, are feeling heat
from aboriginal groups demanding the return of bones and other
relics taken by scientists. Hundreds of native skeletons are
believed to rest in dusty storage vaults or meticulously labeled
display drawers in scores of museums.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest part of Harper's book tells how the museum
deliberately tricked the then 8-year-old boy into thinking his
father, Qisuk, had received the burial demanded by Inuit custom.
``Incredible as it may seem,'' the author writes, ``the scientists
at the (museum) staged a phony funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre ruse, officials solemnly interred a log wrapped in
ceremonial cloth in the museum garden, then _ keeping with Inuit
ritual _ heaped the ``grave'' with stones as a weeping Minik
watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy never suspected,'' Harper quotes William Wallace, a
museum superintendent who adopted Minik. ``When the grave was
complete he made his mark on the north side of it. You see that is
the Eskimo way.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, Qisuk's body was the subject of a tug of war
between the museum and Bellevue Hospital's College of Physicians
and Surgeons, each wanting the honor of examining the exotic
corpse. In the end, the doctors dissected the body and pickled the
brain in a specimen jar; the museum won rights to the Eskimo's
bones _ stripping them, bleaching them in a vat usually used for
animal remains, and slathering them with lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   Minik, unaware of the desecration, was raised by Wallace's
family. He learned English, studied reptiles, played baseball _ and
lost all memory of his Inuktitut language. Then, in 1907, during a
visit to the museum, he made a devastating discovery: his father's
bones in a display case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw myself at the bottom of the glass case and prayed and
wept,'' he would later describe the moment. ``I went straight to
the director and implored him to let me bury my father. He would
not. I swore I would never rest until I had given my father
burial.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers trumpeted the scandal coast-to-coast. Minik railed
publicly against the man he held responsible: ``Peary's Neglected
Eskimo Boy Wants To Shoot Him,'' proclaimed a headline in the San
Francisco Examiner. The hoopla caused great embarrassment for
Peary, who was especially alarmed that the Eskimo would divulge
that the explorer, a married man, had fathered two children by
Inuit women during Arctic sojourns.
</P>
<P>
   Minik was hustled back to Greenland, but within a few years was
pining for the United States. ``He was a young man caught between
two worlds, yearning for the city lights as much as the northern
lights,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   So Minik returned to America, winding up in Pittsburg, N.H.,
where he worked as a lumberjack and made close friends. But his
newfound happiness was brief _ he died in the Spanish flu pandemic
in 1918, age 27 or 28. He lies beneath a simple headstone not far
from the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Natural History still adamantly denies any
wrongdoing, and for decades refused to relinquish native remains.
In 1993, however, following renewed controversy triggered by
Harper's book, the institution repatriated the skeletons of four
Eskimos, including Qisuk, to Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   They are buried in the Lutheran cemetery at Qaanaaq, beneath a
plaque inscribed in the Inuit language, ``They Have Come Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials, meanwhile, last month acknowledged that the
remains of seven other Inuit _ including a mother, father, and
little girl whose bones were disinterred by Peary _ remain part of
its vast collection.

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nobody wants to publicly admit it, but the Republican Party can
forget about reaping the benefits of the black vote in the first
presidential election of this new millennium.
 &HT;    Come November 2000, African-Americans _ regardless of social
class or region _ will probably vote for Vice President Al Gore in
overwhelming percentages.
 &HT;    Although blacks have appeared as incorrigible Democrats since
the second term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the current
crystallization of black attitudes has been decades in the making.
In the minds of a large majority of black voters, the image of
present-day Republican leadership has become near permanently
etched as ``the enemy.''
 &HT;    In the old days, the black man's true enemies were Southern
Democrats, and their Northern allies, who were willing to maintain
or tolerate Jim Crow at any cost. The Southern-based enemy was
adamantly opposed to any governmental interference that might
assure equal voting rights, equal access to education, fair
employment, fair housing or even protection from lynch mobs.
 &HT;    Back then, blacks considered the word ``enemy'' as synonymous
with ``Southern Democrat.''
 &HT;    Even when Northern politicians of good will occupied the White
House, the Senate, the House of Representatives or the U.S. Supreme
Court, their private sentiments were consistently nullified by a
deference to Southern Democrats. Consequently, the horrendous lynch
mob activity of the 1920s never resulted in the passage of an
anti-lynching bill.
 &HT;    Yet, since Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s and 1940s blacks
have made great strides under the administrations of Presidents
Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton _
all Southern Democrats.
 &HT;    Step by step, the GOP's counter southern strategy has wrought
success. It broke up the ``Solid South'' by giving conservative
Democrats a new identity. Meet the New Southern Republican, who can
now work shamelessly in open concert in right-wing crusades that
cross all regional boundaries.
 &HT;    The heart of this political dynamic is not confined to the
right-to-life crusades against abortion, or the end of big
government and the cessation of big taxes. Slap dab in the middle
is the right to contain _ if not stop _ any further concessions or
``giveaways'' to blacks.
 &HT;    Stopping affirmative action is central to the Republican appeal.
Even when it tries to soften that goal by displaying a few blacks
in upfront positions, the strategy is in motion.
 &HT;    Time after time, at crucial moments, the Republican strategy has
been to send a clear, not-so-subtle message to the white South,
which declares: ``We sympathize with you on the race issue.'' Here
is a chronology for that message, which could not be missed by any
knowledgeable black.
 &HT;    When Gov. Ronald Reagan, patron saint of Republicanism, launched
his southern crusade for the presidency, he chose little
Philadelphia, Miss., to kickoff his drive.
 &HT;    Philadelphia's only previous claim to fame was providing a site
for the 1964 murder of three youthful civil workers: James E.
Chaney, a black, Michael H. Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, both
white.
 &HT;    When Richard Nixon announced his presidential bid in the
Midwest, he chose Pontiac, Mich., which had gained recent notoriety
by the highly publicized burning of integration-bound schoolbuses.
 &HT;    Who tried to scare the daylights out of white folks with the
likes of imprisoned killer Willie Horton turned loose to roam your
streets? None other than strategists for Vice President George
Bush, a group that used race to catapult Bush into the White House.
 &HT;    When in this new millennium Gov. George W. Bush chose Bob Jone's
University to launch his South Carolina campaign for the
presidency, he was not breaking ground. He merely was following
suit. His willing presence at the university was a proclamation.
 &HT;    After the Bob Jones scenario, it was patently evident that Bush
would chose ``neutrality'' on the Confederate flag flying over
South Carolina's capitol dome, thereby offering fresh solace to
this homage to slavery and racism.
 &HT;    Bush and all GOP presidential candidates simply acted out the
New Republican Tradition on Race.
 &HT;    It is racially offensive to suggest that African-Americans do
not see or understand what is going on. Don't be misled by the few
cheerful black faces occasionally seen on the evening news nodding
agreement with Republican speakers.
 &HT;    I have never seen any candidate for the presidency, however
repugnant his advocacy, who could not find a black supporter. But
last week I welcomed one hint of resistance from within the GOP as
I watched CNN's television coverage of California's black
anti-affirmative action campaigner Ward Connerly in Dallas.
 &HT;    Answering a question from his near all-white audience, Connerly
conceded that Congress' lone black Republican, Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, disagreed with Connerly's campaign, calling it ill-timed.
 &HT;    So, let us give thanks for even microscopic concessions to
reality. However, the die is cast because the GOP has too many
promises to keep with former Democrats.

 By Stanley T. Lee  
 &HT;    They said it couldn't be done.
 &HT;    A small technology startup dared to challenge the giants of the
telecommunications industry. Two years later, Bitro Communications
pronounced ``bee-tro,'' has proved that it can compete with the
likes of AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint.
 &HT;    The founders of the company chose the name Bitro, which in
Korean means ``toward the light,'' to symbolize the team's mission
to elevate the company to the upper echelons of the telecom field.
But this is an industry dominated by corporate household names and
other Fortune 500 companies. The key to Bitro's success was the
relentless pursuit made by seven young entrepreneurs for a direct
connection contract with Korean Telecom, the dominant telecom
carrier in South Korea _ the equivalent to AT&AMP;T. Several emerging
telecom companies, such as Frontier, Global Crossing and Qwest,
failed in their attempts to establish a relationship with Korea
Telecom, as the company decided to partner only with the Big Three.
 &HT;    But because of their tenacity, Bitro joined AT&AMP;T, MCI and Sprint
in providing long-distance phone service to Korea through Korea
Telecom.
 &HT;    Bitro soon emerged as a leading carrier of voice and data to and
from Korea, surpassing MCI and Sprint. During December 1999, Bitro
handled nearly as much AT&AMP;T, according to Korea Telecom sources.
Now, Bitro is earning over $1 million a month in revenue, with
prospects for future growth. Bitro will expand by merging and
acquiring other companies with direct connections throughout Asia.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, this is a far different picture from when the
company first started in April 1998.
 &HT;    Bitro's founders, composed primarily of 1.5- and
second-generation Korean Americans, struggled in the early months
of operation. Several of them gave up their salaries in order to
preserve every penny of scarce capital. There were numerous
occasions when consecutive nights were spent in the office with
little regard to personal hygiene.
 &HT;    They familiarized themselves with the telecommunications
technology, spending countless hours reading manuals and complex
technical guides. When they called Lucent Technologies for
technical assistance on a switch that they just bought, the Bitro
engineers were the ones that figured out how to make it function
properly, not the Lucent technicians.
 &HT;    Designing and implementing advanced telecommunications systems
presented an enormous challenge, but with sweat and a lot of luck,
their resilience paid off.
 &HT;    When the first call to Korea was made over their system to the
mother of Chris Lee, Bitro's chief financial officer and founder,
tears fell from the eyes of all the founders. Lee commented that
his mother's voice never sounded sweeter.
 &HT;    Bitro will now promote the use of advanced technology to offer
traditional voice and data products at competitive prices. Bitro
CEO and President Tae Joon Kim envisions integrating the Internet
with traditional phone products and new value-added services. One
thing the Bitro pioneers never wanted was to position the company
as a traditional telecom company, let alone a typical Korean
company. But one of the keys to Bitro's success is that it operates
as an American corporation with a strong understanding and
appreciation for Korean culture.
 &HT;    ``We are Koreans, and we are an American company,'' says Patrick
Kim, vice president.
 &HT;    By capitalizing on its dual cultural and philosophical
identities, Bitro hopes to innovate the ways people communicate
globally in the new millennium.

 By PATRICIA GUADALUPE  
 &HT;    Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is the highest-ranking Hispanic
in the Clinton Administration.
 &HT;    A former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and New Mexico
congressman, he helped secure congressional approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
 &HT;    Lately, he's been using his international contacts to press for
lower oil prices worldwide.
 &HT;    Richardson also is helping with Hispanic outreach for the Gore
for President campaign, and his name has been bandied about as a
possible vice-presidential candidate on the Gore ticket.
 &HT;    Here, he talks about politics and other matters.
 &HT;    ----
 &HT;     Q:  Is the country ready for a Hispanic vice president?
 &HT;     A:  Yes, absolutely. The American public is ready to accept a
Hispanic candidate. I think it would not only be a pleasant
surprise, it would be right on target and make sense.
 &HT;    If it doesn't happen in this election, it'll happen in the next.
But I won't speculate that I will be the one. It's a presidential
candidate's call. I'm not campaigning for the job. I don't think I
would be the only one to be considered.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What are some of the things you are doing as part of the
Gore campaign's outreach efforts within the Hispanic community?
 &HT;     A:  We have a group of Hispanic leaders and legislators,
Ganamos con Gore, and we have been meeting to get a strong
organization going in support of the vice president. He has good
support in the Hispanic community, but Bush and McCain have a
greater impact on the Hispanic community than other Republican
candidates.
 &HT;    I think we are going to win, but what we don't want is for the
Republicans to get more than 30 percent of the vote. If that
happens, it could negatively affect our numbers in several states.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Are you worried about the Republican candidates' appeal in
the Hispanic community?
 &HT;     A:  Yes, because Bush and McCain have run in states with large
Hispanic populations. They've been successful in appealing to
Hispanics and they haven't acted like other Republican candidates
who have been totally negative toward the Latino community. It's a
challenge.
 &HT;    The main challenge is making sure that their percentage of the
Latino vote doesn't rise. (The GOP's all-time high of 40 percent of
the Hispanic vote occurred with President Reagan in 1984.)
 &HT;    If the Republican candidate gets 40 percent of the vote, for
instance, that would be a serious problem for the Democratic Party,
because it would be in key states for us, like California, Florida,
Texas, Illinois, New York.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  The meetings that you are involved in with Ganamos con Gore
_ how are you developing a strategy targeted to the Hispanic
community?
 &HT;     A:  We've been traveling all over the place _ New Hampshire,
Iowa, California, New York. There are many members of the group who
are working as volunteers in those and other states.
 &HT;    Part of our plan is to organize every state and to also do some
fund raising for the campaign. And I'm not just talking about
getting elected officials involved. We want to have a real
grassroots campaign, and we're working to appeal to the younger
generation in our community, with issues like the global economy
and technology.
 &HT;    We also are talking to the community about a whole range of
issues, not just about ``Latino issues'' like civil rights and
bilingual education. Those are important issues, but we also talk
about mainstream issues, like the federal budget, defense, Social
Security, the economy. It's very important to talk about mainstream
issues as well as the issues we always talk about.
 &HT;    The Hispanic community is not homogeneous and not concentrated
on the same issues. The community is interested in a whole range of
issues.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  The Clinton administration has an almost eight-year-old
record in the Hispanic community. So why do you think that some
polls show Bush with greater support over Gore in the Hispanic
community?
 &HT;     A:  The polls I've seen show Gore ahead of Bush. The important
thing is the margin of victory. Bush is going to be a challenge, as
would McCain. What is key is to not take the Hispanic vote for
granted. We have to be really aggressive as far as getting the
Hispanic vote is concerned.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How do you even find the time to do this, with all the work
as energy secretary at the same time?
 &HT;     A:  Of course I don't have all the time I would like. But I'm
not the only person involved in reaching out to the Latino
community for the vice president. I'm probably the main one, but of
course not the only one.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Speaking of your day job, you recently unveiled a
departmental initiative to increase the number of Hispanics working
in the science field.
 &HT;     A:  We have a program to try to increase the number of Hispanic
scientists. We are working with several universities that have a
significant Latino population, and with groups that work with
Hispanic students, such as the Hispanic Association of Colleges and
Universities, establishing internships and scholarship programs.

 By JAMES GARCIA 
 &HT;    Colombia is not another Vietnam. But didn't the United States
learn anything from that war?
 &HT;    The policy toward Vietnam was fueled by fear and ignorance. The
U.S. government was afraid that communists were about to take over
the world. In our ignorance _ and arrogance _ we thought that
carpet bombing the North Vietnamese would convince communists
everywhere that American-style democracy was a better alternative.
 &HT;    Today, the Clinton administration and Congress worry that drug
traffickers in Colombia are trying to take over certain parts of
the world. In their ignorance, Clinton and his supporters suggest
that new legislation to send the Colombian government about $1.7
billion to battle drug traffickers _ and the Marxist rebels that
protect them _ will discourage drug lords from smuggling dangerous
narcotics into the United States.
 &HT;    As with the United States' ill-conceived plans to thwart
Communism in Vietnam, the U.S. drug policy in Colombia will fail.
 &HT;    Colombia's civil war has dragged on for 40 years. To date, about
35,000 people _ mostly civilians _ have been killed in the
conflict, and the death toll continues to mount. Meanwhile, the
U.S. government's involvement in Colombia continues to deepen.
 &HT;    U.S. military advisors routinely provide special training to
Colombia's armed forces. The Drug Enforcement Administration is
involved in extensive investigations there.
 &HT;    American lives have even been lost. In fact, more American
soldiers have died in Colombia than in the war in Kosovo.
 &HT;    Last July, five U.S. soldiers were killed in Colombia when their
airplane slammed into the Andes Mountains during an anti-drug spy
mission. Their deaths, however, attracted little attention by the
U.S. media.
 &HT;    On March 20, Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, explained the U.S. military's mission in Colombia.
 &HT;    ``One of the threats to America's interest is the large amount
of drugs that come in from that region,'' Shelton said during a
press conference at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, where the
soldiers who died were once stationed. ``It is in America's
interest, I think, to do whatever we can to slow the amount of
drugs coming in.''
 &HT;    Colombia produces about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in
the United States. It is also a major producer of heroin and
marijuana. Last year, Colombian traffickers earned an estimated
$3.5 billion dealing drugs. During that same period, according the
National Association of Financial Institutions, Colombia earned
$3.7 billion producing oil, its leading export.
 &HT;    Shelton did not mention Colombia's rebel armies, which control
about 50 percent of the countryside. We're not officially at war
with them. But no one believes that Colombia's military _ slated to
receive about 75 percent of the $1.7 billion in U.S. aid _ will not
hesitate to use the U.S.-made Blackhawk helicopters it plans to
purchase against rebels if given half a chance.
 &HT;    And since the guerrillas are led by the 17,000-strong
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which is known to
protect the drug traffickers, there should be plenty of
opportunities.
 &HT;    FARC officials who are involved in peace negotiations with the
Colombian government say the U.S. aid package will only fuel the
war. If the Colombian military uses the added resources to mount a
major military offensive, the rebels vow to strike back hard.
 &HT;    We should also ask ourselves if the Colombian government even
deserves to receive any U.S. aid, especially in light of its record
of military abuses against civilians.
 &HT;    In late February, the U.S. State Department issued a stinging
report charging that in 1999 ``government forces continued to
commit numerous, serious abuses'' that included murders and
torture. The report also documented formal links between the army
and right-wing paramilitary death squads, which, like the rebels,
have profited from the international drug trade. ``Paramilitary
forces find a ready support base within the military and police,''
the State Department concluded.
 &HT;    For his part, Colombian President Andres Pastrana, like his
predecessors, pledged to crack down on human-rights abuses
committed by the government's armed forces. Like his predecessors,
hehas failed to live up to that promise.
 &HT;    In December, Pastrana vetoed a bill that would have created a
government agency to search for thousands of missing leftists and
made genocide an official crime. The United Nations has been urging
Colombia to approve the legislation for the past 12 years. Critics
say Pastrana bowed to pressure from the military, which claimed the
proposed legislation would hamper its efforts against the rebels.
 &HT;    In the end, any money and equipment given to the Colombian
military will be used to fight the rebels and the drug traffickers.
As a result, the war will widen and many more Colombians will die.
 &HT;    As for the drug traffickers, they will simply wait to ship their
goods another day.

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nobody wants to publicly admit it, but the Republican Party can
forget about reaping the benefits of the black vote in the first
presidential election of this new millennium.
 &HT;    Come November 2000, African-Americans _ regardless of social
class or region _ will probably vote for Vice President Al Gore in
overwhelming percentages.
 &HT;    Although blacks have appeared as incorrigible Democrats since
the second term of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the current
crystallization of black attitudes has been decades in the making.
In the minds of a large majority of black voters, the image of
present-day Republican leadership has become near permanently
etched as ``the enemy.''
 &HT;    In the old days, the black man's true enemies were Southern
Democrats, and their Northern allies, who were willing to maintain
or tolerate Jim Crow at any cost. The Southern-based enemy was
adamantly opposed to any governmental interference that might
assure equal voting rights, equal access to education, fair
employment, fair housing or even protection from lynch mobs.
 &HT;    Back then, blacks considered the word ``enemy'' as synonymous
with ``Southern Democrat.''
 &HT;    Even when Northern politicians of good will occupied the White
House, the Senate, the House of Representatives or the U.S. Supreme
Court, their private sentiments were consistently nullified by a
deference to Southern Democrats. Consequently, the horrendous lynch
mob activity of the 1920s never resulted in the passage of an
anti-lynching bill.
 &HT;    Yet, since Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s and 1940s blacks
have made great strides under the administrations of Presidents
Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton _
all Southern Democrats.
 &HT;    Step by step, the GOP's counter southern strategy has wrought
success. It broke up the ``Solid South'' by giving conservative
Democrats a new identity. Meet the New Southern Republican, who can
now work shamelessly in open concert in right-wing crusades that
cross all regional boundaries.
 &HT;    The heart of this political dynamic is not confined to the
right-to-life crusades against abortion, or the end of big
government and the cessation of big taxes. Slap dab in the middle
is the right to contain _ if not stop _ any further concessions or
``giveaways'' to blacks.
 &HT;    Stopping affirmative action is central to the Republican appeal.
Even when it tries to soften that goal by displaying a few blacks
in upfront positions, the strategy is in motion.
 &HT;    Time after time, at crucial moments, the Republican strategy has
been to send a clear, not-so-subtle message to the white South,
which declares: ``We sympathize with you on the race issue.'' Here
is a chronology for that message, which could not be missed by any
knowledgeable black.
 &HT;    When Gov. Ronald Reagan, patron saint of Republicanism, launched
his southern crusade for the presidency, he chose little
Philadelphia, Miss., to kickoff his drive.
 &HT;    Philadelphia's only previous claim to fame was providing a site
for the 1964 murder of three youthful civil workers: James E.
Chaney, a black, Michael H. Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, both
white.
 &HT;    When Richard Nixon announced his presidential bid in the
Midwest, he chose Pontiac, Mich., which had gained recent notoriety
by the highly publicized burning of integration-bound schoolbuses.
 &HT;    Who tried to scare the daylights out of white folks with the
likes of imprisoned killer Willie Horton turned loose to roam your
streets? None other than strategists for Vice President George
Bush, a group that used race to catapult Bush into the White House.
 &HT;    When in this new millennium Gov. George W. Bush chose Bob Jone's
University to launch his South Carolina campaign for the
presidency, he was not breaking ground. He merely was following
suit. His willing presence at the university was a proclamation.
 &HT;    After the Bob Jones scenario, it was patently evident that Bush
would chose ``neutrality'' on the Confederate flag flying over
South Carolina's capitol dome, thereby offering fresh solace to
this homage to slavery and racism.
 &HT;    Bush and all GOP presidential candidates simply acted out the
New Republican Tradition on Race.
 &HT;    It is racially offensive to suggest that African-Americans do
not see or understand what is going on. Don't be misled by the few
cheerful black faces occasionally seen on the evening news nodding
agreement with Republican speakers.
 &HT;    I have never seen any candidate for the presidency, however
repugnant his advocacy, who could not find a black supporter. But
last week I welcomed one hint of resistance from within the GOP as
I watched CNN's television coverage of California's black
anti-affirmative action campaigner Ward Connerly in Dallas.
 &HT;    Answering a question from his near all-white audience, Connerly
conceded that Congress' lone black Republican, Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, disagreed with Connerly's campaign, calling it ill-timed.
 &HT;    So, let us give thanks for even microscopic concessions to
reality. However, the die is cast because the GOP has too many
promises to keep with former Democrats.

 By Stanley T. Lee  
 &HT;    They said it couldn't be done.
 &HT;    A small technology startup dared to challenge the giants of the
telecommunications industry. Two years later, Bitro Communications
pronounced ``bee-tro,'' has proved that it can compete with the
likes of AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint.
 &HT;    The founders of the company chose the name Bitro, which in
Korean means ``toward the light,'' to symbolize the team's mission
to elevate the company to the upper echelons of the telecom field.
But this is an industry dominated by corporate household names and
other Fortune 500 companies. The key to Bitro's success was the
relentless pursuit made by seven young entrepreneurs for a direct
connection contract with Korean Telecom, the dominant telecom
carrier in South Korea _ the equivalent to AT&AMP;T. Several emerging
telecom companies, such as Frontier, Global Crossing and Qwest,
failed in their attempts to establish a relationship with Korea
Telecom, as the company decided to partner only with the Big Three.
 &HT;    But because of their tenacity, Bitro joined AT&AMP;T, MCI and Sprint
in providing long-distance phone service to Korea through Korea
Telecom.
 &HT;    Bitro soon emerged as a leading carrier of voice and data to and
from Korea, surpassing MCI and Sprint. During December 1999, Bitro
handled nearly as much AT&AMP;T, according to Korea Telecom sources.
Now, Bitro is earning over $1 million a month in revenue, with
prospects for future growth. Bitro will expand by merging and
acquiring other companies with direct connections throughout Asia.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, this is a far different picture from when the
company first started in April 1998.
 &HT;    Bitro's founders, composed primarily of 1.5- and
second-generation Korean Americans, struggled in the early months
of operation. Several of them gave up their salaries in order to
preserve every penny of scarce capital. There were numerous
occasions when consecutive nights were spent in the office with
little regard to personal hygiene.
 &HT;    They familiarized themselves with the telecommunications
technology, spending countless hours reading manuals and complex
technical guides. When they called Lucent Technologies for
technical assistance on a switch that they just bought, the Bitro
engineers were the ones that figured out how to make it function
properly, not the Lucent technicians.
 &HT;    Designing and implementing advanced telecommunications systems
presented an enormous challenge, but with sweat and a lot of luck,
their resilience paid off.
 &HT;    When the first call to Korea was made over their system to the
mother of Chris Lee, Bitro's chief financial officer and founder,
tears fell from the eyes of all the founders. Lee commented that
his mother's voice never sounded sweeter.
 &HT;    Bitro will now promote the use of advanced technology to offer
traditional voice and data products at competitive prices. Bitro
CEO and President Tae Joon Kim envisions integrating the Internet
with traditional phone products and new value-added services. One
thing the Bitro pioneers never wanted was to position the company
as a traditional telecom company, let alone a typical Korean
company. But one of the keys to Bitro's success is that it operates
as an American corporation with a strong understanding and
appreciation for Korean culture.
 &HT;    ``We are Koreans, and we are an American company,'' says Patrick
Kim, vice president.
 &HT;    By capitalizing on its dual cultural and philosophical
identities, Bitro hopes to innovate the ways people communicate
globally in the new millennium.

 By PATRICIA GUADALUPE  
 &HT;    Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is the highest-ranking Hispanic
in the Clinton Administration.
 &HT;    A former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and New Mexico
congressman, he helped secure congressional approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
 &HT;    Lately, he's been using his international contacts to press for
lower oil prices worldwide.
 &HT;    Richardson also is helping with Hispanic outreach for the Gore
for President campaign, and his name has been bandied about as a
possible vice-presidential candidate on the Gore ticket.
 &HT;    Here, he talks about politics and other matters.
 &HT;    ----
 &HT;     Q:  Is the country ready for a Hispanic vice president?
 &HT;     A:  Yes, absolutely. The American public is ready to accept a
Hispanic candidate. I think it would not only be a pleasant
surprise, it would be right on target and make sense.
 &HT;    If it doesn't happen in this election, it'll happen in the next.
But I won't speculate that I will be the one. It's a presidential
candidate's call. I'm not campaigning for the job. I don't think I
would be the only one to be considered.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What are some of the things you are doing as part of the
Gore campaign's outreach efforts within the Hispanic community?
 &HT;     A:  We have a group of Hispanic leaders and legislators,
Ganamos con Gore, and we have been meeting to get a strong
organization going in support of the vice president. He has good
support in the Hispanic community, but Bush and McCain have a
greater impact on the Hispanic community than other Republican
candidates.
 &HT;    I think we are going to win, but what we don't want is for the
Republicans to get more than 30 percent of the vote. If that
happens, it could negatively affect our numbers in several states.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Are you worried about the Republican candidates' appeal in
the Hispanic community?
 &HT;     A:  Yes, because Bush and McCain have run in states with large
Hispanic populations. They've been successful in appealing to
Hispanics and they haven't acted like other Republican candidates
who have been totally negative toward the Latino community. It's a
challenge.
 &HT;    The main challenge is making sure that their percentage of the
Latino vote doesn't rise. (The GOP's all-time high of 40 percent of
the Hispanic vote occurred with President Reagan in 1984.)
 &HT;    If the Republican candidate gets 40 percent of the vote, for
instance, that would be a serious problem for the Democratic Party,
because it would be in key states for us, like California, Florida,
Texas, Illinois, New York.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  The meetings that you are involved in with Ganamos con Gore
_ how are you developing a strategy targeted to the Hispanic
community?
 &HT;     A:  We've been traveling all over the place _ New Hampshire,
Iowa, California, New York. There are many members of the group who
are working as volunteers in those and other states.
 &HT;    Part of our plan is to organize every state and to also do some
fund raising for the campaign. And I'm not just talking about
getting elected officials involved. We want to have a real
grassroots campaign, and we're working to appeal to the younger
generation in our community, with issues like the global economy
and technology.
 &HT;    We also are talking to the community about a whole range of
issues, not just about ``Latino issues'' like civil rights and
bilingual education. Those are important issues, but we also talk
about mainstream issues, like the federal budget, defense, Social
Security, the economy. It's very important to talk about mainstream
issues as well as the issues we always talk about.
 &HT;    The Hispanic community is not homogeneous and not concentrated
on the same issues. The community is interested in a whole range of
issues.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  The Clinton administration has an almost eight-year-old
record in the Hispanic community. So why do you think that some
polls show Bush with greater support over Gore in the Hispanic
community?
 &HT;     A:  The polls I've seen show Gore ahead of Bush. The important
thing is the margin of victory. Bush is going to be a challenge, as
would McCain. What is key is to not take the Hispanic vote for
granted. We have to be really aggressive as far as getting the
Hispanic vote is concerned.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How do you even find the time to do this, with all the work
as energy secretary at the same time?
 &HT;     A:  Of course I don't have all the time I would like. But I'm
not the only person involved in reaching out to the Latino
community for the vice president. I'm probably the main one, but of
course not the only one.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Speaking of your day job, you recently unveiled a
departmental initiative to increase the number of Hispanics working
in the science field.
 &HT;     A:  We have a program to try to increase the number of Hispanic
scientists. We are working with several universities that have a
significant Latino population, and with groups that work with
Hispanic students, such as the Hispanic Association of Colleges and
Universities, establishing internships and scholarship programs.

 By JAMES GARCIA 
 &HT;    Colombia is not another Vietnam. But didn't the United States
learn anything from that war?
 &HT;    The policy toward Vietnam was fueled by fear and ignorance. The
U.S. government was afraid that communists were about to take over
the world. In our ignorance _ and arrogance _ we thought that
carpet bombing the North Vietnamese would convince communists
everywhere that American-style democracy was a better alternative.
 &HT;    Today, the Clinton administration and Congress worry that drug
traffickers in Colombia are trying to take over certain parts of
the world. In their ignorance, Clinton and his supporters suggest
that new legislation to send the Colombian government about $1.7
billion to battle drug traffickers _ and the Marxist rebels that
protect them _ will discourage drug lords from smuggling dangerous
narcotics into the United States.
 &HT;    As with the United States' ill-conceived plans to thwart
Communism in Vietnam, the U.S. drug policy in Colombia will fail.
 &HT;    Colombia's civil war has dragged on for 40 years. To date, about
35,000 people _ mostly civilians _ have been killed in the
conflict, and the death toll continues to mount. Meanwhile, the
U.S. government's involvement in Colombia continues to deepen.
 &HT;    U.S. military advisors routinely provide special training to
Colombia's armed forces. The Drug Enforcement Administration is
involved in extensive investigations there.
 &HT;    American lives have even been lost. In fact, more American
soldiers have died in Colombia than in the war in Kosovo.
 &HT;    Last July, five U.S. soldiers were killed in Colombia when their
airplane slammed into the Andes Mountains during an anti-drug spy
mission. Their deaths, however, attracted little attention by the
U.S. media.
 &HT;    On March 20, Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, explained the U.S. military's mission in Colombia.
 &HT;    ``One of the threats to America's interest is the large amount
of drugs that come in from that region,'' Shelton said during a
press conference at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, where the
soldiers who died were once stationed. ``It is in America's
interest, I think, to do whatever we can to slow the amount of
drugs coming in.''
 &HT;    Colombia produces about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in
the United States. It is also a major producer of heroin and
marijuana. Last year, Colombian traffickers earned an estimated
$3.5 billion dealing drugs. During that same period, according the
National Association of Financial Institutions, Colombia earned
$3.7 billion producing oil, its leading export.
 &HT;    Shelton did not mention Colombia's rebel armies, which control
about 50 percent of the countryside. We're not officially at war
with them. But no one believes that Colombia's military _ slated to
receive about 75 percent of the $1.7 billion in U.S. aid _ will not
hesitate to use the U.S.-made Blackhawk helicopters it plans to
purchase against rebels if given half a chance.
 &HT;    And since the guerrillas are led by the 17,000-strong
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which is known to
protect the drug traffickers, there should be plenty of
opportunities.
 &HT;    FARC officials who are involved in peace negotiations with the
Colombian government say the U.S. aid package will only fuel the
war. If the Colombian military uses the added resources to mount a
major military offensive, the rebels vow to strike back hard.
 &HT;    We should also ask ourselves if the Colombian government even
deserves to receive any U.S. aid, especially in light of its record
of military abuses against civilians.
 &HT;    In late February, the U.S. State Department issued a stinging
report charging that in 1999 ``government forces continued to
commit numerous, serious abuses'' that included murders and
torture. The report also documented formal links between the army
and right-wing paramilitary death squads, which, like the rebels,
have profited from the international drug trade. ``Paramilitary
forces find a ready support base within the military and police,''
the State Department concluded.
 &HT;    For his part, Colombian President Andres Pastrana, like his
predecessors, pledged to crack down on human-rights abuses
committed by the government's armed forces. Like his predecessors,
hehas failed to live up to that promise.
 &HT;    In December, Pastrana vetoed a bill that would have created a
government agency to search for thousands of missing leftists and
made genocide an official crime. The United Nations has been urging
Colombia to approve the legislation for the past 12 years. Critics
say Pastrana bowed to pressure from the military, which claimed the
proposed legislation would hamper its efforts against the rebels.
 &HT;    In the end, any money and equipment given to the Colombian
military will be used to fight the rebels and the drug traffickers.
As a result, the war will widen and many more Colombians will die.
 &HT;    As for the drug traffickers, they will simply wait to ship their
goods another day.

   ``After playing at classmates' homes, my 5-year-old son, Bobby,
greets me with questions like, 'Why can't I have as many cool toys
as my friends?' says Kay Johnson. ``I made a choice to stay home
with my kids while they're little but I'm feeling a lot of pressure
to keep up with families where both parents work.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says that she and her husband want Bobby ``to realize
that he just can't get everything he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't say you can't afford something if you can because your
kids will look back later and realize it wasn't true,'' cautions
psychologist Sylvia Rimm. ``Say, 'It costs too much and is not
within our value system.' Be firm, but don't deny them
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions such as, ``Why can't I have as many toys as my
friends?'' can be a good springboard for discussing financial
trade-offs. Whether you earn $40,000 or $400,000 a year (or get a
$4 weekly allowance), you have only a finite amount of money and
each person or family must decide what are the best things to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Children as young as 3 develop an interest in money, so talking
about it should begin before your child is unduly influenced by
product advertisements. Don't wait until your child starts school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching kids about money is part of the required curriculum
in only a small percentage of schools,'' says Don Blandin,
president of the American Savings Education Council, a nonprofit
association. Even if your child's school does have saving and
spending lessons, they need to be reinforced at home to have
lasting effect.
</P>
<P>
   A weekly allowance is a practical way to start teaching a child
as young as 5 or 6 how to manage money. The sums are small and
mistakes aren't fatal. By teaching these lessons before your
children head off to college and start getting credit cards, you
may be able to spare them an increasingly common college-student
problem: not having enough money to pay credit card bills and to
buy food.
</P>
<P>
   While a recent allowance survey showed that some teens are
getting $50 or more per week, many parents still give their kids
between 50 cents and a dollar per week per year of age. So an
8-year old would get $4 to $8 weekly. If, however, you expect your
children to pay for school clothes and athletic equipment they will
need more than if you're just providing a little spending money.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Baskin recalls starting her two daughters on allowances
``only after they begged, saying all their friends were getting
them. Chelsea, 11, gets $5 a week and Vanessa, 8, gets $3. I chose
those amounts after talking to other parents about going rates and
what they expected their kids to pay for. My kids' allowances are
not tied to chores.''
</P>
<P>
   Tying allowances to chores often backfires. Sooner or later many
kids will say, ``For that amount of money, I'm not doing those
chores.'' A good compromise for many families is a base allowance,
plus extra pay for additional chores (such as painting the lawn
furniture or cleaning the garage).
</P>
<P>
   Be realistic about the quality of your child's work. An
8-year-old won't paint the furniture as deftly as a professional,
but you're probably paying your child much less than you would a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea is lobbying for a raise to $7 a week. But this larger
sum will come with strings, including saving some of the money,
giving some to charity and even chipping in money to help pay for
friends' birthday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of kids, Chelsea admits, ``I don't have a good idea
of what things cost.'' Before settling on a new amount, she and her
mom have agreed to write a budget and go to a store to check
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Kids who learn the most about money typically have some
restrictions on when and how they can use their allowance. A
portion can be spent immediately, another portion must be saved and
a third portion is to be used to help others via charities or
individuals your family knows who need assistance. Piggy banks can
be inexpensive and as simple as labeling three plastic jars:
``spending money,'' ``saving money'' and ``charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Agree up front about other restrictions on the use of the money.
For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _ Can your child buy anything or are certain toys or other items
not permitted in the house?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is there a maximum amount (or percentage) of saved money that
your child can spend at one time?
</P>
<P>
   _ Can your child use the allowance to upgrade gifts you pay for
(a pricier catcher's mitt or trendier workout clothes)?
</P>
<P>
   Paying an allowance on time is a vital part of teaching a child
how to budget. ``I'm supposed to get paid on Saturdays, but
sometimes they forget and I forget to ask,'' says Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   To stay on schedule, at the beginning of the year, consider
giving each child a notebook or calendar containing 52 IOUs, one
for each week. Then pick a day to give each child their allowance
in exchange for one IOU.
</P>
<P>
   Saving was part of my kindergarten curriculum. As a 5-year-old,
I remember carrying two quarters to school twice a month. My public
school had arranged with a local bank to set up small, free savings
accounts for its students. A bank representative would drop by the
school to collect the money and give each of us a handwritten
deposit slip. Every few months, my mom would drive me to the bank
and we would get the deposits and interest posted to my passbook.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from making saving almost automatic, it was a shrewd
marketing move on the bank's part since consumers develop loyalty
to their first bank. Sadly, with large minimum deposit requirements
and hefty monthly fees, few banks offer free accounts to young
children anymore, but it doesn't hurt to ask.
</P>
<P>
   You can encourage saving with a Family 401(k), by matching money
your child doesn't spend. Whether you match dollar for dollar or 50
cents for every dollar, it's a simple way to show your child how
savings grow and it's easier to understand than compound interest.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS GET THE MONEY MESSAGE YOUNG
</P>
<P>
   Whether children learn to spend and save responsibly will
depend, in part, on the values conveyed to them by their parents.
And kids can begin to get that message when they're quite young.
</P>
<P>
   ``When parents don't have time to spend with their children,
they try to compensate with gifts,'' says psychologist Sylvia Rimm.
``Kids can get so much that they don't value anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a working mom, I always felt guilty. My hours were long, so
to try to make up for the time I wasn't spending with my then
3-year-old daughter, Catlin, I would bring her a gift _ a book or
toy _ every day,'' recalls J.C. Patrick. ``When she'd hear me at
the door, she'd run to meet me. But before saying hello, she would
ask, 'What did you bring me?'''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Catlin turned 4, Patrick knew these ``guilt gifts''
were getting out of hand. She discussed her dilemma with friends
and discovered that they, too, were having guilt pangs about
working long hours and were also overindulging their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a friend said, 'Your daughter would much rather have time
with you than a toy.' So I made a conscious effort to carve out
more time with her. It's amazing what you can learn when you sit
quietly and let your child talk about her day and what's important
to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, breaking the gift-giving ritual was tough. Patrick
recalls a trip to a store when Catlin wanted to buy a toy not on
their list. ``I said 'No,' a word she hadn't heard often, so she
followed me around the store saying loudly, 'I hope you know I'm
bringing this home.' I picked her up and we walked out the door
empty-handed.''
</P>
<P>
   The parent-child tug of war over toys and other must-have
possessions is not limited to homes where parents have demanding
jobs. Stay-at-home parents are also fighting a tougher battle than
June or Ward Cleaver ever did, and it's starting at a younger age.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Patrick knows first-hand that saving money doesn't always
come naturally: ``When I was young, I racked up credit card debt
that took me years to pay off and I don't want Catlin to fall into
the same trap. I'm trying to teach her that we can have as much fun
window-shopping as we can buying things.''

   Shortbread is one of the simplest and most versatile of cookie
doughs. Like its precursor, short cakes, which appeared in the
British Isles in the 16th century, it's made from butter, flour and
sugar. These simple ingredients produce a rich, crumbly cookie open
to endless variations. The dough rolls out easily and holds its
shape well, making it a prime candidate for little hands using
cookie cutters. Shortbread's buttery flavor makes it an adaptable
foil for other ingredients _ chopped nuts, chocolate chunks, citrus
rind, candied ginger, even peanut butter. This dough also does well
when used for jelly-filled sandwich cookies, crisp little jam
turnovers, lemon bars and pecan squares. And you can always
``chocolatize'' shortbread by adding cocoa powder.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever extra ingredients you use, the predominant flavor of
shortbread comes from the butter, so it's worth buying the best
butter available. Using unsalted butter permits the sweetness of
the butter to come through while allowing you to control the amount
of salt in the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on oven temperature, cookies can take on a golden glow
or the classic ivory hue. Since all cookies, including shortbread,
will continue to bake as they cool, remove them from the oven a
minute or two before they appear completely done. Cookies that you
want to be crisp yet tender, for example, should be removed from
the oven when they feel firm but still give a little to the touch.
Once cooled, they will be light, crisp and crumbly. On the other
hand, if permitted to completely set while baking, the cookies will
turn out too hard. And always place baking sheets on wire racks so
air circulates around the cookies as they cool.
</P>
<P>
   Making shortbread dough takes only a few minutes and, with the
help of a standing mixer, is effortless. The fun comes when you
realize that every batch of this simple dough can be different _
just add a favorite flavoring, shape with a whimsical cookie
cutter, or decorate with a colorful icing. So indulge yourself and
your family by baking a batch of cookies _ whether to celebrate
spring or to while away a pleasant afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE SHORTBREAD COOKIES (The Basic Recipe)
</P>
<P>
   This basic cookie dough lends itself to nearly endless
variations and possibilities. Vanilla and salt are optional, but
heighten the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 cups unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla extract (optional)
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl with mixer on
medium speed, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy. If
desired, add vanilla and beat until combined. Reduce mixer speed to
low; gradually beat in flour and salt, if using, until a dough
forms.
</P>
<P>
   2. Between two sheets of floured parchment paper, roll out half
of dough to a 1/8th inch thickness. Remove the top sheet of paper
and cut out as many shapes as possible, leaving 1/4 inch space in
between. Press together trimmings. Roll out dough again and cut
more shapes. Repeat with remaining half of dough.
</P>
<P>
   3. Bake until cookies are golden and feel slightly firm to the
touch _ 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool
completely. Store in an airtight container for up to four days or
freeze for up to two weeks. Makes 4 dozen 3 1/2 inch cookies.
</P>
<P>
   FIVE DELICIOUS TAKES ON OUR SIMPLE SHORTBREAD RECIPE
</P>
<P>
   Our recipe for ``Simple Shortbread Cookies'' yields cookies that
are rich, buttery and crisp. Enjoy them just as they are or try
these tasty variations on the basic dough.
</P>
<P>
   _ CLASSIC SHORTBREAD COOKIES: Divide the dough in half. Roll out
each half to a 12-inch round. Using a fluted pastry wheel, trim
perimeter and then cut each round into 16 pie-shaped slices.
Transfer the slices to a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake at
250oF until just firm to the touch _ 45 to 60 minutes. Makes around
32 cookies.
</P>
<P>
   _ GOLDEN SHORTBREAD COOKIES: Make dough as directed. Form 1-inch
balls and place on baking sheet, spaced 1 inch apart. Bake at 350oF
until golden brown _ 10 to 12 minutes. Makes around 5 dozen
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   _ CHOCOLATE SHORTBREAD COOKIES: When making dough, replace 1 cup
all-purpose flour with 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder. Form 1-inch
balls; place on baking sheet, spaced 1 inch apart. Bake at 350oF
until just firm to the touch _ 10 to 12 minutes. Makes around 5
dozen cookies.
</P>
<P>
   _ RASPBERRY THUMBPRINT COOKIES: Divide the dough into 3/4-inch
balls and place on parchment-lined baking sheets, spaced 1 inch
apart. Flatten each ball slightly with your thumb, making an
indentation in the center of each ball. Spoon a scant 1/4 teaspoon
of seedless raspberry jam into center of each cookie. Bake at 350oF
until cookies are set but not hard and the jam bubbles _ 12 to 15
minutes. Makes around 7 dozen cookies.
</P>
<P>
   _ EXTRAS: Add 1 1/2 to 2 cups chocolate chips, chopped nuts,
minced candied ginger, peanut-butter chips, shredded coconut, or
any combination of these to the dough for additional flavor and
texture.
</P>
<P>
   EASTER BUNNY SHORTBREAD SANDWICHES
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients for these decorative cookies are the basic
shortbread dough, 1 1/2 cups of seedless raspberry jam and 2/3 cup
of confectioners' sugar.
</P>
<P>
   First, heat the oven to 350oF. Between two sheets of floured
parchment paper, roll out half of the dough to a 1/8th inch
thickness. Place on a baking sheet and refrigerate for one hour.
Next, remove the top sheet of paper and cut out as many bunny
shapes as possible, leaving 1/4 inch space in between. Press
together the trimmings and roll out the dough again. Cut more
shapes. (If the dough becomes difficult to handle, chill in the
refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes.) Then, using a drinking straw,
make holes for the eyes in half of the shapes. Bake until the
cookies are golden and feel lightly firm to the touch _ 7 to 9
minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Finally, cover
the cookies without eyes with an even layer of jam, stopping just
short of the edges. Place the remaining shapes on paper towels;
sift an even layer of confectioners' sugar over tops. Place sugared
cookies on top of jam-covered ones. Add small dollops of jam, if
needed, to fill in the eyes. Store the sandwiches in an airtight
container for up to two days.
</P>
<P>
   BABY CHICK SHORTBREAD COOKIES:
</P>
<P>
   If you wish to use these cookies for decorative purposes only,
substitute 6 large egg whites combined with 6 cups confectioners'
sugar for the meringue powder and water. You'll need two plastic
squeeze bottles and a small pastry bag to decorate the cookies.
Meringue powder and Lemon-Yellow Liqua-Gel No. 11186, which we used
to decorate the cookies, are available from the New York Cake and
Baking Distributor, 56 West 22nd St., New York, NY 10010; Phone:
800-942-2539.
</P>
<P>
   Make the Simple Shortbread Cookie dough, refrigerate it, roll it
out, cut it and bake it as you would for the Easter Bunny
Shortbread Sandwiches. To make the icing, use:
</P>
<P>
   2 1 pound boxes plus 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons meringue power
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup warm water
</P>
<P>
   yellow liquid food coloring
</P>
<P>
   4 dozen mini chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   First, in a large bowl with mixer on low speed, beat two boxes
of confectioners' sugar, meringue powder and cream of tartar until
well mixed. Add water and increase speed to medium. Beat until
consistency is just smooth and pourable _ around two minutes. Cover
tightly with plastic wrap until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   Next, divide the icing among three bowls. Add 4 to 6 drops of
yellow food coloring to each of two bowls, stirring until well
mixed. Spoon the white icing into one squeeze bottle and one bowl
of yellow icing into another.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the remaining 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon
at a time, to the second bowl of yellow icing until consistency is
stiff enough to be used for piping; spoon this icing into a small
pastry bag fitted with a No. 6 tip. Using the pastry bag, pipe
yellow icing around a cookie and along the ``cracked'' edge. Repeat
with the remaining cookies. Using the squeeze bottle with the
yellow icing, fill in the ``chick'' parts. Fill in the ``egg''
parts with the white icing. Place a mini chocolate chip on each
cookie for an eye. Allow the icing to dry completely. Store in an
airtight container for up to four days. Makes 4 dozen chicks.

<P>
   Ever wonder why April 1 is called ``April Fool's Day?'' It's
because the annual calendar used in Europe used to begin with the
month of April. But in 1562, Pope Gregory introduced a new calendar
that ran from January 1 through December 31. News traveled slowly
in those days, however, and many people couldn't read. They refused
to believe that the calendar had changed; they continued to
celebrate April 1 as New Year's Day. Some of those who knew better
mocked them as ``April Fools.''
</P>
<P>
   As time went by and the new calendar became widely accepted, the
reason for April 1 being known as April Fool's Day was largely
forgotten, but the custom continued of playing practical jokes on
others. More benignly, this became a day for telling jokes.
</P>
<P>
   April Fool's Day has come and gone for another year, but it's
still the month of April and humor is always welcome. As American
humorist, Mark Twain, once remarked: ``The first of April is the
day we remember what we are the other 364 days of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quiz that may amuse you.
</P>
<P>
   1. ``I have a 'call' to literature, of a low order _ i.e.
humorous. It is nothing to be proud of, but it is my strongest suit
... seriously scribbling to excite the laughter of God's
creatures.'' So said:
</P>
<P>
   a) Oliver Wendell Holmes
</P>
<P>
   b) H.L. Mencken
</P>
<P>
   c) Mark Twain
</P>
<P>
   2. This fabled encounter between two witty ladies took place
when they arrived simultaneously at the entrance to a New York
restaurant. ``Age before beauty,'' Clare Booth Luce is reputed to
have said as she deferred to her rival. The rival swept through the
open door declaring, ``Pearls before swine.'' Who was the second
lady?
</P>
<P>
   a) Tallulah Bankhead
</P>
<P>
   b) Lillian Hellman
</P>
<P>
   c) Dorothy Parker
</P>
<P>
   3. This noted American could make people laugh in many ways,
including the theater. When he was told that a play of his was an
even bigger success in Paris in a French version than it had been

<P>
   a) Phillip Barry
</P>
<P>
   b) Marc Connelly
</P>
<P>
   c) James Thurber
</P>
<P>
   4. He was a versatile musician, a clever writer and a good
character actor _ indeed he was a ``character.'' One of his popular
songs is ``Blame It On My Youth.'' One of his volumes of

a virgin.'' His name?

<P>
   a) Steve Allen
</P>
<P>
   b) Oscar Levant
</P>
<P>
   c) Harpo Marx
</P>
<P>
   5. An enduring comic classic is the ``Lives and times of archy
and mehitabel,'' the work of Don Marquis. Mehitabel is a
sophisticated alley cat and archy is a literary:
</P>
<P>
   a) cockroach
</P>
<P>
   b) bulldog
</P>
<P>
   c) spider
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   c) Mark Twain
</P>

the paragraphs.'' So said:
</P>
<P>
   a) Russell Baker
</P>
<P>
   b) Art Buchwald
</P>
<P>
   c) James Thurber
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Give a man a free hand and he'll run it all over you.'' So
said:
</P>
<P>
   a) Anita Loos
</P>
<P>
   b) Dorothy Parker
</P>
<P>
   c) Mae West
</P>
<P>
   10. He said ``Be good and you will be lonesome.'' He also said
``Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good
example.'' And he gave this sound advice: ``When in doubt, tell the
truth.'' His name was:
</P>
<P>
   a) Abraham Lincoln
</P>
<P>
   b) Mark Twain
</P>
<P>
   c) Artemus Ward
</P>
<P>
   11. This genial humorist had enjoyed a good dinner well
lubricated by spirits but on leaving the restaurant he met a
drenching downpour. Happily, he saw a heavily braided uniform that
signaled a doorman and asked the man to hail a cab. ``Sir, I'm a
four-star admiral!'' said the outraged officer. ``Well then,'' said
our diner, ``hail me a battleship!'' The diner's name was:
</P>
<P>
   a) Robert Benchley
</P>
<P>
   b) Oscar Levant
</P>
<P>
   c) Ring Lardner
</P>
<P>
   12. President Abraham Lincoln often irritated this Civil War
general by asking for more detailed accounts of his army, leading
the general on one occasion to wire his commander-in-chief: ``We
have just captured six cows. What shall we do with them?''
Unperturbed, Lincoln wired back: ``Milk them.'' Who was the
general?
</P>
<P>
   a) Ulysses Grant
</P>
<P>
   b) George McClellan
</P>
<P>
   c) Daniel Tyler
</P>
<P>
   13. Here's an easy one, the legendary wire sent by a famous
comedian to the Friar's Club of Hollywood: ``Please accept my
resignation. I don't want to belong to any club that will accept me
as a member.'' Who sent the wire?
</P>
<P>
   a) Groucho Marx
</P>
<P>
   b) Harpo Marx
</P>
<P>
   c) Zeppo Marx
</P>
<P>
   14. Perhaps the most famous saying of this noted wit was

anything good about someone, sit right here by me.'' Her name was:
</P>
<P>
   a) Clare Booth Luce
</P>
<P>
   b) Alice Roosevelt Longworth
</P>
<P>
   c) Dorothy Parker
</P>
<P>
   15. This witty lady also famously said: ``I do wish ---- ----
did not look as if he had been weaned on a pickle.'' (She herself
attributed the remark to a fellow patient of her doctor's.) She was
referring to:
</P>
<P>
   a) Warren Harding
</P>
<P>
   b) Calvin Coolidge
</P>
<P>
   c) Herbert Hoover
</P>
<P>
   16. New Englander Calvin Coolidge was well known for his laconic
nature. When a lady seated next to him at dinner said she had made
a bet that she could get more than two words out of him, he
replied, ``You lose.'' On being asked what a reverend preaching on
sin had said, he summed up, ``He said he was against it.'' Perhaps
best known of all his remarks is his pithy political statement: ``I
do not choose to run for president in:
</P>
<P>
   a) 1924
</P>
<P>
   b) 1928
</P>
<P>
   c) 1932
</P>
<P>
   17. When poker-faced Calvin Coolidge died in 1933, this noted
American wit quipped: ``How can they tell?'' So said:
</P>
<P>
   a) H.L. Mencken
</P>
<P>
   b) Dorothy Parker
</P>
<P>
   c) Frank Sullivan
</P>
<P>
   18. ``An egotist is a person of low taste, more interested in
himself than in me.'' So said:
</P>
<P>
   a) Ambrose Bierce
</P>
<P>
   b) Bret Harte
</P>
<P>
   c) Artemus Ward
</P>
<P>
   19. Fanny Dixwell Holmes, the wife of Supreme Court Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., often remained at home when her husband
went to social gatherings, but on this occasion she did make an
appearance and was engaged in conversation by none other than the
president of the United States, greatly amusing him with this
remark: ``Washington is full of famous men and the women they
married when they were young.'' Who was the chief executive who
roared at her sally?
</P>
<P>
   a) Theodore Roosevelt
</P>
<P>
   b) William Howard Taft
</P>
<P>
   c) Woodrow Wilson
</P>
<P>
   20. Another U.S. president made this wry observation about the

<P>

</P>
<P>

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Neal Johnston is a lawyer who gardens in New York City.
 By NEAL JOHNSTON  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My wife and I disagree about most things, including almost
everything in the garden. So she gets the backyard and I get the
top-floor deck. She likes tall, delicate, spiky things. I prefer
loud, vulgar, splashy things. One such vulgarity is the caladium, a
flowerless low-lying leafy thing that resembles leftover Christmas
wrappings.
</P>
<P>
   The standard catalogs generally offer a half-dozen varieties of
caladium, which should satisfy most tastes. But two minutes with a
search engine leads straight to the handful of commercial caladium
growers around Lake Placid, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   These farms supply the mail-order houses, and in this case, if
home gardeners are willing to buy in lots of 25 bulbs where five
would normally do, they can quickly find twice as many choices at
half the regular price.
</P>
<P>
   All American mail-order gardening companies are now online, from
niche nurseries to the giant ones that fill a gardener's mailbox
and fulfill fantasies in January and February _ such as Park Seed
(www.parkseed.com), Stokes Seeds (www.stokeseeds.com) and Burpee
Seeds and Plants (www.burpee.com). And with gardeners in the United
States spending about $5 billion to watch things grow, all are
struggling to exploit the technology. So far, the growth of
gardening Web sites has been slow, and it has been almost entirely
native.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many gardeners are sure to switch to electronic
ordering. Not having to find a stamp or add up all those .95's at
the end of every price is an argument-winning convenience.
Selection, as opposed to ordering, is a different matter. The
industry consensus is that so far, the bulk of the e-commerce
gardening business involves new gardeners. The old hands still
spread the catalogs over the coffee table and spend half the winter
gazing at the midsummer marvels that always look best in February.
</P>
<P>
   But the move onto the Internet is inevitable. Those beautiful
catalogs are not cheap.
</P>
<P>
   For example, three years ago, White Flower Farm, a classic among
East Coast mail-order garden companies, bought Daffodil Mart, a
well-respected source of virtually every jonquil, tazetta and
cyclamineus daffodil ever named. It would be ridiculous excess for
White Flower to incorporate 600 different daffodil bulbs into its
fall catalog; it would be no less a waste to reduce the serious
specialists' choices to one-tenth of the number traditionally
listed by Daffodil Mart.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, White Flower Farm will post all the old Daffodil
Mart options on its Web site and continue to sell the four or five
dozen standard bulbs through its catalog.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce seems most likely to affect the garden's exotica: it
is a natural for the novice and the specialist. For the vast
middle, accustomed to ordering King Alfred daffodils by mail and
stopping by the garden center to eye a flat of white impatiens, its
utility will be restricted to ordering the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Only one company has its sights set on serving the entire
dirty-fingernail set: Garden.com, which was created in 1995 in
Austin, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   The company has contracted with about 70 nurseries nationwide,
each shipping directly to the buyer. The scattered inventory has
about 20,000 items, from seeds, plants and cut flowers to books and
garden gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Its Web site, at www.garden.com, is thoughtful, and its sales
last quarter tripled to $3.6 million from $1.2 million in the same
period the year before. But in the best e-commerce tradition, its
losses were even more impressive, rising to $7.2 million last
quarter from $2.1 million for the same period a year ago. The
company says it expects to turn a profit at the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Garden.com is a wonder world for the novice, and it is the
novice it has reached so far. The company says 90 percent of its
customers do not order through the mail, which creates
head-scratching by the experienced gardener who finds the site. For
instance, at the end of the season, Garden.com was offering
amaryllis buffs more than five dozen kinds of bulbs (at half price,
no less), and at the same time was offering four different types of
morning glory seedlings for $4.25 each. The only thing more certain
to grow than a morning glory seed is a child's foot, so only
gardeners with a profound mistrust of the post office would think
of ordering a morning glory seedling in late winter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the unsure and even for the expert, the options have
been enormously enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, a gasp of discovery and despair resonated
through the gardening world when yellow clivias were suddenly
available, at several hundred dollars for a flowering plant. The
clivia takes five years from germination to flower, but what
results is a wondrous foot-high stalk bearing a globe of red-orange
florets that last almost as long as an orchid and leave a rattle of
attractive seeds that glide from green to red to deep maroon over
12 months. It is a splendid way to thumb one's nose at mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that price was too steep even for the strangest of
colors. Two years later, the catalogs offered yellow clivia seeds.
I ordered two, for $40, with the near promise that five years later
at least one would turn into a yellow plant. After the indignity of
being put on a waiting list, I got my two seeds, and in three more
years may have something to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   My law partner, who can't tell a rhizome from a res ipsa
loquitor, went to the Web and tracked down the South African
hybridizer. At www.clivia.co.za, he ordered three seeds for a mere
$20.
</P>
<P>
   But as international as the Web may be, seeds and plants are a
focus of every country's border police, and retail commerce in
greenery is wrapped in red tape. Each order of yellow clivia seed
requires a $15 ``phytosanitary'' certificate.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dutch with their tulips and the Brazilians with their
passionflowers and the South Africans with their gesneriads put
their wares online, the American gardener may be exceedingly
frustrated by all the material that is not quite available at the
click of a mouse.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What an April Fools' Day. I got taken in by
everything. I thought these things were all Harvard Lampoon jokes.
</P>
<P>
   How about this one? Al Gore interrupted his calls for campaign
finance reform (as opposed to his phone calls for campaign
financing) to repudiate President Clinton's position on 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to give permanent resident status to the Cuban boy
and his father _ in exchange for the worn-out ball of silly putty
that passes as Gore's conscience.
</P>
<P>
   That shyster just lost my vote, if he ever had it. He's worse
than the other shyster.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is playing footsie with the worst right-wing child-stealers
in the world, a bunch of nuts who don't care about the kid but just
want to pull Castro's beard _ even if they have to fight the
federal government in the streets of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been captured by Elian Nation.
</P>
<P>
   There's another bad joke. The biggest family values and foreign
policy issue of the election year is a tug-of-war over a lost kid.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore has come down four-square on the side of two-timing his
boss and talking out of both sides of his mouth. The least he can
do is keep his mouth shut. But Gore has remained true to his
pandering instincts and his inability to be true to anything.
</P>
<P>
   What an April Fools' weekend it was for Democrats. George W.
Bush is the candidate with integrity.
</P>
<P>
   And how about this one: California Gov. Gray Davis has been
suggested as a possible vice presidential running mate for Gore,
which sounds plausible. It's hard to think of any better way to
make Gore seem charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being made of the same wood, Gore and Davis are
philosophically in synch. Raising money is their main concern, and
opportunism their operative word.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been appointing right-wingers to the state's parole
boards to protect his right flank. To protect his left flank, he
points to his junk gun bill.
</P>
<P>
   Go in a gun store, and you'll see how effective it's been.
You'll see the same wares, junk and non-junk.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has changed, except that when you buy a gun you're asked
if you've bought a gun in the last month. That's how the
one-gun-a-month bill is enforced _ by taking purchasers' word.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' vaunted gun-control measures are a joke _ almost as big a
joke as his running for vice president on the snooze ticket with
Gore. Unless Gore picks Elian as his running mate.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ For a Texan, one thing stood out quite prominently at
the recent Geneva Motor Show, one of the world's premier annual
automotive events: Pickups were few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on the highways of Switzerland _ and the rest of
Europe, for that matter _ pickups are rare. Perhaps it's all the
foggy, rainy days, as anything in the pickup's bed would be
subjected to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   But this European disdain for the pickup is due to more than
just the weather. A look through the seven exhibit halls at
Palexpo, the Geneva convention center that is home to the motor
show, gave the visitor a keen sense of the practicality of European
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Cars, very little cars, ruled the showroom floor. Cars that get
upwards of 40 mpg, something vital to consumers on a continent
where gasoline sells for an average of $5 per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Highways and city streets are quite narrow throughout much of
Europe, too, which makes driving a large vehicle quite a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Europeans do buy the occasional big sport-utility, such as
a Range Rover, Toyota Land Cruiser or Jeep Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who drive those vehicles are among the
continent's most affluent, and they can afford to fill those huge
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Most Europeans drive tiny little cars that we'll probably never
see in the United States, and particularly in Texas, where we
always think BIG in everything, especially cars and hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the cutest or ugliest cars (that depends on the
individual's point of view, and there seems to be no in-between) at
this year's Geneva show, held last month, were the Fiat Ecobasic
and the Mercedes-Benz Smart.
</P>
<P>
   These are the tiniest of econoboxes, smaller even than the
British Mini Cooper, designed for city driving and the most minimum
use of precious fuel. They come with just two seats, small engines
and fuel-economy ratings that have them barely sipping gasoline or
diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Most automakers who sell vehicles in Europe have developed cars
in this segment _ even Mercedes-Benz, whose A-class minicar sells
for under $20,000 and is a big hit among Continental consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes has no plans to sell the A-class in the United States,
however, and it's not just because Americans generally eschew such
small vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   No, the main reason we won't see an A-class sold at U.S.
Mercedes-Benz dealerships is because it's not expensive enough.
Mercedes officials don't believe that a cheap, mass-market vehicle
such as the A-class would be a good mix with its line of luxury
cars.
</P>
<P>
   BMW does plan to introduce a minicar to the U.S. market next
year in the form of the next-generation Mini, developed while BMW
owned Britain's Rover Group, which builds the Mini Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   What sales channel BMW will use for the Mini is not clear, but
one thing is: It won't be sold at traditional BMW dealerships,
whose line of cars is similar to that of Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   Small sport-utility vehicles were a big hit at Geneva this year,
because while Europeans generally can't afford or don't want the
hassle of driving huge SUVs, they still like the concept of the
sport-utility.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota showed off its second-generation RAV4 mini-SUV, Ford
introduced its Escape, and Tata, India's No. 1 automaker, displayed
its Safari, a 90-horsepower model about the size of the Escape
(which goes on sale later this year at U.S. Ford dealerships).
</P>
<P>
   Small vans and panel trucks are huge sellers in Europe, and
almost every mass-market automaker has two or three in its lineup.
Those vehicles were prominent throughout the Palexpo halls.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were the Renault Kangoo and the Toyota Yaris.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, these are quite odd-looking little vans, but their
body styles are popular with Europeans. This type of car is the
European's idea of a utility vehicle, because it can be used to
haul people or cargo, and the cargo is inside, protected from the
elements.
</P>
<P>
   The closest we've seen to these tiny vans in the United States
have been vehicles such as the 1980s Toyota Tercel four-wheel-drive
wagon, the Mitsubishi Expo and the Dodge Colt Vista wagon.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One tiny, very practical vehicle at the Geneva show could become
a niche-market star in the United States: the Twike.ME.
</P>
<P>
   This essentially is a fully-enclosed, three-wheel, two-seat
electric motorcycle that also can be pedaled.
</P>
<P>
   Built by SwissLEM Ltd., the Twike.ME carries two people and
their luggage, goes up to 52.7 mph, and can negotiate slopes up to
22 degrees. Known as a ``light electric vehicle with complementary
pedal drive,'' the Twike is quite popular with Swiss motorists.
</P>
<P>
   With aluminum space-frame construction and a plastic body, the
lightweight Twike can go up to 50 miles on a charge, and the
batteries can be recharged in under two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The driver and passenger have pedals, so the range can be
extended by pedaling instead of using the motor. For steering, the
consumer can choose between a conventional steering wheel or a
joystick.
</P>
<P>
   Electric Vehicles Northwest Inc. in Seattle is working toward
getting the Twike approved for use on U.S. highways. Check out the
Twike Web site at http://www.twike.ch/english/international.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular European minicar that eventually might find its
way to U.S. shores is the three-door, hatchback Ford Ka, powered by
a 1.3-liter, 60-horsepower gasoline engine that gets nearly 43 mpg.
</P>
<P>
   It has a top speed of 96 mph, which makes it suitable for U.S.
freeway driving, and it goes from zero to 60 mph in 14.3 seconds _
no hot rod, but adequate for most people's needs. In Britain, the
Ka sells for about $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of the cute, inexpensive cars that crowd the streets
and highways of Europe will never be seen in the United States, the
automakers say _ unless gasoline prices go a lot higher than they
are now.
</P>
<P>
   To Europeans, our gasoline prices are a bargain.

&HT;     CAN CBS SCORE A HIT WITH NEW MOB SHOW? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you're going to like CBS's very ambitious new series,
``Falcone,'' basically comes down to this: Do you have HBO or not?
</P>
<P>
   If you do, then you probably watch ``The Sopranos.'' In fact,
that show may be the reason you subscribed in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have HBO, well, hey, you're 12 bucks richer every
month, and ``Falcone'' is a decent enough mob show that's made for
television. Commercial television. And maybe you'll enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   That is: If you haven't already seen ``Donnie Brasco,'' the
feature film based _ like this show _ on the undercover exploits of
FBI agent Joe Pistone. Or ``The Godfather'' series. Or
``GoodFellas.''
</P>
<P>
   As you can tell, there are a lot of asterisks attached to this
show. It's probably not fair, but you can't throw a mob show on TV
without getting a ton of comparisons _ fair or not.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is launching ``Falcone'' (Tuesday at 9 p.m. Eastern) in a
two-hour premiere, followed by nightly viewings at 10 p.m. all the
way through April 12 (except Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   Does this show really need an explanation? If we must:
``Falcone'' essentially has two stars. There's Jason Gedrick as Joe
Falcone, an undercover FBI agent, who's in deep, tracking the mob
and simultaneously losing touch with his own family, particularly
his wife (Amy Carlson). And there's Titus Welliver as Santino
``Sonny Boy'' Napoli, burgeoning mob power player. Falcone hooks up
with Napoli and down the drain of underworld carnage and chaos they
go.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a wild ride, really. Made more intriguing by the fact
that CBS is pulling out the stops and launching this show like it
was some massive May sweeps miniseries. If people aren't hooked by
the first two hours on Tuesday, it's going to be a long, long ride
to nowhere for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   However, a substantial number of people ought to tune in for a
peek, given that CBS is pushing the show during the NCAA basketball
tournament and there's a natural curiosity in this country for mob
stories.
</P>
<P>
   But, wait. ... Is there? Taking nothing away from Gedrick and
Welliver, who make for some solid TV viewing as dark-haired tough
guys, why would anyone watch this show if a) they've seen the
movie, b) they don't have eight days of free time already blocked
out and, most importantly, c) they could watch ``The Sopranos''
instead.
</P>
<P>
   This much we know: By the time ``The Sopranos'' came on the air,
Hollywood had pretty much played out that genre. Like cop shows
before it, getting all mobbed up didn't hold the same kind of
emotional payout it once did for viewers. Been there, done that.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the brilliance of ``The Sopranos,'' which flat-out
embarrassed any other competitor, there was no longer a need to try
to do mob shows. What was the point? Unless Francis Ford Coppola or
Martin Scorsese were going to take another swing at it, the
definitive modern version of the mob was being played out every
Sunday on HBO to frighteningly great critical acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   Who would be dumb enough to launch a mob show on commercial
television where you couldn't swear, you'd have to tone down the
violence and no one could get naked? Uh, CBS, apparently. This show
was going to debut in the fall, but bending to congressional
pressure about violence on TV, the network wanted to retool the
violence and bring it back when things cooled down. Unfortunately,
things had heated up at HBO. But, not content to cede Mafia stories
to pay-TV, ``Falcone'' was put on the schedule for the rest of the
mob-hungry country that doesn't get HBO (which means most of it).
</P>
<P>
   The question remains, however: Why? Are there really millions of
people who want a watered-down, commercially interrupted,
half-challenging competitor when they can get the best show on
television on HBO?
</P>
<P>
   CBS is banking on it. That's why we have this crazy, nonstop
``Falcone'' marathon. It will be interesting to see how it all
unfolds. The show is good but not great. It feels redundant because
it is _ two times over, if you count the movie. There's no denying
that's a huge drawback, no matter how brooding Gedrick and Welliver
get. And, from a pure entertainment standpoint, it's less
satisfying to see Falcone's wife and family implode than it is to
see what's happening with Tony Soprano's home life. Sorry, but it's
true.
</P>
<P>
   CBS can't get away from its own ghosts. Several years ago it had
a tremendous mob show called ``EZ Streets.'' CBS gave up on it
quickly and that amazing little gem of a show withered and died
without much trace.
</P>
<P>
   Has CBS's audience changed that much? No, it hasn't. Should we
expect the same seldom-seen exit for this show? At least
``Falcone'' has the advantage of having the network interested in
its success. If ``EZ Streets'' had this kind of support, maybe
``The Sopranos'' would never have been made in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but that's history. The question now is, will ``Falcone''
be?

BIG HEADACHE: SCULPTURES FROM TEXAS SPARK DEBATE IN VIRGINIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSBURG, Va. _ When Thomas Jefferson came back to Virginia
two weeks ago, he didn't get a hero's welcome. There were no red
carpets, no praise-filled speeches. Many folks just wished he would
go away _ far away. Like maybe to the middle of the Mojave Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's travel mates, former Presidents Martin Van Buren,
Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan,
didn't fare any better. That might seem odd, given the Williamsburg
area's obsession with history.
</P>
<P>
   But these heads of state are just that. Heads. Big concrete
heads, some standing 18 feet tall. And for some who take their
history _ and community image _ seriously, they are just too
``tacky, tawdry and tasteless.''
</P>
<P>
   The statues are the work of Houston sculptor David Adickes, the
artist who created the towering concrete statue of Sam Houston
erected near Huntsville, Texas, and the disembodied cellist on the
plaza of downtown Houston's Lyric Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Before year's end, Adickes and his Virginia backers hope to
install the six presidential heads _ along with 35 others now
stored in Adickes' Houston warehouse-studio _ in a forested
educational park in York County, just outside Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Adickes, 73, believes the statues will perfectly complement
Colonial Williamsburg _ the meticulously restored/re-created
British capital of colonial America _ and nearby Yorktown, site of
the last major battle of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The first six heads, which arrived March 17, were to have been
temporarily displayed on their pedestals at a Days Inn owned by
Adickes' partner, Williamsburg real estate developer Everette H.
Newman III. The planned, but later aborted, display was designed as
a ``show and tell'' to ease the project's way through the
permitting process.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it launched a withering fusillade of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surely not in danger of overgentrification as long as
these Barnumlike entrepreneurs are able to push such things off on
us,'' one resident raged in an unsigned letter to a local
newspaper. ``My wife and I considered and rejected a suicide pact,
but we are thinking seriously of moving on if this abomination is
approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivor Noel Hume, who for 18 years was chief archaeologist for the
Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, agreed. ``The proposed Presidents
Park has to be the tackiest project to exploit and pollute
America's heritage since composer-lyricist Kermit Goel turned
Pocahontas into a musical, and that was nigh on 40 years ago,'' he
fumed.
</P>
<P>
   W.C. O'Donovan, editor and publisher of the feisty twice-weekly
Virginia Gazette _ which boasts of its 1736 founding as the first
paper in the South _ insisted that the statue park would be better
situated in the wide-open spaces of the Mojave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Williamsburg would have been much better served if
Adickes had taken up painting miniatures,'' he huffed.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Gazette readers responding to the
paper's ``Heads or Tails'' poll opposed the project. Overall,
critics felt the heads insufficiently ``authentic'' to join the
Peninsula's historic milieu, defined by Colonial Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Adickes, who has invested four years and $1 million in the
project, seemed nonplussed by the uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is missing the point,'' Adickes said last
week. ``This is not a slapdash thing thrown together. It is as
authentic as any contemporary sculpture can be. It is a very
high-level thing for people to go to. It's one more thing that can
be listed among attractions of the Williamsburg area.''
</P>
<P>
   Adickes said his presidential head project was inspired by Mount
Rushmore in Keystone, S.D. _ and by the fact that the presidential
visages there were hard to appreciate without binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with the first six heads to Virginia, Adickes noted
that passing motorists frequently snapped photos of the
presidential caravan, even at night. At fueling stops, Adickes
frequently was beseeched for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   The project's target audiences, he suggested, are schoolchildren
and a mythical couple he named ``R.V. Harvey and his wife, Lou.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's R.V. like `Recreational Vehicle,''' Adickes said.
``Retired people. R.V. Harvey and his wife, Lou. They eat at
Shoney's and stay there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He likened the project's critics to painter Grant Wood's
portrayal of Daughters of the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're there with their teacups and snarled-up faces,''
Adickes said. ``Williamsburg is full of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, there are people who are trying to balance
the books. Williamsburg is slipping. The cultural tide is turning
against the purity of beautiful little places. (Nearby) Busch
Gardens and other places are running away with their clients.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the prime nonhistorical attractions in the Williamsburg
area is Water Country USA, a water park developed by Adickes'
partner, Newman. It now is owned by Busch Gardens, which attracts
about 2.5 million visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're having to do something within taste to improve their
overall economic picture. Those who understand that are in favor of
doing things to bring tourists,'' Adickes continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Williamsburg. I'm thrilled every time I go there. They
have re-created that century very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Andrews, spokesman for Colonial Williamsburg, which includes
88 original buildings and hundreds of re-created and restored homes
and shops on its 173-acre compound, said park attendance has been
growing. As many as 3 million people visited the village in the
most recent year for which figures are available. Not all of them,
however, purchased tickets to tour houses and other historic
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said the heads will be installed on 12 landscaped acres
adjacent to his Days Inn East, just outside Williamsburg. The park
will be screened from view of passing motorists by a buffer of
natural forest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a tourist attraction in the sense of having a lot of
bells and whistles,'' Newman said. ``These presidents don't dance,
and they don't sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has developed about $25 million of projects in the
Williamsburg area, and even critics like O'Donovan credit him as
``a good guy'' for the tasteful development of Water Country USA.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said the proposed park's primary mission is educational,
and each statue will be flanked by signs explaining the president's
historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Chestnut, sales manager for Newman's FCR Group, said she is
working with educational agencies in each state to ensure that
schoolchildren visiting the site will be eligible for class credit.
She said that as many as 250,000 students might visit the park
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said much of the opposition to the presidential park
grows out of anger over other developments _ realized or only
attempted _ in the Williamsburg area. One of the most controversial
projects is a miniature golf course under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a proposal for a Ripley's Believe It Or Not
``odditorium'' was rejected, in part because of a Colonial
Williamsburg director who held a seat on the planning commission.
</P>
<P>
   The first skirmish in the battle of the heads came when York
County officials disallowed temporary display of the heads mounted
on their pedestals at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agreed that the county originally gave an informal
green light to such an exhibit. But while the heads were en route,
county officials revisited the issue and determined such display
would be prohibited by county ordinance, said Assistant County
Administrator J. Mark Carter. He said Newman will have until the
end of the week to find another temporary location for the heads,
which remain chained on flat-bed trailers in the hotel parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there was some misunderstanding,'' Carter said.
``All I can say is we regret that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut had her own theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truckers started seeing the heads as we were driving them over
and calling the radio stations about them,'' she said. ``The radio
guys, without bothering to find out, put out the word that they
were destined for an amusement park to be built in Williamsburg.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to develop the sculpture park, Carter said, Adickes and
his backers will need to petition York County for a special-use
permit. That process, which requires review by the county planning
commission and action by the board of supervisors, usually takes at
least three months.
</P>
<P>
   Newman at first said such an application might be made this
week, but later said park proponents instead might argue that the
park qualifies as a museum, which would not require a special
permit. A county spokesman said that argument already has been
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, Adickes and Carter all agreed that plans to erect a
92-foot statue of George Washington _ a component of the park that
had drawn intense criticism _ have been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the controversy, the Colonial Williamsburg
Foundation, founded in 1926 with money donated by John D.
Rockefeller Jr., has remained neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project certainly has raised eyebrows in the
neighborhood,'' said foundation spokesman Andrews. But the
organization will not consider taking a stand in the debate until
it has had opportunity to review the formal park proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Much-published archaeologist Hume, who still works as a
consultant for the foundation, had no such qualms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my feeling,'' he said, ``that the heads are simply one
manifestation of the dumbing down of history and the exploitation
of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums of punishment, matchbox museums, these sorts of things
grow up around historic places. People exploit the past as a
business, and I don't see anything wrong with that as long as it
doesn't lower the public's impressions or expectations of the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   As the controversy rages, Adickes said he actively is looking
for property for two other presidential head parks. One, he said,
might be near Mount Rushmore, where the concrete statues could warm
up visitors for Gutzon Borglum's better-known visages of
Washington, Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. He
said he also is investigating sites in the Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   A second set of statues already has been poured into rubber
molds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Virginia, the first six heads have become de facto
shrines.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the oversized head of President Reagan, cracking at the
neck from rigors of the road, lies a wilted bouquet of supermarket
flowers. A silk red rose adorns the ear of Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath Wilson _ like Jefferson, a Virginia native _ a silk rose
rests next to a lizard-green Mountain Dew bottle in a fragrant pile
of fallen dogwood blossoms.

WATCHDOG GROUPS WARN OF LIKELY ELECTION FRAUD IN PERU

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ With the presidential race tightening, election
observers are warning that the Peruvian government may tamper with
the results of Sunday's vote to guarantee victory for President
Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of fraud ``is very real,'' said one foreign
election monitor who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Fujimori campaign, he added, ``Everything up to
now points to a desire to win at all costs. You don't spend
millions of dollars putting together this type of machinery only to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Fujimori dismissed such concerns and
pledged that the Peruvian vote will be free and democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for months, the U.S. State Department, the Organization of
American States and independent observers have described Peru's
electoral process as being grossly unfair to opposition candidates
while stacking the deck in favor of Fujimori, who is running for an
unprecedented third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Little has been done to address these concerns, the observers
say, and confidence in the government's National Electoral Office,
known by its Spanish initials ONPE, to carry out a clean election
is evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, two ONPE members have been accused of taking part in a
scandal in which more than 1 million signatures may have been
forged in order to get Fujimori's name on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possible involvement of ONPE officials in the alleged
falsification scheme has damaged the credibility of the very
organization whose mandate it is to guarantee the integrity of the
electoral process,'' said a report issued March 24 by the
Atlanta-based Carter Center, which has been monitoring Peru's
electoral process since last year.
</P>
<P>
   With nine candidates in the presidential race, it may be
difficult for Fujimori to score an outright victory in Sunday's
first-round vote. If no one gets more than 50 percent of the
ballots, the two top finishers will meet in a runoff in June.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey by the Lima polling firm Apoyo showed
Fujimori's support at 37 percent and that of second-place candidate
Alejandro Toledo at 27 percent. In a runoff, many analysts believe
that the divided opposition could unite behind Toledo and sweep him
to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Toledo is moving up in the polls and it looks like
Fujimori could lose in a second round, it's obvious that there are
dangers of fraud in the first round,'' said one Peruvian election
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts claim that many officials in the Fujimori government
are desperate to remain in power, because they fear a slew of
lawsuits over alleged human rights violations, corruption and other
abuses should Toledo win.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities for the government to steal the election are vast,
according to Transparency, an independent Peruvian electoral
watchdog body.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, due to the lack of volunteers in outlying areas,
monitors from opposition parties will be present at just one-third
of the 87,000 voting precincts. The rest will be staffed only by
government electoral workers and the military. Problems could occur
during the initial, manual counting of ballots or the
transportation of electoral materials, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   Transparency points out that the vote count and the settling of
any disputes will be done by electoral workers and untenured
judges, many of whom owe their jobs to the Fujimori regime.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the results are tallied, the ballots will be
destroyed. In many mountain and remote jungle villages, the
military _ which has been fiercely loyal to Fujimori over the past
10 years _ will transport census sheets with the results to larger
cities, where they will be fed into computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For fraud to take place, the army has to cooperate precisely
because of this role they have in transporting the vote tallies,''
said Coletta Youngers, an expert on Peru at the Washington Office
on Latin America, a think tank known as WOLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an area that will be very difficult for international
monitors to watch. It is the weakest link in the chain,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there have been increasing calls by opposition
candidates and some Peruvian newspapers for the military to stay
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent interview at the government palace in Lima,
Fujimori dismissed such scenarios as sour grapes by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidates with the least support are always the ones who
cry fraud,'' Fujimori said. ``In spite of the imperfections that
must be corrected and are being corrected, this is simply one more
Peruvian election, like the one we had in 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to a WOLA report, the 1995 election was no model
of electoral hygiene. For example, even though Peruvian security
forces are banned by the Constitution from voting, about 50,000
police and army soldiers cast ballots in the 1995 elections. the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no doubt that Fujimori won the presidential
race, the 1995 congressional election was rife with irregularities,
WOLA said. Nearly 7 percent of the ballots disappeared, and 41
percent were nullified by electoral authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls in 1995 predicted that Fujimori's coalition
would get 25 percent to 35 percent of the seats in Congress. But
official results gave the president's coalition an all-important
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS, which declared elections in Panama in 1989 and the
Dominican Republic in 1994 to be rigged, could come to the same
conclusion in Peru, according to Eduardo Stein, who heads the OAS
team monitoring the process.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Fujimori wins in a clean election Sunday, Peruvians may
have little faith in the results due to all the shenanigans leading
up to the vote, according to Santiago Pedraglio, a columnist for
the Lima newspaper Gestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will believe it,'' he said.

   Despite the precautions, Evans said recently, he constantly
worries that a mistake will happen. Stressing that police from 27
departments _ from federal, state and city agencies, as well as
colleges and universities _ are involved in law enforcement in
Boston, Evans said: ``It's awfully easy for something to go wrong.
. . . A tragedy like that can mar a department and a city for an
awfully long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, the former Boston commissioner, says racial
stereotyping adds extra peril for black police officers working
undercover. ``If you talk to them, you'll hear how black police
officers know it's a problem and it worries them,'' Bratton said.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is serious enough that one major organization that
represents black police officers now routinely recommends that they
think twice before taking on undercover assignments. New York City
Police Lieutenant Eric Adams, head of 100 Blacks in Law
Enforcement, said, ``Until it is as safe for an African-American to
work undercover as it is for a white man, I would urge my
colleagues not to take those assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement
Officers has not taken a position on the issue, according to its
head, Boston Patrolman Larry Brown. Because of the precautions
Evans put in place, black officers can decide themselves if
undercover work is too dangerous, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, as elsewhere, the percentage of blacks assigned to
undercover work is usually greater than their overall numbers on
the police force. For example, 42 percent of the rank-and-file
officers assigned to the Strike Force, which concentrates on gang
violence in Boston, are black, while the department itself is 26
percent black.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of black officers retreating from undercover
work concerns most police commanders. Blacks working in such
undercover assignments are ``essential to our crime-fighting
capacity,'' said Sergeant Detective Margot Hill, spokeswoman for
the Boston Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the problem of racial stereotyping has some black
officers rethinking how they ought to respond when witnessing a
crime in progress while they are off duty. In many cities,
including Boston, off-duty officers are required to respond to
crimes they witness, whether in uniform or not. But that does not
mean they have to pull their guns, some officers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell my colleagues to be a good witness to the events that
are going on; the crisis will resolve itself in due time, and
they'll be safe and be able to testify as to what happened,'' said
R. Muhammed Bessard, a 26-year veteran of the Berkeley, Calif.,
department.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald E. Hampton, executive director of the National Black
Police Association, said he believes Young's death in Providence
might have been prevented if the federal government had previously
identified this problem in undercover police work and coordinated a
program to make departments aware of the danger. He also said that
black officers should have considered the problem more serious than
they have.
</P>
<P>
   Having been a policeman for 23 years, and as head of the
organization that represents about 15,000 black law enforcement
officers, Hampton said the problem is significantly worse than
shown by the 12 shooting casualties in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of us knows of near misses or of people being
roughed up without being badly hurt that just never make the news
because the (black) police officer just doesn't want to buck the
system,'' said Hampton. ``The number of officers shot is bad
enough, but it's lucky that it's not a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton and leaders from other black police organizations have
met with Justice Department officials on several occasions since
1995, asking that more attention be paid to whether racial
profiling contributes to these shootings. While the federal agency
has investigated two recent shootings for possible civil rights
violations, it has not filed any charges, said a Justice Department
official who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   As for an investigation of the overall problem of racial
stereotyping faced by minority officers while undercover or off
duty, the official said that the Justice Department has lacked
statutory authority to conduct such a probe until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno
announced that the Justice Department would establish a committee
to take an in-depth look at policing in the United States. It is
likely that the problem of racial profiling would be taken up by
the committee, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A top White House official on race issues said the federal
government and individual police departments should be doing far
more to prevent minority officers from being shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would urge departments to provide better training and come
up with better ways of identifying police officers who are
undercover or in plainclothes,'' said Robert Ben Johnson, executive
director of the President's Initiative for One America. ``We're
seeing the awful consequences of these things: It is agonizingly
painful for a family to go through and it divides communities along
racial lines.''

PRESCRIPTIONS ELUSIVE FOR CURBING MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Microsoft Corp. and prosecutors tried to
negotiate an antitrust settlement, they bogged down over how to
craft a loophole-free agreement that gave the famously aggressive
software maker no room to wriggle out of its promised changes in
behavior, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the same problem will likely face Federal District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the case.
</P>
<P>
   With settlement talks collapsing on Saturday, Jackson is
expected to issue his verdict this week on whether Microsoft broke
the nation's antitrust laws. All indications are that he will rule
that Microsoft did violate the law, and that the trial should next
consider what penalty is in order.
</P>
<P>
   But as the judge tries to fashion a penalty, some analysts say
he will run into the same problems that hampered the settlement
talks: How to put limits on a diverse and aggressive company that
maintains complex relationships with both allies and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard enough for the government and Microsoft, working
directly with each other, to fashion a workable set of conduct
remedies,'' or limits on Microsoft's business behavior, said Rich
Gray, a Menlo Park, Calif., antitrust lawyer who has followed the
case closely. ``It's going to be even harder for a federal judge to
impose a workable set of remedies based on arguments and briefs and
a formal hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Justice and 19 states charge that Microsoft
illegally used its Windows software monopoly to bully other
companies into taking actions that hurt consumers, and to try to
crush two companies, Netscape Communications Corp. and Sun
Microsystems Inc., which produced potential rivals to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing 76 days of testimony, Jackson issued ``findings of
fact'' last November that sided overwhelmingly with prosecutors and
portrayed Microsoft as a ruthless monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of settlement talks, which had been mediated by a
federal judge in Chicago, show how complex Jackson's task could be
if, as expected, he rules that Microsoft's conduct merits a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   His challenge could be glimpsed in the Justice Department's last
settlement offer, which, according to sources, held that Microsoft
would be required to set a uniform pricing schedule for Windows.
Microsoft would not be able, for example, to raise the price of
Windows for a computer-maker who wanted to load Netscape's Internet
browser, and not Microsoft's browser, on the computers it sold.
</P>
<P>
   But critics among the 19 states, as well as Microsoft's rivals
in the computer industry, complained that price was just one
mechanism that Microsoft uses to manipulate other companies, one
source said. Microsoft could still bully companies by backing out
of joint marketing deals or by withholding the right to display the
Windows logo on their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the software industry is that companies have
ongoing, deeply integrated business relationships,'' said one
person familiar with the prosecutors' thinking. ``With Windows,
it's not like you sell someone a car and they drive off the lot
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, this source said, the final Justice Department
proposal required Microsoft to reveal, for a fee, the most basic
computer code of Windows so that computer-makers could make
modifications. A computer-maker might include Netscape's browser
with Windows and make sure that the two products worked well
together. Or the computer-maker could change the screen that users
see when the first turn the computer on.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft reserved the right to withhold technical
support from parts of the software that had been altered. Critics
said that made the concession meaningless, because no
computer-maker would accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Ford saying that if you buy a new hood ornament,
your engine warranty is violated,'' said Ed Black, president of the
Computer and Communications Industry Association, which favors
tough sanctions against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also proposed, according to one source,
that Microsoft could integrate new features into Windows, but that
it could not write sales contracts that forced anyone to buy a
second Microsoft product along with Windows. Black said that
provision was weak, because Microsoft had many ways to bully
computer-makers into adopting Microsoft products and rejecting
products from Microsoft rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Justice Department proposal were requirements that
Microsoft reveal software code that allows other software-makers to
link their own products to Windows, and that technical information
be shared equally with all of Microsoft's partners without
discrimination. Justice Department lawyers also wanted to bar
Microsoft from raising the price of old versions of Windows when a
new one is released, a tactic Microsoft uses to encourage buyers to
adopt the newest edition of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Black said that the issue of how to enforce any agreement with
Microsoft was paramount, because the company had been so aggressive
in the past. In fact, it signed a consent decree to settle an
earlier case with the government, only to be accused by prosecutors
a year later of violating the terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Gray said it is difficult to enforce any company's promise
to change its practices. Even when company rules bar it, an
aggressive sales force or business-development team may want to cut
special deals on pricing or advertising to move a company's
products into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is a big organization, and for them to fully police
something with full internal cooperation is a non-trivial
exercise,'' Gray said. ``For an outside government agency to police
it . . . is just damn hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to go to the question of `Can the government
trust Microsoft?' before I get pessimistic about the value of
conduct remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative would be to impose a structural change on
Microsoft, such as breaking the company into pieces, possibly one
that produces Windows and one that makes other types of software.
</P>
<P>
   That penalty is considered by far the most extreme, but those
most critical of Microsoft say it is the only way to strip
Microsoft of one of its major advantages: the fact that it makes
both the Windows operating system and the word processors, Internet
browsers, graphics programs and other ``applications'' products
that works in conjunction with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and several of its allies sought to blame several of
the 19 state attorneys general in the case for the breakdown of
settlement talks. ``It's unfortunate that an outspoken minority of
AGs is holding the industry hostage by derailing settlement talks
at a time when resolution seemed possible,'' said Jonathan Zuck,
president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade
group that includes Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The National Taxpayers Union faulted ``overzealous state
attorneys general'' who ``would rather make headlines that make
headway toward ending this case.''
</P>
<P>
   But one person familiar with proceedings said that the feeling
was fairly uniform among states about what the settlement should
include, though states most involved in the talks may have
developed the strongest feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he doubted the deal fell apart just because of the
states. ``It's clear that Microsoft did not meet Justice's
standards for an agreement, regardless of meeting the standards set
by the states,'' Gray said.

THE GRAYING OF A MOVEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The woman at the megaphone, Sacha Sanchez, is a familiar
character in the street theater surrounding Elian Gonzalez. Each
day she launches into a monologue attacking anyone who dares
suggest that the little boy should some day return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez talks and talks and talks. She routinely screeches into
her bullhorn for well over an hour the following screed: Clinton
has no guts; no morals, either. Every time she sees him she thinks
of Monica Lewinsky. Hillary Clinton traveled to Cuba in the
mid-1970s (understand that this registers as a major offense to
this audience, true or not) and is a secret sympathizer with the
Castro regime. Janet Reno practically has blood on her hands.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is a middle-aged woman who has lived in Miami for far
longer than she lived in Cuba. She is at the vanguard of a graying
movement, the hardcore anti-Fidels. These are people whose politics
have been shaped by betrayal and nostalgia. The sad saga playing
out here taps into their longstanding grievances against Castro and
their equally enduring dream of an end to exile.
</P>
<P>
   It is they, not the Cuban-Americans who were born here, who
provide the most vocal support for Elian. There are individual
exceptions, of course. One spots the occasional twenty-something
carrying a Cuban flag, or a picture of the boy. In the city beyond
the barricades, there is broad belief that Fidel is a maggot, and
that anything that makes him uncomfortable merits support. If the
exile community could vote on a country for Elian, America would
win hands down.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, particularly in the 1970s, the Cuban question
routinely whipped people here into a frenzy. One Spanish-language
talk show host lost his legs in a car bombing that was believed to
be the work of those who found him insufficiently hardline in his
opposition to Castro's policies. Musicians and actors who had
appeared in Cuba could not perform in Miami; paintings that had
been displayed there were not welcome in galleries here _ unless a
curator didn't mind the risk of having his or her place blown up.
Any talk of the US trade embargo was unacceptable, save for praise
for the government's commitment to ``freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent years have brought neither retreat nor surrender, but at
least a bit of calm. It has become possible to publicly question
the embargo and live to tell. Nothing has been bombed in a while.
The Fidel death watch continues, of course, but at a slightly lower
level of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   To many younger Cuban-Americans _ the two generations raised
here in the last 40 years, most of whom have never set foot on
Cuban soil _ Elian's fate is mildly interesting, but not the stuff
of life and death. As one old friend said to me this weekend, ``I
hope the kid stays. But, hey, I've got a mortgage. And that's how
most younger Cubans I know feel.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend probably doesn't know Josephine Betancourt, or
Mercedes Rodriguez. Both in their 60s, they insisted Sunday they
would give up anything, even life itself, before they would see
Castro win. They've lived under Castro and know what a horror it
would be for Elian to go back, they said. They both said they are
inspired by the belief that Elian's mother died for his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to die for him,'' said Rodriguez. ``Other people
are going to die for him. He represents motherhood and freedom and
life and all the children under the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   For some people here, Castro will always be a life-and-death
matter. His regime ended capitalism, oppressed and impoverished
untold numbers of people, and created a generation of political
prisoners. Most poignantly to them, he destroyed the notion of
home, of safety. Decades later, they thunder from exile, from new
homes the reality of which cannot dislodge their memories of
paradise lost. Through an unlikely sequence of events, they are
holding fiercely onto something they believe Castro holds dear,
and, as their foe Bill Clinton might say, they intend to fight
until the last dog dies.

BATTLE OF THE BROKERS HEATS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you like to trade stocks on the Web, there's a maniacal race
under way for your business.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only the specialty online brokers like ETrade and the
discount brokerage pioneers like Charles Schwab who are vying for
your dollars. It's also the mutual fund companies, such as Fidelity
Investments, the traditional Wall Street investment houses,
including Merrill Lynch, and the banks and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cerulli Associates, a Boston financial research firm, says in
its new Internet report that no fewer than 160 US companies are
doing battle in the online brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
   Half are discount brokers, companies like Schwab that were the
first to provide advice-free stock transactions, for less money
than the full-service Wall Street brokers would do it.
</P>
<P>
   One-third are the new Internet-based brokers that have sprung up
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The rest are day-trading firms, old-line brokers, and banks.
</P>
<P>
   The rush into this business has spurred what Cerulli dubs the
``Internet effect'': There are now 21 million discount brokerage
accounts, more than half of them online. Without the Internet,
Cerulli estimates, there would be only 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the value of assets in online accounts has surged,
from $27.7 billion to $754.4 billion. Cerulli predicts $2.2
trillion by the end of 2004, as the number of online accounts rises
to about 34 million. As many as 85 percent of all brokerage
accounts could be online by then.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind this stampede to Web investing?
</P>
<P>
   The bull market has helped, specialists say, by making it appear
easy to profit from stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But people also seem to like the do-it-yourself factor.
</P>
<P>
   Observed John Payne, a Cerulli consultant who coauthored the
report: ``Psychologically, there's a freedom there, that nobody's
really watching you. You don't have to have any human contact at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The big traditional brokers, such as Merrill Lynch and
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, like to think their advice is worth
having _ and paying for. Indeed, as investors accumulate
substantial assets before retirement, many turn to brokers or
financial advisers for help.
</P>
<P>
   But even those old-economy giants have taken the plunge into
online investing. Some wealthy customers like to trade a portion of
their money on their own, and young investors are more likely to
use DLJdirect, Donaldson Lufkin's online brokerage, than to pay
full fees to a human broker when their account holds only $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Different players are tackling this market in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity hopes its mutual fund investors will open brokerage
accounts, even as it works to attract new brokerage business from
outside its current customer ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade does direct marketing to bring in business and offers
incentives, such as $75 in cash for opening a new account.
</P>
<P>
   All the spending to bring in new clients has diverted attention
from customer service, Payne said. As a result, the online brokers
have been scrambling to add staff and phone lines to deal with the
crush of investors who call on volatile market days or when Web
sites crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rush to grab market share, online brokerage firms are
allocating lots of money to advertising to attract business,
instead of upping their service to keep up,'' Payne said. But with
so many people trading online, he noted, expectations for good
service are rising: Firms ``can never sit back and say, `OK, we've
got it now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So who's winning the battle?
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Schwab is still the undisputed king,
according to Cerulli's research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schwab has just done a phenomenal job of scaring the pants off
everyone,'' Cerulli consultant Kelly O'Donnell said. ``They're a
force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, Schwab boasted a 46 percent share of
the online brokerage market, Cerulli found. Fidelity placed second,
at 19 percent, having lost a few points last year. TD Waterhouse
was third, with a 12 percent share, up from 7 percent two years
ago. The other top online players are ETrade, Ameritrade,
DLJdirect, Suretrade, Discover, Datek, and NDB.
</P>
<P>
   The key is finding the best broker for your needs. Many analysts
and financial magazines rate the brokers on price, Web site
quality, customer service, and investment offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few independent sites to check before you sign up, or
if you want to shop around:
</P>
<P>
   --Gomez.com
</P>
<P>
   --TheStreet.com
</P>
<P>
   _ SmartMoney.com
</P>
<P>
   As online investing accelerates, service will become more
important, Payne said. Investors may like to trade with no human
interference. But if they have a problem or need advice, they will
want a lifeline. Firms that are able to offer both will be the
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the human element is going to be the big
differentiating factor,'' he said.

DRUG VOTE AT AMHERST LIFTS STUDENTS' SPIRITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, Mass. _ With a wreath of plastic cannabis plants in her
hair, an attention-getting red strobe light, and a broomstick to
point at passersby, University of Massachusetts freshman Erin
Pfeiffer last week prodded her fellow students to overcome their
historical apathy and do what few have done before: vote in the
town's election.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old psychology major's interest in local politics
wasn't motivated by a passion for fighting suburban sprawl or
beefing up the town's recycling program. Her aim was more personal:
to make Amherst a beacon of hope for marijuana smokers around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the hard work of Pfeiffer and her fellow members
of the Cannabis Reform Coalition, it has become just that. With
record numbers of students casting ballots, Amherst residents last
Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to repeal laws that make it a crime to
possess marijuana and to urge local police to look the other way
rather than arrest cannabis carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the referendum has no effect on state or federal laws _
and local police promise no change in their enforcement policies _
Pfeiffer and scores of fellow hemp supporters believe their victory
is the start of a nationwide campaign that echoes the end of
Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to smoke either way,'' said Pfeiffer, who
says she began smoking marijuana when she was 10 years old. ``But
do they have to be treated like criminals? You don't see that
happening for alcohol or tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the campaign's nerve center _ a cramped room at UMass's
student union festooned with photos of Bob Marley and letters from
politicians in favor of legalizing drugs, _ about a dozen members
of the Cannabis Reform Coalition savor their victory and plot how
to spread their crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, it's not that we're promoting smoking,'' said Vern
Coffey, a 19-year-old sophomore and president of the pro-marijuana
coalition. ``It's just there are other ways to deal with this,
without making criminals out of people who otherwise obey the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a wave of other referenda, which include the
legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes in six states from
Maine to Oregon and a similar vote scheduled for this year to
decriminalize marijuana in Mendocino, Calif., the UMass students
know they face an uphill battle to change the nation's marijuana
laws.
</P>
<P>
   For a reality check, they only need to look at what local
officials have said since the referendum, where residents voted
1,659 to 981 in favor of repealing the laws.
</P>
<P>
   The town's police chief and university administrators have made
it clear: Until the Legislature or Congress changes the law,
marijuana possession will be treated as a prosecutable offense. The
last thing they want, they say, is for anyone to get the impression
it's OK to light up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing movement on campus in support of
marijuana,'' said Jo-Anne Vanin, dean of students at UMass. ``And I
can't say the level of marijuana use here doesn't concern me. But
that doesn't change our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   And even many of those who voted against repealing the marijuana
laws here, a traditionally liberal city, say they understand the
students' point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I don't think young people should be stigmatized,'' said
Hill Boss, who last week lost his seat on the town's board to a
pro-marijuana reform candidate. ``But as an elected official, I
can't tell a police officer to look the other way or what laws to
enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Amherst resident Brian McNamara, a 55-year-old father of a
14-year-old, also voted against repealing the marijuana laws, but
not without some doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very mixed feelings,'' he said while strolling downtown
last week. ``It's a shame we have kids get criminal records for
this. But, for me, it comes down to not wanting to give my son the
wrong message.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Mark Boniface, a self-described conservative Republican
senator in UMass's student government, doesn't believe marijuana is
a scourge on society. The 21-year-old senior majoring in political
science just sees it as a basic law-and-order issue. ``Asking the
police to turn a blind eye to the law is just wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What does frighten those who lost the referendum is the
reformers' improving organization.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Amherst's Citizens For a Sensible Marijuana Policy,
an umbrella group comprising local residents and students from
UMass as well as Hampshire College and Amherst College, also tried
to bring the issue before voters. But they failed by 99 votes to
get the measure on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In their no-holds-barred effort this year, using bullhorns,
phone banks, fliers, and going door-to-door passing out pamphlets,
the group got more than 3,000 signatures, far more than the
required 1,800.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 UMass students alone voted last week, according to
town estimates. In last year's board election, for example, of
2,079 voters, only 26 were students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a new consciousness for a new century,'' said Terry
Franklin, a 46-year-old local activist and spokesman for the
pro-marijuana umbrella group. ``Things like this start in college
towns. And we hope others are inspired by our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   For many students, it's not just an issue of being able to smoke
marijuana if they feel like it. They're concerned about the
fast-rising rate of marijuana-related arrests. Since 1991,
according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, the number of such
arrests has jumped by more than 400,000 to about 700,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, students are worried by a provision of the 1998 Higher
Education Act, in which Congress required financial aid be taken
away from any student convicted of a drug offense. According to the
Department of Education, many student applications for federal
loans so far this year have left one question blank _ the one
asking if they had been convicted of a drug offense.
</P>
<P>
   For UMass students intent on measuring the meaning of the
referendum, the ninth annual ``Extravaganja'' on April 29 will be a
proving ground. Typically, when students and residents gather in
the center of town and protest marijuana laws by lighting up,
several are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   This year, students in the Cannabis Reform Coalition say they
hope the police won't take action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call it a showdown,'' said Coffey, the coalition's
president. ``But we don't want it to come down to that. We want to
work with the police and have the police respect us. We'll see how
it goes.''

U.S.-EDUCATED TOLEDO APPEARS HEADED TO PRESIDENTIAL RUNOFF IN PERU 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Election is Sunday, April 9) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ When he was 7, Alejandro Toledo prowled the
cantinas of his hometown in the wee hours of the morning, wiping
the boots of drunken fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would shine their shoes. Then they would spill beer on them,
and I would have to clean them again,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Now a Harvard-trained economist, Toledo is aiming for Peru's
most illustrious job.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's presidential election, he is staging an unexpectedly
stiff challenge to President Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Fujimori appeared invincible in his
controversial push for a third five-year term. But during the last
few weeks, Toledo has rapidly moved up in the polls. And, on the
streets of Lima, there is now talk of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Although Toledo is not expected to triumph in the current
nine-candidate race, he could garner enough votes to force a runoff
with Fujimori _ a contest that, analysts say, Toledo could win.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in many years, there is a feeling that
Fujimori might lose,'' said Guillermo Loli of Apoyo, a private Lima
polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori must get more than 50 percent of the vote in order to
win in the first round and avoid a June runoff.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Apoyo poll, the president had the backing of 37
percent of the respondents, followed by Toledo with 27 percent. In
a one-on-one race, another Apoyo survey showed that the men were in
a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Some predict, however, that Toledo will falter.
</P>
<P>
   International monitors have accused the government of waging a
dirty-tricks campaign against opposition candidates and blocking
their access to the media, charges that Fujimori has denied.
</P>
<P>
   Observers also have warned that the government could attempt
election-day fraud in an attempt to ensure a first-round Fujimori
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under these conditions, it will be almost impossible for
Toledo to defeat the president, something which would no doubt
happen if there was a fair election,'' wrote columnist Fernando
Rospigliosi in the Lima magazine Caretas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Fujimori, 61, has been called Latin
America's most successful president _ and one of its most
authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1990, he has been credited with defeating the
Shining Path guerrilla movement and engineering an economic
turnaround. Re-elected by a landslide in 1995, he has spent much of
his second term concentrating powers in his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts now describe Peru's Congress as a pro-Fujimori,
rubber-stamp body, and many say meddling by the executive branch
has severely compromised the independence of the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   With the approval of both the Congress and the courts, Fujimori
managed to skirt a constitutional ban on sitting presidents running
for three consecutive terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken together, these actions suggest a systematic plan to
pave the way for an April 2000 victory for President Fujimori,''
according to a recent report by the Washington Office on Latin
America, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Toledo, 54, has overcome worse odds. He was born into a
family of subsistence farmers in the mountains of western Ancash
state. Seven of his 16 brothers and sisters died as infants.
</P>
<P>
   His family moved to the Pacific port of Chimbote, where he
worked as a shoeshine boy and sold newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo was a talented student; he won scholarships to a
prestigious high school in Peru, then to San Francisco State
University in California.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his campaign office last week in Lima, Toledo
admitted that ``there was some culture shock'' when he arrived in
California in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He said he mistook many of the long-haired men for women and was
shocked to see a couple making love in a campus fountain.
</P>
<P>
   When Toledo heard Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver speak in
Berkeley, a friend had to brief him about the civil rights movement
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Toledo adapted and went on to earn master's and doctorate
degrees at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   He studied and taught economics at Harvard and worked for the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Peru in the 1980s and ran for president in 1995.
At the time, President Fujimori was riding high after defeating the
Shining Path guerrillas and taming hyperinflation. Fujimori cruised
to a landslide re-election, and Toledo finished a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Peru's economy is stagnating.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate is at 9 percent, but 43 percent of the
work force is in the ``informal'' sector, earning money through
such pursuits as selling trinkets on street corners.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Toledo says he plans to continue the free-market
reforms initiated by Fujimori. But he also promises to pay more
attention to impoverished rural areas and create thousands of new
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He blames Fujimori for an autocratic streak that, he says, has
undermined the country's democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have strong institutions, you don't have a good
climate to attract investment,'' Toledo says. ``Fujimori's
authoritarianism is insulting. He treats Peru like it's his own
cornfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Toledo's appeal, observers say, is because of his
rags-to-riches background and his Indian features, which allow him
to connect with the poor and other mixed-race Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most of the other opposition candidates in the
presidential race are upper-class white men.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see themselves in Toledo,'' said Loli of the Apoyo
polling firm.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Toledo's late emergence in this year's campaign
echoes the 11th-hour ``Fujimori phenomenon'' of the 1990 election.
Just weeks before election day, Fujimori was a little-known
university rector who registered single digits in the polls. But as
the son of Japanese immigrants and an obvious political outsider,
he appealed to many Peruvians, who were fed up with corruption by
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round of the 1990 election, Fujimori came in a
close second to novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, who had been the
favorite. In the second-round runoff, Fujimori won the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For Toledo, a key factor has been his charisma on the campaign
trail. Until recently, opposition candidates have had trouble
getting air time on Peruvian TV, which is dominated by
pro-government stations, leaving them little choice but to
barnstorm for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the TV channels closed off, it forced the candidates to
take to the streets,'' said Juan de la Puente, an editor at the
opposition daily newspaper La Republica. ``Toledo was good at
reorganizing his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though much of Fujimori's own popularity among the poor
stems from state support of soup kitchens and other welfare
programs, the president labels Toledo an unrealistic ``populist''
who, he says, will destroy Peru's economic stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snake-oil salesmen are coming around and promising to resolve
the country's problems overnight,'' Fujimori said at a recent
campaign rally. ``But we will not permit a return to the chaos and
populism of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, critics say, Fujimori's campaign has relied
on a scorched-earth strategy designed to smear his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The effort has already undercut some of the president's
challengers, including Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade. The
pro-government media vilified Andrade for months, and he is fading
in polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toledo has benefited from the demise of his colleagues, but
now it's his turn,'' Rospigliosi wrote in Caretas.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Fujimori camp has trumpeted allegations
that Toledo fathered an illegitimate child.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case was thrown out by a judge for lack of evidence
five years ago, Fujimori's campaign is preparing TV spots to hammer
Toledo on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Crespo, a Lima resident, said he was a member of one focus
group, organized by Fujimori's campaign, that was shown a 25-minute
video featuring Toledo's purported daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the video, everyone (in the focus group) was
saying: `He's a disgrace. How can he deny his daughter? I wouldn't
vote for him,''' Crespo said. ``They are going to ruin Toledo's
image.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pro-government tabloids are full of scandalous
headlines. They claim that Toledo's wife, a Belgium-born economist
and anthropologist, is obsessed with Peruvian men and seduces them
behind her husband's back. One story said Toledo is so vain that he
believes he is singing idol Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo laughs off the onslaught and predicts that it will
backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harder they attack me, the higher I go in the polls,'' he
says.

<P>
   Now Erotica USA 2000 is bound for San Francisco, home of the
Folsom Street Fair and the Exotic Erotic Ball. And promoters of
what purports to be the nation's first sex trade and consumer show
are, frankly, worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem in San Francisco is, we consider the town so blase
about these types of things that this may not be enough to
titillate the press or create controversy. We want our name in the
paper so people know about it,'' said Fred Bari, New York insurance
dealer, sex entrepreneur and one-third partner in Erotica USA.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to oblige, Fred.
</P>
<P>
   After three sellout shows in London, the concept hit the United
States last year. For four days, New Yorkers lined up outside the
Javits Center, usually home to pharmaceutical conventions or auto
shows, to spend $30 to $150 to cruise booths full of latex wear,
sexual devices, XXX-rated videos, tattoos, and erotic art from
people like ``Chainsaw Chuck.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican candidate for
Senate in New York, called it a big mistake for a public venue _
the state-owned Javits Center _ to open its arms to
``Erotica-whatever-it-is.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the press stirred things up, ``the people at Javits called
us in and said, `What would it cost to make you go away?''' Bari
said. ``We said we're not doing anything bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in San Francisco, the fact that the show will occupy the
city-owned Bill Graham Civic Auditorium for four days, April 13-16,
is seen as rather vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for comment, Mayor Willie Brown's press secretary
Kandace Bender said: ``One of the truly spectacular things about
San Francisco is that there's always something unusual going on.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco public health workers see the show as a golden
opportunity to educate people about safe sexual practices. They
will staff a booth offering information about avoiding and treating
sexually transmitted diseases, according to Larry Meredith,
director of community health promotion and prevention for the
Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an everyday thing,'' Meredith said. ``We're at bars,
street fairs, every venue where we can get our message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Erotica USA calls itself the world's largest erotic trade and
consumer show, with 100 booths, plus lectures from some of the
usual suspects of the sex scene _ Candida Royale, a '70s porn star
who produces what she calls feminist porno; fetish diva Midori; San
Francisco sexologist Carol Queen. And porn icon Annie Sprinkle.
</P>
<P>
   Its arrival on the scene is part of the increasing mainstreaming
of the porn industry. Among exhibitors at Erotica USA in New York
were Barnes and Noble, Tower Records (which will be at the San
Francisco show, too) and a distributor for AT&AMP;T Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Internet sex sites are generating huge revenues,
unlike most other e-commerce, put porn.com on the cover of U.S.
News &AMP; World Report in March. And Playboy.com is about to become
the first X-rated Internet business that Wall Street will allow to
be traded on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how spicy Erotica USA's fare is depends on who's doing
the looking. The promoters are walking a fine line, making it sound
racy enough to pique people's interest, but not so lewd as to
discourage exhibitors or bring down official heat of any kind.
Everyone has to be 21 to get in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be girls dancing. It will be as erotic as they can
make it without being porn,'' said Erotica USA 2000 publicist Ken
Maley. ``No one will actually be having sex.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Naina Ayya, spokeswoman for SMG, the company that manages Bill
Graham Auditorium for the city of San Francisco, said nudity is
out. The company checked before renting to Erotica USA for $3,500
per day or 20 percent of the gross take.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legitimate show,'' Ayya said. ``I know they're going to
have erotic videos and publishing, but here in San Francisco it's
kind of passe. I mean it's like, what of videos?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Joe Boxer, the San Francisco underwear mogul, passed on
being a sponsor or exhibitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a pretty G-rated company. It's worked for us
for years,'' said company spokeswoman Leigh Oshirak.
</P>
<P>
   The Tom of Finland clothing maker also chose to stay away,
according to Maley.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based company, which takes its name and design
inspiration from the explicit, homoerotic drawings of an artist
known as Tom of Finland and whose Los Angeles store features an
erotic art exhibit, told Maley it was trying to become more
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Playboy had no interest in exhibiting because
the show was too tame, Maley said, but Playboy Channel will send a
reporter to cover the show.
</P>
<P>
   Bari said that although the New York show generated long lines,
the show just about broke even. Like everything these days, it's
all about the Internet _ in this case, promoting Bari and company's
Web site, which hawks sexual products.

THE GREAT TENOR   RETURNS, FIT AND OPTIMISTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, 1975, Luciano Pavarotti made his Boston debut in a
Symphony Hall recital sponsored by BankBoston Celebrity Series. At
that time, the tenor was still establishing himself in the
affections of the public. Walter Pierce, then executive director of
the Celebrity Series, recalls that the hall was only two-thirds
full.
</P>
<P>
   This week Pavarotti, for decades the most popular classical
singer in the world, returns to Symphony Hall for his first local
concert since 1993. In a recent telephone interview from his home
in Italy, Pavarotti was reassured to hear the unsurprising news
that his Boston concert, scheduled for January but postponed
because of legal obligations in Italy, had sold out immediately;
there would be no empty seats this time. ``That, I hope,'' he said,
with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The concert marks Pavarotti's 11th appearance for the Celebrity
Series. He also sang Cavaradossi in ``Tosca'' opposite Magda
Olivero, Nemorino in ``L'Elisird'Amore,'' and Riccardo in ``Un
Ballo in Maschera'' in the Hynes Auditorium on the Metropolitan
Opera tour. He appeared in a memorable Boston Pops concert, under
John Williams, that provided the climax of his one Hollywood film,
``Yes, Giorgio.'' A Three Tenors concert announced for Foxboro
Stadium was canceled after disappointing ticket sales, but
Pavarotti will join Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras again in
Albany, N.Y. in August.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Pavarotti made the formal announcement that he
would retire next season, 40 years after his debut in ``La Boheme''
on April 29, 1961. The 64-year-old singer has since exercised the
tenorial prerogative of changing his mind. ``I don't think I've
quite reached that point,'' he said. ``I don't think the voice is
spoiling, and I feel good. I enjoy singing so much and people seem
to enjoy listening to me, so I want to keep on doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenor has reason to feel good these days. For years, he had
been in great pain and stage movement had become almost impossible
for him; he sang Cavaradossi sitting down. People sometimes made
fun of his weight or confidently declared that he was losing his
voice because they didn't know what the problem really was.
Finally, in August 1998, he underwent knee and hip replacement
surgery. ``I am absolutely sorry that I did not do this before. Now
the pain is over; I suffered so much.'' Pavarotti, an expert
horseman, hasn't been on horseback since his surgery. ``I have to
take these things gradually. But this year I would like very much
to play tennis again. I will have to see.'' Right now, Pavarotti
prefers to concentrate on vocalizing. ``It is important for me to
vocalize every day.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his Met debut in 1968, Pavarotti was sure he
would never return. ``I had Hong Kong flu when I sang my first
performance at the Met _ a singer is very vulnerable to things like
this, and I had Hong Kong flu for a month. I had to cancel my
second performance of Rodolfo in `La Boheme' during the
performance, and I was thinking, `I will never be in this theater
again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Guess again
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as everyone knows, he became one of the Met's greatest
stars. Pavarotti is back in the Lincoln Center this season, where
he will participate in a gala performance with Domingo and
Carreras, each singing an act of an opera. ``I will sing an act of
`Turandot,' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me guess which one,'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed and said ``That's good.'' The whole world knows that
he would have to sing Act 3, which opens with the aria that has
become his signature, ``Nessun dorma.'' Paradoxically, although
Pavarotti has sung the aria often, he has seldom performed the
entire role of Calaf. ``I sang it three years ago at the Met; at
that time it had been 20 years since I had sung it. But the Met has
asked me to do it again, so they must have been happy. Not bad,
eh?'' Pavarotti said he would be singing ``Tosca'' and ``Aida'' at
the Met next season; he likes singing ``Aida,'' but like every
other tenor, he says, ``It would be marvelous if `Celese Aida' came
later in the opera. To walk onstage and sing that is awful because
everybody knows that aria and knows how difficult it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti, who has sung just about everything he could in the
Italian repertory, says he has no new roles in mind. ``I am not
looking, but one could still come along. There are so many roles
that I still enjoy singing.'' He continues to record. ``I would
like to make an album of songs, even some being written today.''
And he has been working on a CD of some of the literature he is
scheduled to sing in Symphony Hall _ nearly all of his operatic
roles are on disc, but his recital repertory has not been as
thoroughly documented.
</P>
<P>
   He will sing three ``early-music'' pieces by Bononcini,
Beethoven, and Scarlatti; a group of six Bellini songs; the two
arias from ``Tosca,'' eight songs by Paolo Tosti, and ``Una furtiva
lagrima'' from Donizetti's ``L'Elisir d'Amore.''
</P>
<P>
   At the piano will be his friend Leone Magiera, who was once the
husband of Mirella Freni. ``I love very much the recital singing,''
Pavarotti says. ``In the recital you are alone, in front of your
audience, with the composer and the piano; it is beautiful. Leone
Magiera is from Modena, too, and I have known him since I was 12. I
was an alto then, singing in church; my voice changed when I was
about 15. At the beginning it was a very high tenor, and when I
changed the voice, I began to imitate the movies of Mario Lanza _
not just `The Great Caruso,' but all of them. He had a fantastic
voice, not just a wonderful voice, a fantastic voice. I am a
fanatico for Mario Lanza.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce looks back
</P>
<P>
   Pierce recalls that Pavarotti's first Boston recital was
accompanied by Metropolitan Opera assistant conductor Eugene Kohn;
later his collaborative pianist was John Wustman. Several times he
appeared with orchestra; his choice of conductor was usually
Emerson Buckley, who had conducted his American debut in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time Pavarotti came the second time, a year later, he
had appeared on magazine covers,'' Pierce remembers. ``He was also
doing those ads for American Express, spouting water out of his
mouth. The second concert sold out, and so did all the others. We
did one of his concerts at the Opera House. There was some kind of
problem at the Met, a strike or the potential for a strike, so his
management called and asked if we could put on a concert fast. `How
fast?' I asked. `About a week,' they said, and we did it. We sold
it without even having to run an ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Pavarotti concert Pierce remembers in particular detail.
``We were presenting a concert on a Tuesday night in the
Metropolitan Center, which is now the Wang Center. On Friday, I got
a call asking me to come over. An engineer had declared the roof
faulty and they had to close the building immediately. We had to
look all over town, and wound up at the Hynes Auditorium, where
there was no time to put the risers in; we did it with a flat
floor. People came early with their tickets and we tried to put
them in comparable locations. Everything was going smoothly until
10 minutes to 8 _ when there was no Pavarotti. He had been looking
at horses up in Beverly all day, and had neglected to tell the
driver when to pick him up. So I jumped to my car and went to the
Ritz to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce recalls another occasion when he went to pick up
Pavarotti at the airport. ``He had lost about 80 pounds, and John
Wustman came out first. `He whispered, `You'll make a lot of points
if you tell him how much weight he lost' so I lost no time in
telling him how much better he looked. We always did well with
Pavarotti, and his presence helped the Series out a lot. And he
never canceled in Boston _ he saved that for Chicago!''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Pavarotti was here, in 1993, he sang in the Boston
Garden; the audience sat on a special floor built over the Bruins'
ice, and the tenor emerged from a kind of sultan's tent at the back
of the stage. Pierce was at the airport that time too, but his
services weren't needed. ``When he landed at the airport, the plane
opened its hatch and the cars drove out and took him straight to
the Boston Garden _ they drove up the ramp the circus used to take
the elephants in. He never once hit the ground until he walked out
to sing!''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Pavarotti's career has been thoroughly documented on CD
and video; if he didn't want to, he'd never have to subject himself
to the strain and tension of live performance again. ``But live
performance is what I love,'' Pavarotti says. ``It is always
different; you never know what is going to happen, and when it is
good, it's fantastic _ a great, great feeling.''

JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER IN COMA   AFTER STROKE; AIDE TAKES OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese politics were thrown into disarray Monday by
the news that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was in a coma after
suffering a stroke early Sunday, and was being kept alive on a
respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese learned of the gravity of Obuchi's condition early
Monday, nearly 36 hours after he was hospitalized early Sunday with
complaints of extreme fatigue. The news was delivered at a hastily
convened press conference by the prime minister's chief Cabinet
secretary, Mikio Aoki, who used the occasion to announce that he
was temporarily assuming control of the government on the prime
minister's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In a marked change from the halting and long-delayed
announcement of the prime minister's hospitalization, Monday's
events only seemed to accelerate. By late afternoon, televised
reports specified that Obuchi was breathing only with the
assistance of a respirator, that he had been given drugs to reverse
a catastrophic drop in his blood pressure and that he might not
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently he is in a coma,'' Aoki said. In a formula usually
reserved in Japan for people near death, the acting prime minister
added that Obuchi's condition was ``beyond prediction.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as other politicians issued statements of sympathy and
concern, Obuchi's uncertain prospects for recovery set Tokyo's
political class into high gear. Faction leaders within the
long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party and opposition leaders alike
moved to prepare campaigns either to succeed the prime minister
within his own party or to unseat the Liberal Democrats in upcoming
general elections.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the elections that must be called by October,
Japanese politicians had already begun intense behind-the-scenes
jockeying prior to Obuchi's stroke. For several months now, the
government has suffered dwindling popularity because of a series of
scandals involving public officials, high unemployment and a
faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   With Obuchi's resignation or removal for incapacitation now
highly likely, Japanese political analysts said Monday that the
country would almost certainly hold elections before Japan hosts a
summit meeting of the world's leading economic powers, the Group of
Eight, in July.
</P>
<P>
   Early speculation over Liberal Democratic Party candidates to
succeed Obuchi centered on Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the
party, and foreign minister Yohei Kono. Two former prime ministers
have also been prominently mentioned: Kiichi Miyazawa, Obuchi's
finance minister, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, Obuchi's immediate
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Few people Monday mentioned the possibility that Aoki would
serve as anything other than a strictly interim leader. Already, in
his 24 hours at the helm, Aoki has faced mounting criticism of his
exercise of authority, particularly of the way the public was
spoon-fed information about the crisis, beginning 21 hours after
Obuchi's hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For many, the crisis seemed to highlight the creaky nature of
Japan's rules of succession and underscore the deeply ingrained
attitude among those in power that in times of crisis the public's
right to know counts for little.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most cited examples of these weaknesses Monday was
how the prime minister's office deceived the press corps early
Sunday by announcing that Obuchi had risen at 6 a.m. and was
spending the day at his official residence.
</P>
<P>
   It was learned later that the prime minister had checked into
Juntendo University Hospital at 1 a.m. Sunday, hours before the
press briefing was given.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the war-time government announcements, deceiving
the people,'' said Atsuo Nakamura, an independent member of
parliament. ``Even 50 years later, the administration is following
the same pattern, hiding problems and putting off announcements.
All the while they are having discussions on how to advance their
own interests arising from the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   One Japanese journalist in the press corps that covers the prime
minister, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``It is no good
telling lies to the Japanese people. In this incident, their
falsehood has been revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Aoki, who has announced most of the publicly known information
about Obuchi's condition, first told the nation of a problem with
the prime minister's health only shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday. Even
then, Aoki strove to minimize the problem, telling the nation in
his four-minute-long comment that the prime minister had remained
conscious and had been driven to the hospital in a private car
rather than by ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, however, Aoki was telling a dramatically
different story of Obuchi's stroke. Looking grim-faced as he spoke
to the press, Aoki said that Obuchi had been placed on a respirator
by 9:50 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by somewhat antagonistic reporters, Aoki acknowledged
that this meant that the prime minister had already lost
consciousness well before the acting prime minister's first vague
statements to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper editorial writers have speculated that Aoki extended
the information vacuum as long as possible to favor the kind of
back-room consultation process over a new leader that defines
Japanese politics. Other critics have focused on the barely
scripted mechanism by which Aoki assumed authority, simply claiming
to have been asked to do so in an unspecified conversation with
Obuchi that apparently had no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Japan's constitution is unusually vague about what should happen
when a leader suddenly vacates power. In this instance, Aoki relied
on the so-called Cabinet law, which allows a prime minister to
personally designate his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the earlier times, when the Cabinet was formed, the prime
minister would designate an acting prime minister just in case
something happened to him,'' said Isao Sato, an emeritus professor
of law from Sophia University. ``This is not a legal name, but they
were informally called deputy prime ministers, making it clear who
was to take over.'' He added that this practice had ``become less
and less common.''
</P>
<P>
   Sato said the practice had fallen into disuse because faction
leaders in the Liberal Democratic Party resented the naming of an
official who would henceforth have an early start in the succession
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, faced with the prospect of Japan's first emergency
succession in 20 years, many politicians criticized the law's
vagueness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not based on the constitution, and it is a big problem
that two people can decide the supreme authority of the state all
by themselves, at their own discretion'' said Naoto Kan, the policy
director of the Democratic Party, Japan's leading opposition group.
``This has all occurred without witnesses.''

SEEING MARY PLAIN 
A Life of Mary McCarthy 
By Frances Kiernan. W.W. Norton. 
768 pp. Illustrated. $35. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't easy to see Mary McCarthy plain, although she directed
her leveling gaze in many directions, including her own.
</P>
<P>
   She was known for her beauty, her intelligence, her versatility,
her accomplishments, her candor, her ferocious wit, and, because
she was a woman and people love to gossip, the company she kept.
She was married four times, once to the eminent critic Edmund
Wilson, and she had several prominent lovers.
</P>
<P>
   She kissed _ and she also told, so men took her on at their own
risk, and some lived to regret that. A career contrarian and a
writer most of her life, McCarthy was an all-around woman of
letters, producing short stories, essays, theater criticism, travel
books, journalism, polemics, novels, and autobiography, genres that
frequently overlapped in her work. ``Novelistic'' detail enlivened
her journalism, polemics fueled her novels; her travel books are as
much about people as about places. And just about every word she
ever wrote was autobiographical; the one quality of a great writer
that she lacked was invention.
</P>
<P>
   In the essay, McCarthy was witty and polished with a deadly aim;
only Gore Vidal, wider-ranging, was any kind of rival at this. One
of her novels, ``The Group,'' became an international bestseller
and a movie. And William Maxwell, a great novelist who was once
McCarthy's editor at The New Yorker, believes that her short
stories and her first volume of autobiography, ``Memories of a
Catholic Girlhood'' are her finest achievement and what posterity
will value. ``The anguish beneath the highly polished surface is so
real. Nobody could fail to respond to that. If people still have
hearts, a hundred years from now they'll respond to it,'' according
to Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was notorious for her tongue as well as for her pen.
Paradoxically, this literary figure came closest to pop celebrity
not because of ``The Group'' but because of something she said
about writer Lillian Hellman on television in 1979. ``Every word
she writes is a lie, including `and' and `the.' '' Hellman slapped
a libel suit against McCarthy that ended five years later only when
Hellman died.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the end of McCarthy's own life _ she was 77 when she
died in 1989 _ her considerable achievement had been overshadowed
by what she had come to represent. She did not consider herself a
feminist and bridled at attempts to characterize her as a woman
writer. But her example meant a great deal, particularly to her
female contemporaries and their successors. She couldn't exactly be
a role model _ she started with better raw material than most
people _ but she did demonstrate to a lot of people that it was
possible for a woman to have it all, talent, a career, a child, and
at least one happy marriage, and she proved that a woman could be
as forthright and unapologetic about sexuality as men are generally
assumed to be.
</P>
<P>
   A short story involving a pessary sent this young reader to the
dictionary 40 years ago. It is gratifying to learn from Frances
Kiernan's new biography of McCarthy that the august connoisseur of
the arts Bernard Berenson was just as fascinated by the subject as
the rest of us were. When he met McCarthy in Venice, his first
question was, ``Have you brought your pessary with you?''
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan's is the fourth, largest, and best biography of
McCarthy. Kiernan saw her subject only once, in the ladies' room at
The New Yorker, where Kiernan was working as a fiction editor.
McCarthy was smoking a cigarette. ``You did not smoke in (editor)
William Shawn's office, even if you were Mary McCarthy.'' Kiernan
felt too intimidated to approach the woman she admired so much _ a
fact she later came to regret when others told her how approachable
McCarthy could be. She found much to admire in the previous
biographies of the writer, but not the human substance she was
looking for, so she set forth on her own.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's story will be familiar both in outline and detail to
those who have read her books or read around in the memoirs of the
period of nearly 60 years in which she was one of the most colorful
figures on the literary scene. Kiernan makes no attempt to match
McCarthy as a stylist, but she writes clearly and well, and she has
assembled a wealth of fresh detail, presenting the story
novelistically. Her intention is to appeal to the reader who may
not have read McCarthy's book, may even never have heard of her.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy does not escape the tragedies of life, but avoids the
kind that the great novelists, mostly men, have meted out to the
charistmatic female creatures McCarthy rivals in charisma. McCarthy
presented her own story retrospectively; Kiernan builds from the
other direction, letting the character surprise us as much as she
must sometimes have surprised herself. She gives us the appalling
childhood of the McCarthy children, orphaned and brought up by
relatives who didn't know the first thing about children. There is
the young student at Vassar, the brilliant young woman making her
way in New York. She gives detailed attention to McCarthy's
marriages, to actor Harold Johnsrud, to Wilson (McCarthy called him
``the minotaur''), to the elegant dilettante Bowden Broadwater, to
the the longest and happiest relationship, with the diplomat and
public affairs officer James West. And McCarthy's affairs and
might-have-beens are also duly documented.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiernan never forgets that the most important part of
McCarthy's day was the three hours she invariably sealed herself
off and worked. Kiernan discusses the books in an informed and
sensitive way, and she doesn't hesitate to cite McCarthy's failures
_ most notably, perhaps, the second of her Vietnam books,
``Hanoi.'' McCarthy, who headed for North Vietnam with eight
suitcases full of Chanel suits and other inappropriate attire, was
easily hoodwinked by her urbane hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Because McCarthy's best work crossed genres, Kiernan does too.
Nearly every page of her careful, chronological narrative is
interrupted and supplemented by oral history, comments from
interviews, letters, reviews, memoirs, and other sources arranged
into conversations about McCarthy. People loved to talk about
McCarthy and they still do; they also held and still hold the most
contradictory views about her. In talking about her, they are also
inevitably talking about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, one basic point. The men she knew were usually
thunderstruck by her beauty and glamor. Lionel Abel: ``Mary was
beautiful. You have no idea. A real beauty. You don't expect that
in someone so bright. That's what was so unusual about her.'' Not
everyone was equally impressed, however. The first time he saw
McCarthy, philosopher Isaiah Berlin thought ``she looked exactly
like a prostitute. Her clothes. Her shoes. Her way of dressing. Her
gait. She had these sort of open shoes with her feet showing
through and she had a particular way of walking. The skirt she
wore. It seemed to me that was exactly what those people wore. But
nobody was further from it.'' Berlin was equally opinionated about
her intellectual abilities. ``She was no good on abstract ideas.
She was fine on life in general. People. Society. People's
reactions. Character. She responded very sensitively and sharply.
Mary was a good writer, but ideas were not her thing at all. She
was a great wit, but she was not a great thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   The women she knew tended either to envy or deplore her
increasingly expensive wardrobe, to admire her appearance, or to
wonder exactly what men could possibly see in her. Susan Sontag
said, ``Mary came into the room like an aircraft carrier. She
wasn't folks. I mean, she behaved like a society matron. There was
Mary and there was a space that was cleared around her. . . . I
didn't think she was beautiful, but she was attention grabbing.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes right down to it, nobody can really agree about
anything here _ whether or not McCarthy was a good cook, for
example (she thought she was). Some of the hottest debates center
around the biggest issues, personalities and achievements in her
life. Her most important friendship was with the German refugee
writer Hannah Arendt, for example. Particularly after the
publication of her book ``Eichmann in Jerusalem,'' Arendt became a
controversial and indeed a polarizing figure. ``With Hannah Arendt
only litterateurs were taken in. Thinkers were not,'' said Berlin.
And while many of McCarthy's friends were touched by her devotion
to Arendt, others found the influence of the older woman far from
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is lively debate about her books, fueled
particularly by people who recognized themselves in her novels,
which nevertheless found strong admirers, some of them surprising.
Vladimir Nabokov, for example, wrote to Edmund Wilson about
McCarthy's novel ``The Company She Keeps'': ``It is a splendid
thing, clever, poetic and new. In fact I am quite flabbergasted. .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   The conversations about McCarthy present the kind of material
that another biographer would have evaluated, ordered, and
assimilated. At first, they can seem irritating _ isn't Kiernan
evading the biographer's responsibility to arrive at some kind of
reasoned and reasonable final assessment? But long before the end,
these artfully arranged conversations have become one of the most
engaging aspects of the book. And because a reader must make
personal judgments, the reader becomes a participant in the debate,
too. And in order to make a judgment, the reader has to turn back
to the source, McCarthy's books. There's no way to see Mary
McCarthy plain _ or anyone; and that's the point.

FILM REFLECTS WHITE YOUTHS' FACINATION WITH BLACKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a concept as old as the young Elvis, as timeless as Little
Richard's ``Long Tall Sally,'' as fashionable as the FUBU shirts
and impossibly baggy jeans on the narrow hips of suburban teens,
and as scary as square white guys bellowing ``Whaassssssup!'' like
the brothers on a Budweiser commercial.
</P>
<P>
   White folks want to be as cool as black folks.
</P>
<P>
   Deny it, denounce it, but its power can't be diminished. Asked
last year to explain the rise of rock-rap hybrids such as Limp
Bizkit and Kid Rock, MTV's Chris Connelly made perhaps the most
perceptive statement ever uttered on the cable station: ``When they
write the history of popular culture in the 20th century, they can
sum it up in one sentence which is, `White kids wanting to be as
cool as black kids.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Never has this been more apparent than in the two decades of rap
music and hip-hop culture, which have permeated everything from
language to fashion. It's almost as if the essence of urban
blackness become a salve to be bought and sold like an Enyce shirt
or a pair of Esco jeans _ white kids can't get enough of it. So
call them wiggas and wannabes, or diss them in song as the
Offspring did in their hit, ``Pretty Fly (for a White Guy),'' but
white kids losing and finding themselves in all things black, is
now _ and always will be _ the way of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what makes ``Black and White,'' James Toback's latest
drama, such a timely film. Its geographic setting is New York, but
the film really unfolds at the explosive intersection of black
hip-hop and upper-class white kids who've immersed themselves in
the culture. As with any Toback film, there are many stories here,
including a college basketball star duped into throwing a game, a
bitter undercover cop bent on revenge, a gay man bristling against
the reins of his marriage, interracial relationships, and Mike
Tyson being, well, just Mike Tyson. But at its core, the movie is
about the ramifications of nice white kids playing ghetto games,
who try to ``keep it real'' by being something other than who they
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a sense that black was authentic, and that
white was imitative,'' said Toback, the film's writer and director,
during a recent stop in Cambridge, his stomping ground during his
years at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been a reaching out _ sometimes to rip off, but
sometimes it's been sincere, imitation being the sincerest form of
flattery, where you say, `They're on to something, I have a version
of it I want to do.' In this movie,'' he said, ``I depict white
kids who are doing it with language, clothes, and a whole way of
thinking about the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The eclectic cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Brooke Shields,
New York Knicks star Allan Houston, Bijou Phillips, Claudia
Schiffer, Ben Stiller, Jared Leto, Elijah Wood, and Raekwon, Power,
and Method Man from the rap group the Wu-Tang Clan. The film opens
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural tourists
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Power plays Rich Bower, who is trying to go legit
in the music business after a life of crime. His big playa
lifestyle, with its hints of danger and nonconformity, are a
natural magnet for bored rich white kids. They're cultural tourists
walking the walk, talking the talk, even flashing the occasional
fake gold tooth. But they are way over their pretty little heads,
and Rich knows it. At one point, he asks, ``What do these people
want from us?''
</P>
<P>
   Power, whose given name is Oli Grant, has seen it all before. As
producer for the Wu-Tang Clan and founder of their Wu Wear clothing
line, he knows that many of their fans are just like the kids in
``Black and White,'' who find something they connect with,
regardless of how foreign that world may seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't against them,'' he said. ``To each his own, it's a
free country,'' he said. ``But I get mad when I see people frontin'
like they're part of it when in actuality, they're making a mockery
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The definition of ``frontin' '' could well be the scene where
the white teens, who become subjects in a documentary by
husband-and-wife filmmakers (Downey and Shields), refer to each
other as ``my nigga.'' Even though the N-word has been embraced by
some young African-Americans as a term of endearment, for others
it's simply too freighted with a history of hatred to be anything
other than a fighting word.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when it's used lightheartedly, the unofficial rule is it
can be uttered only by black folk. (For example, Eminem, the
blonde-haired, blue-eyed rap phenom, may have used every
objectionable word imaginable on his ``Slim Shady LP'' last year,
but he never came close to dropping an N-bomb.)
</P>
<P>
   But in this brave new world where hip-hop culture is youth
culture, Power said the word, depending on context, can be
acceptable coming from a white person who has their mind right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pretty much know a skinhead saying `nigger' means you're a
nigger,'' Power said. ``But there's `niggers,' then there's
`niggas,' and there's white niggas. There's `Yo, that's my nigga
right there, I love him. Like Jim (Toback) is my nigga.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Modern usage
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Toback declined to refer to Power as same. But
he did offer how that word's modern usage is similar to the way in
which football great Jim Brown, whom Toback lived with for two
years in the 1970s, used a certain 12-letter word that once got
comedian George Carlin in a heap of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a substitute for guy,'' Toback said. ``It's just a casual
thing. Besides, if you overuse a word and make it common to the
point where it's a substitute for guy, you defuse its nastiness,
defuse its power to hurt and wound you, you defuse it as a
weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   This exchange, which has enough profanity to make Lil' Kim
blush, could be a scene from Toback's movies, which have included
``Two Guys and a Girl,'' with Downey and Heather Graham, and
``Fingers'' with Harvey Keitel. He was also nominated for an
Academy Award for his screenplay for ``Bugsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Toback himself, his films are freewheeling, provocative,
and uncensored, as much beloved as they are despised. So this
strange moment in a hotel restaurant overlooking the Charles is
downright Tobackian, with the bearded 55-year-old Toback and
20-somethings Power and Bankie, of the American Cream Team, which
contributed to the film's hip-hop-heavy soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   (And speaking of albums, Power says Wu-Tang Clan, which hasn't
had an album out since 1997's ``Wu-Tang Forever,'' expects to have
its next CD out ``maybe toward the end of the summer, but before
2001. You can quote me on that.'')
</P>
<P>
   Of course for Toback, who recalls donning dashikis and wearing
an Afro when he was the only white guy hanging with Brown's posse,
there's nothing strange about it. ``Black and White'' may be
fiction, but for him it reflects pungent realities about race, sex,
and American culture in this still-new century. He wants his film,
which is sure to get tongues wagging, to create a dialogue across
racial lines, much the way hip-hop has bridged various communities
as, he said, ``a way to speak, to think, and to be.''
</P>
<P>
   While bridges and dialogues are fine, Bankie, who like many of
his rap brethren keeps an ear to the street and an eye on the
bottom line, has more practical ideas about white kids who sample
hip-hop culture.

GREATER RISK TO BLACK OFFICERS WORKING UNDERCOVER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (With sidebar, Police-Shootings)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past decade, 12 off-duty or undercover police officers
have been shot to death or wounded by other policemen after being
mistaken as felons, according to a Boston Globe survey of the
largest cities in the nation. All but two of the officers were
black.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings, which have killed five black and one white
officers and wounded one white and five blacks since 1992, are
prompting representatives of several minority police organizations
to urge their members to consider refusing undercover assignments
until adequate safety measures are in place.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings, the latest of which was the killing in January of
an off-duty Providence (R.I.) Police Department sergeant, Cornel
Young Jr., do not include possible woundings in smaller
communities, physical beatings, or events in which errant shots
were fired. But the known casualties have some police commanders
weighing whether the dangers faced by minority undercover officers,
who make up much of the first line of defense against urban crime,
are too great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nightmare of policing,'' said William J. Bratton, the
former commissioner of the New York City and the Boston police
departments. ``We rely greatly on minority officers to combat crime
this way, but in doing so we face exposing them to unintended
dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problem remains unexamined on a national level. While
several police departments have taken steps to reduce the peril,
neither the Justice Department nor the Federal Bureau of
Investigation has looked into the number of such matters, or how to
prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that this hasn't gotten more national attention
because it is a problem only waiting to reoccur and reoccur,'' said
Michael O'Connor, retired head of the New York City Transit Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent federal lack of attention means no one knows how
frequently such mistakes have occurred or why. A Globe inquiry
tracked the shootings by contacting police departments and minority
police organizations in the 20 largest cities. The FBI keeps
records on the number of police officers who die on duty, but
categorizes deaths from ``mistaken identity'' with those from
``crossfires'' and ``firearm mishaps.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau does not keep records on the number of times police
officers are wounded or assaulted because of mistaken identity, or
how often such confrontations result in shots fired errantly.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the nation's largest black police organization
contends that close calls and assaults happen far more frequently
than reflected by the 10 blacks killed or wounded since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   While the specific circumstances differ, several factors seemed
to recur in most of the shootings: The victim was a black police
officer out of uniform, and the person shooting was a white police
officer who had mistaken the black officer for a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the black officers had come upon a crime and were
trying to maintain order or make an arrest. But they were not
recognized as officers by the uniformed police who were responding
to the emergency, in confrontations tht usually lasted only
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, according to several law enforcement officials,
black and white, the reason for the mistake was racial
stereotyping: A black man with a gun, not in a police uniform, was
seen as a threat to public safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think for yourself; what does it look like when all hell is
breaking loose and there in front of you is a black man with a gun
in his hand?'' said Roger Abel, a retired New York City police
detective, who is black. ``People tend to see a criminal when they
see a black man with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Abel has written an unpublished book on the experiences of black
officers in New York. From department records, Abel has documented
28 cases since 1941 in which black police officers, while dressed
in civilian clothes, have been shot at by white officers. In four
instances, in 1941, 1969, 1972, and 1973, the black officer was
killed, Abel said.
</P>
<P>
   More black officers have been shot mistakenly in Washington D.C.
in recent years than in any other major city. Since 1995, two
District of Columbia officers have been killed and one has been
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   In the fatal case, on Feb. 7, 1995, James M. McGee Jr., 26, was
walking into a takeout restaurant with his wife and two daughters
when he saw a cabdriver being robbed. Although off duty and in
civilian clothes, McGee, a five-year veteran of the Washington
police force, pulled his gun and confronted the robbers at the same
time a patrol car came upon the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Patrolman Michael Baker, one of the two officers in the car,
drew his gun, identified himself, and hollered for McGee to drop
his weapon, according to police reports. It was nearly midnight,
and in the darkness and confusion, Baker did not recognize that
McGee, whose back was to him, was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   When McGee turned to him, Baker, fearing for his life, fired two
shots, killing McGee. An investigation cleared Baker of wrongdoing,
but the shooting sparked racial tension within the city and the
police department. McGee's father, who headed the National Alliance
of Postal and Federal Employees, asked for calm, saying he believed
that the shooting was an accident ``pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, James M. McGee Sr. remains convinced that his
son's death was an accident, but he now believes that more should
have been done to prevent such tragedies. While Washington police
have been trained to be more cautious before firing their weapons,
McGee says they should also be equipped, when off duty, with radio
equipment they could use to communicate their presence at the scene
of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that officer knew that my son was already on the scene,
something different might have happened,'' McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   District Police Chief Charles Ramsey said the city is spending
$5 million to buy radios for off-duty officers. ``If we want to get
at this problem, we've got to improve on communications and
training,'' Ramsey said. ``There's no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Transit Authority also has seen more than one
of its black undercover officers shot in the past decade. The
shootings of Derwin Pannell in 1992 and Desmond Robinson in 1994
persuaded O'Connor, the transit chief, to undertake a thorough
review. He found that there were no procedures to inform patrol
officers on how to avoid making such deadly mistakes, and no
training for undercover officers on how to respond when confronted
by a patrol officer.
</P>
<P>
   Transit officers, now part of the city's police department, are
trained to avoid face-to-face confrontations, which can easily
spiral into a deadly shootout. Instead, on arriving at the scene of
a crime in progress, they are to take cover, announce themselves as
police officers, and demand that the suspect ``freeze.'' Undercover
officers, meanwhile, must follow the orders of responding patrolmen
to the letter, even if it results in their being handcuffed and
transported to a police station for identification.
</P>
<P>
   Steps to avoid dreadful mistakes have also been taken in Boston.
In 1995, Michael A. Cox, a black officer in plainclothes, was badly
beaten by several of his white and black colleagues after he
apparently was mistaken for a fleeing suspect. Police Commissioner
Paul F. Evans later issued a set of instructions to try to prevent
such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   All patrol cars are to be informed whenever an undercover
operation is taking place in their district, and later-arriving
officers in plainclothes are always to wear special jackets with
Boston Police emblazoned front and back.

MEMOIRS OF A HAUNTED MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's foremost Holocaust survivor, a man famed for having
lifted his voice for the millions who were silenced, cannot talk
with his own sisters about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I . . . dream about my mother and my little sister,'' Elie
Wiesel writes near the end of ``And the Sea is Never Full,'' his
new book of memoirs. ``I try to learn about their last moments.
Hilda walked with them a few steps more than I did. I want to
question her about it. I don't dare. We speak every week but only
about her health, her son, Sidney, her grandchildren. Yet I would
like to know more about her experiences in the camp. . . . I curse
the reticence that renders me mute. Neither with Bea nor with Hilda
have I spoken of our parents or our home. Am I afraid of bursting
into tears?''
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel lived through the Final Solution and he lives with it
still; its shadows fall across nearly everything he has done for
the past half-century; to remember, to bear witness, has been the
constant theme of his life's work. Yet it is the one subject he
dreads. ``I have written books,'' he says, ``but with a few
exceptions, they deal with other things. . . . I have written on
diverse subjects mostly in order not to evoke the one that, for me,
has the greatest meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   He has not come close to answering the questions he began asking
as a teen-ager. How could it happen? Why was the world indifferent?
And God _ where was He? Even now he doesn't know what to call the
Nazis' genocidal war against the Jews. Sometimes he calls it the
Holocaust, sometimes ``the Tragedy,'' ``the abyss,'' ``the
Events,'' ``the Kingdom of Night;'' sometimes, simply _ ``over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth,'' he writes, ``there is no word for the ineffable.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel is one of the great men of the 20th century; the
completion of his memoirs is therefore news. His first volume,
``All Rivers Run to the Sea,'' left off in 1969. Wiesel was then
40, the yeshiva student from Sighet, Romania, who had returned from
the death camps, found his voice, and become a writer of
international repute. ``And the Sea is Never Full'' opens in
Jerusalem with his marriage and covers the 30 years since.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, they have been years of extraordinary
accomplishment. Wiesel has made his mark as an author, a teacher, a
champion of human rights, a citizen of the world. He has produced
40 books, won millions of admirers, become the confidant of
presidents, received the Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   And he has done it all while keeping one foot in Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth,'' he says, ``we have not left the Kingdom of Night.
Or rather: It refuses to let us go. It is inside us. The dead are
inside us. They observe us, guide us. They wait for us. . . . They
are judging us.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect Wiesel has on his listeners can be remarkable. In
1985, he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
the Genocide Convention. ``When I find out that Jesse Helms is
chairing the session, my instinct is to . . . head back to New
York, for this Southern senator and I clearly have few ideas in
common.'' He was not encouraged when Helms introduced him. ``I
realize that he has no idea who I am. He reads a text evidently
prepared by his aides: Everything in it sounds false, even my
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the survivor of the extermination camps began to speak.
Intently, Helms listened. In the end, he was not swayed by Wiesel's
plea that leaving the treaty unratified would amount to a betrayal
of the victims. But he paid attention, then remained ``silent for a
long moment. He then thanks me in such flattering terms that the
entire committee takes notice. Is it the first time he has heard a
Jew expressing himself as a Jew? Or is it just a display of
Southern courtesy? . . . Amazingly, at the conclusion of my
testimony, Helms interrupts the session to escort me to the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms is not the only one who finds Wiesel's voice impossible to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, New York's prestigious 92nd Street ``Y'' invited the
young author to speak. He was to share the program with the
novelist Jean Shepherd, but after she spoke, much of the audience
left.
</P>
<P>
   Recalls Wiesel: ``Never mind, I told myself, while counting the
few friends and strangers scattered through (the hall); so they
won't invite me again.'' He gave it his best shot _ read a page
from this book, discussed a passage from that one. The audience sat
in silence. ``God, make this torture come to an end,'' he silently
prayed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally it was over. ``Only it wasn't,'' he writes. In the 34
years since that night, he has returned to to lecture at the ``Y''
more than 120 times. His annual talks there and at Boston
University are typically standing-room-only affairs. Those who hear
Elie Wiesel's voice usually return to hear it again.
</P>
<P>
   In Oslo, on the night he receives the Nobel Prize, a torchlight
parade is held in his honor. From every corner of Norway, marchers
stream to pay him homage. ``Since Schweitzer,'' he overhears a
journalist say, ``there hasn't been anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still he wonders: Has it all been in vain? He fears that, ``like
Kafka's unfortunate messenger, . . . his message has been neither
received nor transmitted. Or worse _ it has been, and nothing has
changed. It has produced no effect . . . . Everything goes on as
though the messenger had forgotten the dead whose message he had
carried.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a haunting thought.

COMMON SENSE BY KERRY ON CHINA-TAIWAN TENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before American politicians have their shouting
match over a genuine 21st century issue _ trade with China _ it's
starting to look as if there may be a preliminary shouting match
over a genuine mid-20th century issue _ military help for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense this isn't so bad, for the two shouting matches are
part of a much larger issue _ the US relationship with China, which
could use mature, as opposed to partisan and ideological,
discussion. Approval of normal economic relations should follow
because fair access to China's rapidly evolving new economy is
vital to American interests, but we should probably get a few
things straight first.
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, what is going on between the Republican
congressional leaders and the Clinton administration is mostly
lousy.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of one of the adult players on Capitol Hill: ``The
debate on China today offers a false choice between a Cold
War-style containment of China and the current form of engagement
at all costs. In fact, containment of China along the lines of the
policy we pursued with the Soviet Union is neither necessary nor
prudent. Engagement is the right approach, but it must be
hard-headed and driven by our own interests.''
</P>
<P>
   As a senior Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrat and the
minority's leading Asia policy hand, John Kerry of Massachusetts is
an experienced, constructive critic. He and his like-minded
colleagues will control the center of the political action. It may
be more fun in the media to fantasize that the politics of China is
a fight between Jesse Helms on one side and commie-coddlers on the
other, but sophisticated players like Kerry are the people who
deserve our attention.
</P>
<P>
   Take Taiwan. Kerry does not see this month's exciting
presidential election as the simple selection of a
``pro-independance'' figure, Chen Shui-bian (George W. Bush, please
note), that will lead to a crisis or worse with a truculent
mainland. Instead, he notes that the three-way race didn't come
close to providing a ``clear mandate'' and that President-elect
Chen's subsequent actions indicate he understands this. He has
already offered to visit the mainland; his political party is
likely to get rid of its platform plank favoring the establishment
of an independent republic; and the Legislature has already ended a
long prohibition against economic ties between Taiwan's offshore
islands and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   China has also pulled back from most of its preelection
bellicosity, in particular, by suggesting that negotiations on
eventual reunification could proceed on a basis that resembles
equality. Kerry says China can do more, above all by recognizing
that this is no longer the late Chiang Kai-shek's one-party
``Nationalist China'' and that because of its democratic and
economic development, concepts like those applied to Hong Kong and
Macau (one China, two systems) are no longer adequate.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress, whose conservative leaders are behaving as if the
preelection posturing were still the reality, also has to behave
itself. But it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Its leaders continue, for example, to push ridiculous
legislation that would create a formal military tie to Taiwan.
Already through the House and pending in the Senate, it is,
according to Kerry, an open invitation to the conflict it seeks to
deter.
</P>
<P>
   A touchier topic is Taiwan's effort to purchase the Aegis, a
super-fancy class of antimissile and anti-aircraft destroyer, as a
response to China's military buildup and threats. Kerry's analysis,
but not yet his formal position, suggests that this is a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed narrowly, Taiwan's military needs all kinds of basic
improvements, as reports about a still-unpublished Pentagon study
make clear. That's where it needs to concentrate, not on fueling
another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, as Kerry noted, ``In the final analysis, balance
in the (Taiwan) strait is provided by us, by our willingness to
come to Taiwan's defense if China attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   That willingness was demonstrated during the crisis four years
ago, which Kerry calls one of the high points of administration
policy. But he's also correct that the immediate cause of the
crisis was administration indecision before granting a visa for a
visit here by outgoing Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's argument is that US policy must be based on more
clarity, consistency, pragmatism, and accountability. It is also
fair comment that it should not be inflated with the helium of
overblown phraseology (Clinton's short-lived ``strategic
partnership'') or endangered by silly synonyms for Cold War-style
containment (George W. Bush's ``competition'').
</P>
<P>
   In time, Kerry will be there for the administration if Congress
schedules a timely vote on trade relations. In the meantime, the
administration and the rest of us need to learn from constructive
Republican and Democratic critics like Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Left-right polemics is something else that needs to be consigned
to the last century.

STILL PURSUING THE PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of President Clinton should have ended in
February of last year, when the U.S. Senate acquitted him on
impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Or it should have ended last summer, when Congress let lapse the
Office of Independent Counsel from which Kenneth W. Starr launched
his investigation of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and Whitewater.
It definitely should have ended by October, when Starr stepped
down.
</P>
<P>
   But Congressional Republicans, who lost the impeachment battle,
and the new special prosecutor, Robert Ray, who succeeded Starr a
couple of weeks ago, apparently are determined to pursue Clinton
even after he leaves office. They expect to pursue Hillary Clinton,
too, during her senatorial campaign against New York Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   With no apparent legal need to pursue Clinton, as even Starr
noted in a recent Wall Street Journal article, these pursuits
amount to nothing more than a political vendetta against a man the
Republicans hate with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's final report on Whitewater and other investigations of the
Clintons is expected soon. It will mark the completion of a long
probe of the president. It may also become a political weapon to be
used against the Clintons, even if the reports do not call for
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ray will not make his reports public, they could be
made public by the special panel of three judges that oversees the
OIC. It is more likely to be leaks that will reach the news media
when the judges first distribute the reports to individuals named
in them for comment or rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are these reports likely to be used by Republicans in
Congress to further their vendetta against the Clintons, but they
may also be used against the man trying to succeed him, Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the new GOP-driven investigation of missing White
House e-mails that apparently weren't archived because of a
technical glitch. Republicans are using this latest issue as more
fodder against the Clintons and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Based on news reports, Ray is looking into whether his office
could charge Clinton with crimes after he leaves office.
Ironically, if Ray decides to pursue Clinton, he would be taking
that pursuit further than even Starr would.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, according to a news report, noted that the proper forum
for the charges against Clinton was the impeachment process. With
that process concluded, he said, there was no need for separate
criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But the proceedings go on, both inside and outside the special
prosecutor's office. Last week, a federal judge ruled that Clinton
violated the Privacy Act by releasing letters written to him by
Kathleen Willey, which he said he did in order to rebut her charges
of sexual misconduct. The ruling was the result of a case brought
by a conservative watchdog group, Judicial Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton released the letters, he said, to defend himself against
Willey's charges, which later began to wilt under the heat of
further public scrutiny. If Clinton had written letters to Willey,
and Willey released them to the public, it is doubtful that she
would be convicted of violating the Privacy Act, since she would
not be a target of the right-wing conservatives who are pursuing
the Clintons and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Democrats are engaged in their own scrutiny of
Republican candidate George W. Bush's fund-raising records. But
because of Clinton's impeachment history, his involvement in
Whitewater, Starr's past zeal, and the fact that the Republicans
still control Congress and its investigations, the GOP has a lot
more fodder to use against the Clintons and Gore than the Democrats
have to use against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to conduct negative campaigning against Gore and
Hillary Rodham Clinton. It is entirely another when a special
prosecutor and a judge continue to go after the president long
after a case has been settled, just to provide Republicans
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the opinion of one justice on the three-judge panel that
oversees the Independent Counsel's office should have prevailed.
Judge Richard D. Cudahy wrote in August that he thought the time
had come to end the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw no need for the office to stay in operation once
the impeachment battle was over. But he was overruled by his two
colleagues, Judges David B. Sentelle and Peter T. Fay.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress decided to let the independent counsel law expire
last June, Ray's office is supposed to be wrapping up the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it appears that Ray is intent on keeping the
investigation ongoing until he succeeds in getting an indictment
against Clinton. When Ray says, ``Nobody is above the law,'' he
apparently wants to prove his point.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it would be proper justice for Ray and federal
judges who continue to pursue Clinton to one day discover that
they, too, are not above the law.

   A. You should be in pretty good shape, but be careful. Counting
both your anticipated Social Security and your rental income, you
will need to take $36,000 a year from savings. The way I would do
that is to move toward a fixed-income portfolio of about $550,000,
completing the process by the time your current income stream ends
in early 2002.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to retire now, that would leave you with only
$135,545 that you could leave invested in stocks _ an account that
you want to leave in growth securities to protect yourself against
inflation late in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a great deal of money for that chore, but there are a
couple of factors in your favor: You can continue saving for 22
months, and your retirement accounts should continue growing. You
don't specify how much you have been contributing to your various
accounts, but whatever it is, I suggest you pick up the pace. But
even if you were not to contribute more, internal growth would add
a further $93,606 to the accumulation, if you earned a portfolio
average of 7 percent total returns during the next 22 months.
</P>
<P>
   I use that relatively low 7 percent figure for a couple of
reasons. One is my chronic caution about the current stock market,
and the second is that I suggest you immediately begin transferring
money to fixed-income assets. Since you already have that $100,000
in the cash balance account, you would need to move only about
$19,250 a month to the fixed-income side to build the fixed-income
account by February 2002.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't try anything fancy, looking to a three-legged
fixed-income portfolio with about half in intermediate-term
government guaranteed securities, such as US Treasury securities, a
GNMA fund, or a general government bond fund. I'd then have about a
quarter in CDs, money markets, or short-term bond accounts, and the
final quarter in a high-yield bond fund, such as Fidelity Capital
and Income or Vanguard High-Yield Corporate.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that's likely to improve the odds that this plan will
work is adjusting yourself to that $60,000-a-year budget as soon as
you retire. Then, treat the extra $24,500 in annual income for the
next 22 months as money that can be added, in toto, to your
retirement savings. The trick will be to see how much you can build
the stock end of the portfolio during that period, so it will serve
the eventual purpose of protecting you from inflation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I need information about rolling over pension and 401(k)
accounts after a job change and maximizing the value of my
retirement savings. I believe it is best to roll over the pension
account, but the 401(k) account is different. I could leave it
where it is, and they invest the money for me. I am not sure of the
fees associated with having an individual account compared to a
group account such as the 401(k). I believe my ability to
reallocate my money among the funds available in the 401(k) is no
longer an option since leaving the company. But when moving my
accounts I want to be able to do minimal maintenance. Considering
that I have 30 years to go, I can't let my funds stay in this ratio
forever _ or can I? My gut feeling is I should roll over to an IRA
so I can do an annual review and let the fund manager do the rest.
</P>
<P>
   I have just purchased a house, which is quickly absorbing my
extra cash. I thought it was time to stop living like a college
student and start buying things like furniture. I'll wait until
January to resume retirement savings, at which point I will be
eligible for my new employer's 401(k) plan and company match.
</P>
<P>
   B.V., Plymouth, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The question of whether to roll over the pension is simple.
If you take the lump sum as a rollover IRA and invest it for 30
years and achieve 10 percent average annual returns, you will build
a pool of $424,153 _ probably sufficient to produce an income
stream of $2,297 a month without invading the principal.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 401(k), I agree with your gut feeling. If rolling the
401(k) money over into an IRA is the only way to change the
investment allocations, I'd take that course _ if only to get rid
of that 19 percent of the account that is loafing in an interest
account _ even though you are young enough so that projecting
growth out for 35 years provides some pretty spectacular numbers.
For example, with no additions the 401(k) would hit $1,903,991
after 30 years with 10 percent average growth.
</P>
<P>
   But once you factor in inflation, you'll understand how
dangerous it is to let money loaf. If we combine the rolled-over
pension and the 401(k) after 30 years, the impressive sum would be
$2,328,144. But then you have to work the other side of the
equation _ inflation again _ and when you do, you come out with the
buying power of about $830,000 in today's dollars. That presumes an
average 3.5 percent inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   Given your strong start on retirement savings, I see no problem
with taking a year off while you wait for 401(k) eligibility. But I
will caution you not to get too comfortable living on your full
income.
</P>
<P>
   As for the costs of a rollover into an IRA, either with Fidelity
or Vanguard, both offer an impressive array of no-load funds, and
no charge for the rollover; the odds are that total management
costs would be lower after the rollover.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The Independent Advisor for Vanguard Funds is one of my
favorite newsletters. It appears monthly, usually in a 12-page
format. In addition to a general overview of market activities and
particularly their effect on Vanguard offerings, among other
features, the newsletter provides statistical reports on all of
Vanguard's retail funds, four model portfolios, notices of likely
upcoming distributions from the various funds, and interviews with
various Vanguard managers.
</P>
<P>
   The model portfolios have excellent track records. Examples,
with results from the inception of the models at the start of 1991,
are the growth portfolio, beginning at $50,000 and standing at
$242,902 at the end of January; the conservative growth portfolio,
moving from the same starting point to $185,000; and the income
portfolio, which grew from the same base to $164,912. In the final
case, the accumulation is probably academic, since the models
presume that all distributions are reinvested, which is not what
income investors typically do.

CASH AND CARRY: CLUES TO PERSONALITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the wallet, or lack of one. How people carry their cash
is a psychological profile of sorts, and the amateur shrinks are
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Is the wallet fat, bulging with coupons, receipts, photos,
insurance and club membership cards, not to mention an entire
checkbook? Then it probably belongs to a married woman with a tight
grip on the family finances, says Jim Leiwakabessy, assistant
manager for The Sharper Image in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a control issue,'' he says. ``She wants the balance with
her at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   His store's slim, small wallets, with slots for no more than a
couple of credit cards, sell mostly to men, or to young single
women who want to travel unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinner the better,'' says Leiwakabessy, describing not
only the leather, but the fashion-conscious customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone in the family is going to carry the health cards
for the kids, it will be the woman,'' says Rick Gebhardt, assistant
manager for Bally. ``Men carry nothing for the children, and they
don't like adding up numbers. Women are the money managers.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder civilization's first wallets, invented during the
Middle Ages, were strictly a female item _ cloth bags called
``pockets'' that hung from a cord tied around the waist under the
skirt. A trade group, Luggage and Leather Goods Manufacturers of
America, reports that the ``pocket'' evolved into a flat,
rectangular unisex ``pocketbook,'' made of linen in the 1700s and
later done in leather.
</P>
<P>
   Today's money-gear emporiums can offer as many as 40 wallet
styles that sell for anywhere from $35 to nearly $400, depending on
the type of leather, clasps, zippers, and compartments.
</P>
<P>
   For the status-seeker, choosing one can assume the importance of
buying a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me, `I make $100,000 a year, so I don't buy Coach
anymore,' '' whispers a clerk in a Coach store that would seem to
be the definition of class, with its elegant display cases and
smartly dressed staff. ``They want Gucci because it's got that G on
the front. Coach is subtle and puts the name inside.''
</P>
<P>
   A Brookstone clerk, noting that money clips are hot, adds that
his store's tasteful silver model was not quite flashy enough for
him _ he carries a big gold one purchased at Neiman Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of cash out there in a lot of money clips,''
says Bruno Marini, general manager of the restaurant Ambrosia on
Huntington. ``People take out the money clip and tip the coat
person and the valet. It's a show of prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the color of money _ or, more accurately, the color of the
wallet carrying the money _ which is moving way beyond basic black
and brown to blast old-Boston sensibilities with coral, pumpkin,
red, canary yellow, jungle animal fabric prints, and polka dots.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can afford to buy a $310 wallet in lime green, you're
telling people you have disposable income,'' says Nunzio
Bellofatto, of the leather mecca Bottega Veneta.
</P>
<P>
   But Bellofatto also sees people who simply stuff their money
into their pockets in a wad. One customer wraps it in a thick
rubber band. ``A police officer once told him that he'd feel a
pickpocket taking his money if he carried it like that,'' he says.
``He comes in to buy wallets for his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The rubber band's casual chic also appeals to Lydia Shire, owner
and chef of Biba and Pignoli restaurants. ``I had a wallet once,''
she says. ``It didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Shire slaps the rubber band around her bills and tosses the
bundle into her purse, where ``it floats'' and she can grab it
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate developer Ron Druker is another rubber band man and
finds everything else ``too cumbersome.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this quest for streamlining in the age of overpriced
accessories is what inspires some Filene's customers to carry cash
in the tops of their knee-high stockings or to keep credit cards in
a zip-lock plastic bag. At Shreve Crump &AMP; Low Co., clerks have seen
the occasional customer walk in with money in a paper bag.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's basic, and a refreshing break in the opulence that
has become the currency of Boston. Could it be a trend? Maybe, as
long as nobody shops in the rain.

CAPTURING THE SPIRIT OF PYM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday morning, in a Harvard University Law School lecture
hall, 80-odd people stood to sing ``All Things Bright and
Beautiful'' in Barbara Pym's honor as Father Gabriel Myers, a
Benedictine monk, played a portable keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment both touching and funny, ``rich material,'' Pym
might have described it. It came near the start of the second
annual meeting of the Barbara Pym Society of North America, after
Father Myers, choirmaster and organist at St. Anselm's Abbey in
Washington, D.C., had spoken about Victorian hymns in the author's
novels.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Miller, director of publications at Harvard Law School,
started the American group as an adjunct to the British society
based at Pym's college, St. Hilda's, Oxford. Scholars and fans came
to the conference from all over the United States and Canada, from
Britain and Austria. There were many returnees, and new faces too,
some of them encouragingly young. A Web site has stirred interest
in the author and her work. The publisher Moyer Bell is reissuing
her novels. She is the subject of academic research. Miller and
Frauke Lenckos are coeditors of a collection of essays, ``Reading
Barbara Pym,'' for which they hope to find a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Pym, who died in 1980, had more than her share of problems with
publishers during her lifetime. Her novels still remain relatively
unknown, which is a shame. She writes with subtle irony about human
nature, its infinite capacity to irritate and bore, to delight and
surprise. Her readers talk about ``Barbara Pym moments'' in their
own lives, situations that remind them of passages in the novels.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Ackley, professor of English at the University of
Wisconsin, noted that Pym wrote about single women in a way that
had never been done before. Her work isn't exactly ``Bridget
Jones,'' but some of her themes are similar, notably ``the
impossibility of men,'' as one of Pym's characters puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Ackley spoke about the importance of literature in Pym's novels.
Her characters are forever reading, quoting or misquoting favorite
lines from books and poems, being influenced by what they read.
Pym's novels and diaries, Ackley said, suggest that literature has
enormous power to give comfort, provide consolation, help people
connect with one another, liberate the spirit, and ultimately make
readers more compassionate human beings.
</P>
<P>
   As her readers know, Pym herself was comforted, inspired, and
entertained by many writers, notably Jane Austen, Henry James, and
various greater and lesser English poets. Nancy Ellen Talburt,
associate vice chancellor and professor of English at the
University of Arkansas, revealed that Pym also liked the mysteries
of Dorothy Sayers and Josephine Tey, and the work of American
writer Alison Lurie.
</P>
<P>
   Talburt wrote a fan letter to Pym that led to a lunch with the
author at an Oxford hotel in 1979. As the only person at the
conference who had met Pym, Talburt was questioned intently after
her talk. What did Pym drink? Gin and tonic. What did she wear? A
white cotton blouse and a bright blue skirt. Did she talk about her
friend Philip Larkin, the poet? Only to say that having a
conversation with him was frustrating because he was both shy and
rather deaf, ``a difficult combination.'' Finally someone asked
about fairy cakes, a type of pastry that figures in Pym's novels.
What are they? It was agreed that they're a kind of sponge cake.
The question of whether an authentic fairy cake has pastry
``wings'' was earnestly debated but remained unresolved. It might
have been a Barbara Pym moment. Perhaps someone will provide an
answer to the fairy cake questions at next year's meeting.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
 
!! 1/2 ``Onegin'' This snowy adaptation of Alexander Pushkin's
verse novel ``Eugene Onegin'' is gorgeously filmed, hypnotically
told, and seriously flawed by the miscasting of Liv Tyler. She
doesn't mix convincingly with Ralph Fiennes, who is perfect as the
conceited aristocrat who rejects her, then falls in love with her.
The period piece is the confident directorial debut of
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fiennes's sister, Martha Fiennes. (Unrated) (Matthew Gilbert) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``Price of Glory'' Seeming more rigged than any fixed fight,
this boxing movie is KO'd by predictability and a too-simplistic
take on a Latino family. Jimmy Smits plays the father who doesn't
know best as he pushes his sons into the boxing career he never
had. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``The Road to El Dorado'' Animated Spanish rascals go for
New World gold. It's OK, but no more than OK. More efficient than
inspired, its nouveau-Disney house style seems standard-issue.
Except for a Mayan scamster voiced by Rosie Perez, it plays like
``Ishtar'' with computer graphics. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! 1/2 ``The Skulls'' This would-be expose of the sinister
power-mongering of a secret society at Yale declines into a
ludicrous exercise in frat-house gothic, populated by paper-thin
characters. Instead of a conspiracy thriller, it's ``Animal House''
with better clothes and pricier real estate. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``The Terrorist'' One of the few looks at a political assassin
that isn't about explosions or sensory jolts. Thoughtfully and
originally, Indian filmmaker Santosh Sivan focuses on what's going
on behind the huge eyes of Ayesha Dharkar's 19-year-old ``human
bomb'' awaiting her target in Sri Lanka. (Unrated)

`BETWEEN THE LIONS' AIMS TO LURE KIDS INTO THE LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With TV-Lions-Review)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the two years Judith Stoia spent developing a PBS
children's program titled ``Between the Lions,'' one of her
collaborators, Christopher Cerf, periodically opined that ``every
good idea begins with a bad pun.''
</P>
<P>
   The pun may be a groaner, all right, but it accurately reflects
the spirit _ and the atypical ambitions _ of the sprightly new
show, which debuts this week.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a library where books come alive, ``Between the Lions''
draws its title from the fact that libraries are often bracketed by
stone lions, which you have to walk between to enter. Getting kids
to walk ``between the lions'' and into their local libraries is the
program's long-term goal. Its short-term goal is to equip children
ages 4 to 7 with reading skills by blending puppetry, animation,
and live action in a series of songs and sketches that teach
vocabulary and sentence structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we want it to be entertaining,'' said Stoia, the
program's executive producer. ``But the real purpose of this is to
help kids learn to read.''
</P>
<P>
   But with television so often blamed for the national decline of
literacy, isn't it paradoxical, even presumptuous, for a TV program
to aspire to teach reading? Stoia doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is actually very well-suited for teaching
reading,'' she said. ``We can do certain things it's hard for a
teacher to do. We can show a page of a book and make all the A's on
the page animate and wiggle. Or we can change all of the A's to
E's.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Sesame Street'' famously introduces children to letters
and numbers, and programs like ``Reading Rainbow'' and ``Wishbone''
try to open up the world of books to children, ``Between the
Lions'' goes further in focusing on the creation of a ``literacy
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the Lions,'' coproduced by WGBH and Sirius Thinking
Ltd., is built around a curriculum devised by reading experts.
``They explained what the challenges were for kids in decoding the
English language, with short vowel sounds, for instance, and word
blending,'' said Stoia. ``They explained the concept to us and we
came up with different ways to achieve it. Our advisers look at
every script; this is very pointed in terms of teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoia says you'd have to go back to ``The Electric Company''
(1971-76) to find a children's TV program tied so inextricably to a
literacy curriculum. The overall thrust of ``Lions,'' in her view,
``very much matches what kindergarten and first- and second-grade
teachers are trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   No less an authority than Peggy Charren agrees. Charren, who ran
children's book fairs before founding Action for Children's
Television, said she believes the show's creators have struck the
right balance between entertainment and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting kids to be wild about reading is the most important
education you can do,'' said Charren. ``But you have to get the
kids to watch the program. They did that without sacrificing
education.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stoia, ``Between the Lions'' is a new chapter in a varied
and Emmy-winning television career. She worked as a reporter and
managing editor of nightly newscasts at WGBH, Channel 2 in Boston,
from 1974 to 1979 before joining WCVB-TV, Channel 5, where she
cofounded ``Chronicle'' and served as the program's executive
producer. By 1990, she had returned to Channel 2, where she
produced documentaries and was head of local programming.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Stoia left that post to develop ``Between the
Lions,'' commuting between her home in Boston and New York City.
New challenges, such as working with puppets for the first time,
were ameliorated by her production team, which included heavy
hitters like ``Sesame Street'' veterans Cerf (who also cofounded
the National Lampoon), Michael K. Frith, and Norman Stiles.
</P>
<P>
   PBS seems to have high hopes for ``Between the Lions.'' On
Channel 2, which has an obvious interest in its success, it will
air twice a day, at 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., pushing ``Barney &AMP;
Friends'' to 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   There will be an ``educational outreach'' effort, involving such
groups as the American Library Association and the National
Coalition for Literacy, and a Web site featuring ``reading
activities'' at www.pbskids.org/lions.
</P>
<P>
   Stoia said she hopes the young viewers of ``Between the Lions''
will take the logical next step: getting a library card. ``Besides
teaching reading skills, the program honors books and reading,''
she said. ``It really celebrates reading.''

THE STORY OF A SONG THAT CHANGED THE WORLD

STRANGE FRUIT 
Billie Holiday, Cafe Society, and an Early Cry for Civil Rights 
By David Margolick 
Running Press, 160 pp., $16.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the history of popular music, there is nothing comparable to
``Strange Fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither jazz nor blues, its music is stark and funereal. Its
three verses, comprising 12 lines, are unaccompanied by a chorus.
Raw, mournful, and accusing, it is a lament that bears witness to
horror. And, sung with a world-weary ache by the great Billie
Holiday, it amplified the anguished cry of all those whose lives
ended at the wrong end of a rope:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southern trees bear strange fruit,
</P>
<P>
   Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
</P>
<P>
   Black body swinging in the Southern breeze,
</P>
<P>
   Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one years since Holiday first sang those words, they still
disturb the soul. It became Holiday's signature song, yet because
of its subject matter, it has long been regarded as too disturbing
for audiences, black or white.
</P>
<P>
   David Margolick's exceptional book, ``Strange Fruit,'' is a
biography of an extraordinary work, the singer who made it famous,
and its sustaining impact as one of the great protest songs of the
20th century. A contributing editor at Vanity Fair, Margolick
parses fact from fiction, unearthing the song's history from its
beginnings as a poem to its recent recognition by a British
magazine as one of the ``10 songs that actually changed the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Margolick debunks the most common myths about the song _
chiefly, that Holiday co-wrote it, or had it written for her, a
claim Holiday herself perpetuated. In truth, ``Strange Fruit'' was
written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher in New York, who
was also a political activist and composer. (If his name sounds
familiar, it's probably because in later years he adopted the sons
of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg after the parents were executed.)
Under the name Lewis Allen, Meeropol wrote the song in the 1930s,
at a time when lynchings were common. By one conservative estimate,
there were 3,833 reported lynchings between 1889 and 1940; most
occured in the South, and the vast majority of victims were
African-American men, women, even children.
</P>
<P>
   The song was performed regularly in leftist circles, where it
was discovered by Robert Gordon, director of the floor show at Cafe
Society, an ultra-liberal, fully integrated New York nightspot
where Holiday, then 24, was the featured artist.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon brought the song to the club's owner, Barney Josephson,
who introduced the tune to Holiday. Although some remembered
Holiday as initially indifferent to the song, Margolick maintains
she did not overlook its searing message, and soon ``laid claim to
the song, telling audiences it has been written especially for her,
and resenting anyone who dared sing it.'' One who dared was
folk-bluesman Josh White, who performed the song even after Holiday
threatened to cut his throat.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday was so particular about the song, she wasn't beyond
evicting or attacking patrons who responded inappropriately
interrupted her rendition. It was that kind of song, Margolick
asserts, and he perfectly re-creates Josephson's elaborate staging
for the song, which would usually close Holiday's set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before she began, all service stopped. Waiters, cashiers,
busboys were all immobilized. The room went completely dark, save
for a pin spot on Holiday's face. When she was finished, the lights
went out, and she was to walk off the stage, and no matter how
thunderous the ovation, she was never to return for a a bow.'' It
would usually take audiences a few moments to gather themselves
emotionally before they could applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the song's blatant politics were as reviled as
revered. Some radio stations wouldn't play it; Holiday's own label,
Columbia, refused to record it (Holiday found another company to
make the first recording). The song was even rejected as too
depressing by civil rights protesters, who preferred more uplifting
fare like ``We Shall Overcome'' or ``This Little Light of Mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of a life addled by drink, drugs, and too many
bad men, Holiday sang ``Strange Fruit'' less and less. It simply
took too much out of her. She cried every time she sang the song,
and as Margolick writes, ``she was too busy holding herself
together to wage crusades for anybody else.'' Years later, others
would perform the song, including Nina Simone, Cassandra Wilson,
Sting, and Tori Amos, but Holiday's version remains the standard.
And she so embodied the song, one can understand how, with all due
respect to Meeropol, she claimed its authorship.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Time designated ``Strange Fruit'' the ``Best Song of
the Century.'' With reportorial finesse, Margolick also restores
``Strange Fruit'' to its deserved stature in the public
consciousness as a piece of shocking reportage _ a dispatch from
battlefields where the price of racism and ignorance was tallied in
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans of the song do not say they like it _ how can one
actually like a song on such a subject? _ but they acknowledge its
lasting impact,'' Margolick writes. ``They credit it with helping
awaken them to the realities of racial prejudice and the
ameliorative power of art. Whether they protested in Selma or took
part in the March on Washington or spent their lives as social
activists, many say it was hearing `Strange Fruit' that triggered
the process.''

   NEW RELEASES: ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' _
Filmmaker George Lucas is releasing this prequel to the ``Star
Wars'' trilogy on VHS, so DVD fans won't get many of the extras
that would make this more an event than just a release. It's worth
saying again: ``Star Wars,'' one of the most successful films of
all time, was such a huge hit because it took everyone by surprise.
``Menace'' fills in the story but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' _ Perhaps in more artistic hands, the
supernatural conceit for this popular movie might work. Unlike
``The Shining,'' which has a series of subtexts, this ghost story
simply rides along on an unconvincing surface. If everyone were as
good as Haley Joel Osment, who's chillingly convincing, it would be
a much better movie. Bruce Willis, given his best role since ``Pulp
Fiction,'' almost pulls it off.

 BRINGING THE STAGE TO THE SMALL SCREEN
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Television and the performing arts have never been a great fit
in America. From television's inception to the coming of cable,
prophets promised a window on the arts that would transform the
masses. Instead, the masses transformed television: The golden age
of drama lasted little more than 10 years as more channels meant an
even greater competition for ratings. On cable, the Arts &AMP;
Entertainment network became strictly Entertainment, and Bravo has
turned to mostly movies. Even PBS gives short shrift to the
performing arts these days, except for opera.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the bleak scenario for the arts on television _
particularly for theater, which has been relegated to a handful of
programs on ``Great Performances'' and ``Live From Lincoln Center''
each year _ is beginning to improve. Whether we're on the verge of
a new golden age of the arts on television or merely waiting for
the next unfulfilled promise remains to be seen, but the prospects
look promising.
</P>
<P>
   Think about the incredibly successful marriage of television and
sports. The adage in football, for example, was that television put
you on the 50-yard line _ but that's actually misleading.
Television was always able to seat the viewer in the fifth row
center, say, for arts programming, but it was rarely able to
simulate the experience of attending the live event the way that
sports programming has always been able to do, even in black and
white. Sports programming was able to take you to the key vantage
point on every play, while also capturing something of the feel of
being at the park.
</P>
<P>
   Now TVs are getting big enough, the sound is getting strong
enough, and the picture is getting sharp enough that the same thing
is starting to happen on television, particularly with the advent
of digital picture and sound. Two broadcasts earlier this year,
``Death of a Salesman'' on Showtime and Anne-Sophie Mutter's
appearance with the New York Philharmonic on PBS, showed that
television may have come alive as a partner for the arts. Both were
riveting broadcasts, ``Salesman'' as tension-filled in its way as
this year's Super Bowl was for sports fans. For those who like
20th-century music, and even for some who don't, Mutter's
performances were as dramatic as an episode of ``The Sopranos'' _
and we're not just talking about her strapless gown.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs, not so coincidentally, were directed by Kirk
Browning, who is hardly a young maverick when it comes to directing
arts programming for television _ next year will mark his seventh
decade in the business. He started at NBC in 1948 with three
cameras per performance. The technology at his end of the
transmission has improved just as it has at the viewer's. He had 9
cameras at his disposal for ``Death of a Salesman'' and 11 for
Mutter and the Philharmonic on ``Live From Lincoln Center.''
Additionally, according to Browning, the equipment is not as
intrusive as it used to be _ the audience hardly knows the cameras
are there.
</P>
<P>
   What television offers
</P>
<P>
   It may be heresy to say that these broadcasts were as good or _
shudder _ better than being there, but consider some of the
advantages. Brian Dennehy's performance as Willy Loman seemed less
fussy on television, and the camera didn't dilute the strength of
his delivery or that of any of the other actors, notably Elizabeth
Franz's as his wife, Linda. At a classical performance your vision
of a performer is fixed _ one angle is all you get. With the
Philharmonic concert, Browning was all over the stage, presenting
Mutter, conductor Kurt Masur, and the other artists from a variety
of angles. And the sound on both, with the TV hooked up to stereo
components, was terrific.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the broadcasts were far less static than similar
programs 10 or even 5 years ago. ``You never used to be able to
light in a way that would allow you to penetrate with as many
close-ups,'' said Browning in a telephone interview. ``The lenses _
by the time you punched in to a close-up, the picture was so dark
you couldn't take it. Now you can get a great amount of detail. A
lot of people think I do too much detail. I'm a little busier than
some people in this business, but something that I've decided over
the years is that the viewer is looking for is specifics. The
medium calls for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Salesman'' wasn't exactly a live broadcast: It was taped
before an audience just after the play had ended its Broadway run.
``It was a tough show because the production didn't lend itself to
the camera. The turntable was a theatrical artifice we couln't
handle on camera. I think that the most problematic thing is to put
live theater on television. Somehow it works better in dance and
opera because of the larger-than-life aspect that the audience
understands, but in theater you lose the sense of audience and you
say, `Why are they screaming at each other?' I hope you had the
sense with `Salesman' that it was in front of an audience so you
didn't lose that chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Living-room drama
</P>
<P>
   William Cosel, executive producer for WGBH's ``Evening at
Pops,'' says that both he and Browning use lipstick cameras (so
named because they are about the size of a lipstick holder), and
can go where cameras could never go before. Cosel shot the
reopening of Severance Hall in Cleveland recently, and the
Cleveland Orchestra's artistic director, Christoph von Dohnanyi,
challenged him to go even further and use the technology of sports
events to add text and split screens. Both Cosel and Browning are
increasingly able to make the pace and the image correspond to the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Television is about to take on theater again in a major way.
Broadway Television Network is poised to offer a dozen live
telecasts on a pay-per-view basis in the next five years, beginning
with ``Smokey Joe's Cafe.'' Its closing performance was taped
before a live audience. Subsequent shows will be aired live for a
fee of about $35 and then make their way to cable and home video.
In another venture, former HBO chairman Michael Fuchs has joined
with some theater people to restore such television classics as the
Lee J. Cobb ``Death of a Salesman'' and the Jason Robards-Colleen
Dewhurst ``Moon for the Misbegotten'' for broadcast and/or home
video.
</P>
<P>
   PBS will be getting back into theater with ``Stage on Screen,''
producing for television recent plays such as A. R. Gurney's ``Far
East'' and Anna Deavere Smith's ``Twilight: Los Angeles'';
broadcasting films made from plays, including Jon Robin Baitz's
``Substance of Fire''; and digging back into the archives of WNET,
New York's major public television station. WNET, however, will be
reshooting these new productions for television. ``Far East,'' for
example, will go from its one set and seven actors onstage to 16
sets and 50 actors on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Bill O'Donnell, manager of program develepment for culture and
arts programming at WNET, says that even though there have been
significant strides made in shooting before an audience, there is
still a feeling that the actors are under glass. ``We want to keep
the theatrical flavor in terms of lighting and camera movement, but
television and film are so literal that we'll take each on a
case-by-case basis and decide what best suits each project in
trying to re-create what comes across best in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to gauge how successful WNET will be from Wednesday's
``Joseph and the Amazing Tchnicolor Dreamcoat'' (8 to 10 p.m.,
Channel 2) on ``Great Performances.'' Like the ``Cats'' video, this
is a more European approach, with heavily stylized camerawork and
Donny Osmond, Joan Collins, and the rest of the cast mugging
directly into the camera while lip-synching the lyrics, a la the
late Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's opera telecasts. As with Ponnelle's
operas, there's something to be said for this approach, which works
with Andrew Lloyd Webber, but who knows what the results would be
with less trivial material?
</P>
<P>
   Webber or not
</P>
<P>
   ``Joseph,'' which was produced by Lloyd Webber's company, not
PBS, is more or less an infomercial for the recently released home
video of the musical. ``Great Performances'' seems infatuated with
Lloyd Webber, this being the fourth presentation of his ouevre _
``Jesus Christ Superstar'' will be number five. Leaving aside for
the moment whether hitching one's star to Lloyd Webber's wagon
represents a massive dumbing down for PBS, pursuing a radical
remaking of the arts for television may be the wrong approach in
light of Browning's recent successes with live or live-on-tape
broadcasts. (Last week's ``Tosca'' was another production by
Browning, who says that last year's ``Twelfth Night'' with Helen
Hunt was the best of all his theatrical broadcasts.)
</P>
<P>
   The production of an artistic event is hardly cheap _ about
$700,000 and reshooting something for television can be twice as
expensive. But with the recent improvements in both hardware and
software, PBS could be primed to chart the artistic life of the
country the way that ABC's Roone Arledge and the networks have been
able to chart the athletic life of the country for the past 50
years. PBS could now be that window on the artistic world observers
always hoped television would be. Given the complaint that public
broadcasting has grown redundant in the current television
landscape, to waste its time on piffle like ``Joseph'' would be
nothing less than a tragedy for PBS and the country.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, instead, going from the reopening of Severance Hall one
week to ``James Joyce's The Dead'' on Broadway to the American
Ballet Theatre's production of ``Le Corsaire'' to Pierre Boulez's
residency at Carnegie Hall to a new Don DeLillo play at the
American Repertory Theatre or Steppenwolf from week to week. That
would truly be a new golden age _ for PBS, television, and the arts
in America.

`LIONS' ROARS TO LIFE WITH IMAGINATIVE SKITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With TV-Lions)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BETWEEN THE LIONS 
Produced by: WGBH Boston and Sirius Thinking, Ltd. 
Executive producer: Judith Stoia 
When: Weekdays at 8:30 a.m. and at 4:30 p.m. 
On: PBS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the incessant yelping of ``Barney'' and the noxious baby
talk of ``Teletubbies'' chipping away at its reputation, the Public
Broadcasting Service badly needs a top-notch new children's
program.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, it has one. ``Between the Lions,'' an
imaginative and high-spirited series that debuts at 8:30 a.m., is
the best addition to the PBS kids' schedule since ``Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its innovations _ and there are many _ ``Between the
Lions'' is a throwback show of sorts. Its spirit is that of the
old, idealistic PBS, when a program's educational mission
outweighed its marketing and merchandising possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Using stories, poems, and snappy original songs, ``Between the
Lions'' focuses with refreshing directness on a goal that may never
have been more challenging and more necessary: teaching youngsters
to read, and, more, to love the act of reading. Obviously, that
duty falls primarily to parents and teachers, but they will find
this program (unlike much else on TV) an energizing ally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lions,'' coproduced by Boston's WGBH, is set in a library
presided over by Theo and Cleo, leonine puppets who like to read
fables to their two cubs, Lionel and Leona. (This being a very
21st-century library, a computer mouse named Click is also on
hand.) Through a mixture of animation and live action, the books
come to life, pulling the lions into their story lines. The stories
are interwoven with skits that impart lessons about spelling,
vocabulary, phonics, and the sheer fun of wordplay.
</P>
<P>
   The ambition of ``Lions'' is suggested by today's segment,
``Pecos Bill Cleans Up the West.'' At first, it merely teaches
sight reading during a bouncy animated sequence based on the folk
tale about the cowboy who tamed a tornado. But it goes further
when, in an eye-popping sequence, the storybook hero emerges from
the pages of a book riding a twister that tears through the
library. In terms children can understand, the segment explores the
difference between fiction and reality.
</P>
<P>
   As on ``Sesame Street,'' the producers have salted ``Lions''
with punningly named characters (Tammy Lionette, Tiger Words, Arty
Smartypants) to keep the grown-ups diverted as they watch with
their kids. The expressive lion puppets are joined by a supporting
cast that includes Martha Reader and the Vowelles, who sing ditties
about, for instance, the joys of the short ``e'' sound; the
letter-bearing knights of ``Gawain's Word,'' whose jousting
collisions spell out words; and a cartoon hero called Cliff Hanger
who utilizes literacy skills to escape disaster. Also in the
picture is Dr. Ruth Wordheimer, a therapist who treats victims of
``long-word freakout,'' played by, natch, Dr. Ruth Westheimer.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``Lions'' packs a lot into its fast-moving half-hour.
There are times when it's overly busy, although in an era when so
many TV shows settle for less, even too much of a good thing is a
good thing. ``Between the Lions'' has the potential to be a
landmark show.
</P>
<P>
   But don't take my word for it, since I'm way outside the show's
target demographic. The 4-year-old TV critic in my household, a
discerning viewer, delivered this verdict midway through the first
episode of ``Between the Lions'': ``I love this!'' Chances are that
sentiment will be widespread.

HORSE HEAVEN 
By Jane Smiley. Knopf. 
561 pp. $26. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the sweetest smells in my olfactory archives belongs to a
horse stable that, about a decade ago, overlooked the Pamet River
on the Lower Cape. Staying in the house next door, I would wake at
dawn to the sounds of nickering horses, and to the equine smells _
meadow, then hay, then recycled hay _ that are as inextricable from
a stable as sweat or leather. Granted, not everybody would find
this an intoxicating memory. But to certain fanatics of varying
pedigrees _ little girls, track hounds, horse trainers,
large-animal veterinarians, romantics, jockeys, grooms, mare
managers, and, of course, the horses themselves _ there is scarcely
a finer scent on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Smiley gets a place on that list, for ``Horse Heaven'' is
so redolent with the essence of horse that you will probably have
alfalfa in your hair when you're done with it. This is a big,
burly, full-of-itself story that swaggers out of the gate, opens
easy on the track, breaks into a canter and stays there, in steady
state, until twilight. It's a novel of passion in every sense, from
the drive of the Thoroughbreds who run and fail and sometimes fly
into greatness, to the people who work with them, up at 3 a.m. and
sacrificing the rest of life _ if there is a rest of life _ in
order to hang out in a barn 18 hours a day or save a mare in labor.
And if Smiley's voice is as thrilled-but-controlled as a race
announcer's, she has also managed this far-flung story with a demon
narrative intelligence. It's one thing to get right the look of a
newborn foal (sweet, wet) or the frenzy of a winner's circle at the
Breeder's Cup (bedlam, letdown). It's another entirely to manage
emergency colic surgery, solitary stable lurkers, and the way a
race feels from the horse's back _ and do it all with aplomb,
muscle, and not a little grace. ``Well, he knows who he is,''
trainers say about one uppity Thoroughbred. So does ``Horse
Heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley's only predictable trait as a writer is her versatility.
Having wowed her way into acclaim with the careful literary feats
of ``The Age of Grief'' and ``Ordinary Love and Good Will,'' she
went on to produce high-serious (``A Thousand Acres'') and
high-funny (``Moo''), followed by an interminable faux-19th-century
novel (``The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton'')
that was saved only by its fierce authenticity. If ``Horse Heaven''
has a predecessor, it is ``Moo,'' mostly because of its unstoppable
energy; in the same way that Smiley infiltrated the hilarious gulag
of academe, she has gone native here. ``Horse Heaven'' is easily
too long by a third, and while that's a not inconsiderable problem,
it also may be the only substantial one the novel possesses.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing its perspective wisely, ``Horse Heaven'' opens in 1997
with the lineage of four Thoroughbred yearlings, two colts and two
fillies, who are on their way to all kinds of chaos and maybe
splendor. These are the stars that will light the way for the
intersecting paths of the novel, for the two things you can count
on in the horse business are that no animal stays put for long and
that eventually everything connects. Thus an 11-year-old girl in
Texas who tries to save an old neglected gelding by writing someone
in California will wind up, years later, blessed for her kindness
at a stable in Maryland. And the bay colt who starts off as ``Wow''
will resurface as ``Limitless,'' 3 years old and transcontinental,
as seemingly infinite in wins and attitude as he has been in
owners. Serendipity is the main thematic link of ``Horse Heaven,''
and if the first third of the story feels maddeningly overpopulated
(imagine a John le Carre novel with horses), the major players here
_ human and equine _ soon settle into a rhythm that ensures none
will get too misplaced or ill-remembered.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, of course, ``Horse Heaven'' had to follow its people
outside the corral; a whole dramatis personae consequently emerge
with stand-alone sagas, marked by the usual private fears and
secret dreams. There's trainer Farley Jones, who looks more like a
bearded professor than a horseman, who has a rule sheet titled
``The Tibetan Book of Thoroughbred Training'' pinned to his office
door _ who, his assistant reflects, is ``deep as a well and twice
as dark.'' There's the blustery industrialist Al Maybrick, richer
than sin and vigilantly sober for two years, who rises each day and
calls his AA sponsor, his horse trainer, and his broker. There's
the unforgettable Deirdre Donohue, a 40-year-old Irish horsewoman
who broke her back on a jumper; now she spends her days training
racehorses and trying not to fall too hard when she falls for one
of them, again. Oh, and there are myriad small-time winners and
losers, kindly veterinarians or mean ones, born-again crooked
trainers, a father-and-son betting team, a horse masseur with the
wisdom of Yoda, a Jack Russell terrier named Eileen, and _ Smiley's
link to the other side _ an animal communicator, formerly known as
a horse psychic, who gives a whole new meaning to omniscient point
of view.
</P>
<P>
   This conceptual leap needs some defense, lest it sound smarmy or
ill-conceived; indeed, a lesser writer couldn't possibly have
pulled it off. But by foisting the ``channeling'' onto a
big-hearted innocent named Elizabeth, Smiley has found a way in; as
a narrator, she's given herself entrance into the world of animal
consciousness. The maneuver is a neat trick for several reasons.
It's never heavy-handed, no more anthropomorphic than necessary,
and informed with scientific and behavioral savvy as well as humor.
Anyone ever moved by a cross-species attachment will not be
surprised by what Smiley has imagined; the corridors between most
species, as Jane Goodall will tell you, are lined with patience and
respect. All Smiley has done is to illuminate the hallway _ and
thus remind one of the sheer delights of literary invention.
Viewing the track through a 2-year-old filly's eyes seems no longer
a stretch than, say, comprehending what the Breeder's Cup means to
Al Maybrick. The first rule of omniscient license is one that
Smiley accomplishes from the moment Elizabeth opens her mouth: that
you simply be able to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's a bit of mystical drizzle all over ``Horse
Heaven,'' whether it's Al's wife, Rosalind, on an inner pilgrimage
in Ireland, or the bountiful love for their own kind that a few
lucky humans ultimately unearth. There's also a plentiful supply of
realism, horseracing being a business driven, on the worst days, by
greed, steroids, and unthinkable cruelty. Linking these disparate
realms of the sacred and profane is Smiley's wit, not to mention
her eye for near-perfect detail (including horses' names). Having
figured out a way to implant a sensory device in her pregnant
mares, a mare manager finds out that her horses have broken water
when the receiver dials her at home. ``It was 1:37. She picked up
the cellular phone. She heard her own voice say, `This is Donut. I
am foaling. Get up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   True to its ethos, the finest heroes in ``Horse Heaven'' are not
the horses in the winner's circles or the men and women who put
them there, but the wider cast _ the pony proletariat _ who hang
out, eat carrots, perform daily minor miracles, head-butt their
grooms, and spoil young girls for any lesser love their future
lives may bring them. If the story sometimes seems alarmingly
desultory, so, come to think of it, is the life of a racehorse. For
a novel that dares to roll in both the agony and the glory of the
human-equine contract, that's probably a predictable lament.

   WASHINGTON _ As Microsoft Corp. and prosecutors tried to
negotiate an antitrust settlement, they bogged down over how to
craft a loophole-free agreement that gave the famously aggressive
software maker no room to wriggle out of its promised changes in
behavior, sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the same problem will likely face Federal District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding over the case.
</P>
<P>
   With settlement talks collapsing on Saturday, Jackson is
expected to issue his verdict this week on whether Microsoft broke
the nation's antitrust laws. All indications are that he will rule
that Microsoft did violate the law, and that the trial should next
consider what penalty is in order.
</P>
<P>
   But as the judge tries to fashion a penalty, some analysts say
he will run into the same problems that hampered the settlement
talks: How to put limits on a diverse and aggressive company that
maintains complex relationships with both allies and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard enough for the government and Microsoft, working
directly with each other, to fashion a workable set of conduct
remedies,'' or limits on Microsoft's business behavior, said Rich
Gray, a Menlo Park, Calif., antitrust lawyer who has followed the
case closely. ``It's going to be even harder for a federal judge to
impose a workable set of remedies based on arguments and briefs and
a formal hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Department of Justice and 19 states charge that Microsoft
illegally used its Windows software monopoly to bully other
companies into taking actions that hurt consumers, and to try to
crush two companies, Netscape Communications Corp. and Sun
Microsystems Inc., which produced potential rivals to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing 76 days of testimony, Jackson issued ``findings of
fact'' last November that sided overwhelmingly with prosecutors and
portrayed Microsoft as a ruthless monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of settlement talks, which had been mediated by a
federal judge in Chicago, show how complex Jackson's task could be
if, as expected, he rules that Microsoft's conduct merits a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   His challenge could be glimpsed in the Justice Department's last
settlement offer, which, according to sources, held that Microsoft
would be required to set a uniform pricing schedule for Windows.
Microsoft would not be able, for example, to raise the price of
Windows for a computer-maker who wanted to load Netscape's Internet
browser, and not Microsoft's browser, on the computers it sold.
</P>
<P>
   But critics among the 19 states, as well as Microsoft's rivals
in the computer industry, complained that price was just one
mechanism that Microsoft uses to manipulate other companies, one
source said. Microsoft could still bully companies by backing out
of joint marketing deals or by withholding the right to display the
Windows logo on their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the software industry is that companies have
ongoing, deeply integrated business relationships,'' said one
person familiar with the prosecutors' thinking. ``With Windows,
it's not like you sell someone a car and they drive off the lot
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, this source said, the final Justice Department
proposal required Microsoft to reveal, for a fee, the most basic
computer code of Windows so that computer-makers could make
modifications. A computer-maker might include Netscape's browser
with Windows and make sure that the two products worked well
together. Or the computer-maker could change the screen that users
see when the first turn the computer on.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft reserved the right to withhold technical
support from parts of the software that had been altered. Critics
said that made the concession meaningless, because no
computer-maker would accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Ford saying that if you buy a new hood ornament,
your engine warranty is violated,'' said Ed Black, president of the
Computer and Communications Industry Association, which favors
tough sanctions against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also proposed, according to one source,
that Microsoft could integrate new features into Windows, but that
it could not write sales contracts that forced anyone to buy a
second Microsoft product along with Windows. Black said that
provision was weak, because Microsoft had many ways to bully
computer-makers into adopting Microsoft products and rejecting
products from Microsoft rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Justice Department proposal were requirements that
Microsoft reveal software code that allows other software-makers to
link their own products to Windows, and that technical information
be shared equally with all of Microsoft's partners without
discrimination. Justice Department lawyers also wanted to bar
Microsoft from raising the price of old versions of Windows when a
new one is released, a tactic Microsoft uses to encourage buyers to
adopt the newest edition of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Black said that the issue of how to enforce any agreement with
Microsoft was paramount, because the company had been so aggressive
in the past. In fact, it signed a consent decree to settle an
earlier case with the government, only to be accused by prosecutors
a year later of violating the terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Gray said it is difficult to enforce any company's promise
to change its practices. Even when company rules bar it, an
aggressive sales force or business-development team may want to cut
special deals on pricing or advertising to move a company's
products into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is a big organization, and for them to fully police
something with full internal cooperation is a non-trivial
exercise,'' Gray said. ``For an outside government agency to police
it . . . is just damn hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to go to the question of `Can the government
trust Microsoft?' before I get pessimistic about the value of
conduct remedies.''
</P>
<P>
   An alternative would be to impose a structural change on
Microsoft, such as breaking the company into pieces, possibly one
that produces Windows and one that makes other types of software.
</P>
<P>
   That penalty is considered by far the most extreme, but those
most critical of Microsoft say it is the only way to strip
Microsoft of one of its major advantages: the fact that it makes
both the Windows operating system and the word processors, Internet
browsers, graphics programs and other ``applications'' products
that works in conjunction with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and several of its allies sought to blame several of
the 19 state attorneys general in the case for the breakdown of
settlement talks. ``It's unfortunate that an outspoken minority of
AGs is holding the industry hostage by derailing settlement talks
at a time when resolution seemed possible,'' said Jonathan Zuck,
president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade
group that includes Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The National Taxpayers Union faulted ``overzealous state
attorneys general'' who ``would rather make headlines that make
headway toward ending this case.''
</P>
<P>
   But one person familiar with proceedings said that the feeling
was fairly uniform among states about what the settlement should
include, though states most involved in the talks may have
developed the strongest feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he doubted the deal fell apart just because of the
states. ``It's clear that Microsoft did not meet Justice's
standards for an agreement, regardless of meeting the standards set
by the states,'' Gray said.

   At the age of 87, Curtis Dowse is a living link to Nebraska's
past. In 1900, Dowse's father, grandfather and some of his
neighbors teamed up to build a house on the windswept Nebraska
plains _ made mostly from sod, the hardy top layer of soil that
pioneers found in abundance as they made their way west. While
Nebraska was once dotted with sod houses, it now has only about 100
of them in even minimally decent repair. Even so, they continue to
loom large _ and not only in the prairie mythology of Nebraska,
Kansas and the Dakotas. &QL;

   At the age of 87, Curtis Dowse is a living link to Nebraska's
past. In 1900, Dowse's father, grandfather and some of his
neighbors teamed up to build a house on the windswept Nebraska
plains _ made mostly from sod, the hardy top layer of soil that
pioneers found in abundance as they made their way west. While
Nebraska was once dotted with sod houses, it now has only about 100
of them in even minimally decent repair. Even so, they continue to
loom large _ and not only in the prairie mythology of Nebraska,
Kansas and the Dakotas. &QL;

   This election year may finally bring Americans face to face with
the failure of their system of public education. The confrontation
will be painful: 30 years of decline cannot be easily reversed.
But, if the right lessons are drawn, they could make American
schools models for the world once again. &QL;

   OPEC struck a deal this week to pump a bit more oil on to the
volatile world market. At first blush, such news seems as hard to
criticize as motherhood and apple pie. After all, the volatility of
the past two years has been a curse for all. Yet, it may be a
mistake for Americans to encourage the market manipulators at OPEC.
At best, it will be a Faustian bargain. At worst, America will
needlessly boost the fortunes of a fickle cartel. &QL;

   Since the end of NATO's war over Kosovo last June, the West's
adversary, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, has tightened his
grip on power, at least in his native Serbia, and raised the
rhetorical temperature. Several ominous signs suggest that his next
land grab could be Montenegro, the last remaining republic with
which Serbia is linked in the shrunken Yugoslav federation. &QL;

   Throughout the state of Texas, public schools have developed
tougher academic standards and improved their performance in
assessment tests, an achievement that George W. Bush mentions
constantly in stump speeches on the presidential campaign trail. It
is the cornerstone of his claim to be a ``reformer with results.''
That boast requires two questions: Have Texan schools truly
improved? And if so, how much of it has been Bush's doing? &QL;

&HT;     NOSE RING HELPS AWAKEN CULTURAL IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KINNARI SHAH  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``But you're even more American than I am!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you've never seemed Indian to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there's my favorite, usually offered
enthusiastically, beamingly, by these non-Indian friends _ as
though conferring the greatest accolade of all: ``You're so
Americanized that I never think of you as different at all!''
</P>
<P>
   So I went to India and got my nose pierced.
</P>
<P>
   Not directly, not like that. And not just because they'd said
those things. But after having lived my entire life in this
country, I think friends were startled to realize that I still felt
a connection with my cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, I think people feel threatened by what seems
``different.'' Not threatened-scared in any xenophobic way, but
threatened-discombobulated.
</P>
<P>
   It bothers me when friends, complacent in their degree of
emotional connection with me, exclaim in shock and discomfort when
they realize that there are still many ways in which I do not feel,
cannot feel, they share my particular window on the world.
</P>
<P>
   Or they grow offended when they hear me call myself Indian
despite their protestations, thinking that I seek deliberately to
distance myself, that I fancy my viewpoint superior or imagine them
incapable of empathy.
</P>
<P>
   Or they laugh at me _ wanting to believe that because I don't
dress in ways that would clearly mark me as ``other,'' because my
speech is unaccented, my line of work conventional and my interests
along ``Westernized'' lines, that I am therefore ``just like
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The current brand of political correctness demands that its
adherents be so proudly tolerant of differences that they start
believing that there are no differences.
</P>
<P>
   But different needn't be better and is definitely not worse.
It's only ... different.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to my nose ring _ that tiny sliver of diamond you
almost might not see _ were therefore telling. I could tell at a
glance or from the first stammered compliment who was sincere in
approbation and who wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   So it takes some getting used to. That's fine. It took me a
while as well. Amazing how such a little thing as this double-take
sparkle can alter the contours of one's face. And, of course, the
assumptions associated with body piercings in general made friends
throw askance glances: ``I never figured you for a radical.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there were those people who were happier to
think that I had done it for fashion reasons than for reasons of
ethnic identity.
</P>
<P>
   When I told one friend how, when I went to India last January
and saw that every one of my female cousins had her nose pierced, I
decided to do it as well, as a kind of connection to them and my
vouchsafed heritage in general, he retorted, ``But you're back here
now. You're back in America now.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at him in surprise and said, ``But I'm still Indian. I
always was.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I don't think wearing my nose ring makes me more
Indian. Rather, it allows me to insist I'm Indian at all. And so,
some months after I returned from our long-delayed family trip to
India, I think I've finally realized why I got my nose pierced: To
lay a more solid claim to who I am.

   How should the world judge Vladimir Putin, the man who in less
than eight months has come from obscurity to having, after last
weekend's election, won the job of ruling the largest swathe of the
globe under one flag?
</P>
<P>
   The limited information that can be fathomed from his murky past
and ambiguous present gives rise to both hope and alarm. The causes
for alarm are many, about Russia as well as about its new
president.
</P>
<P>
   If you take what Putin says at face value, he has a warped sense
of history and a moral framework in which the ends justify the
means.
</P>
<P>
   He is proud of his 17 years in the KGB, one of the world's
nastiest intelligence services, and has failed to acknowledge its
part in making Russia a living hell for most of the past century.
Many of the people who seem to have his ear are old KGB hands.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also seems to have an affection for the old Soviet Union.
He bemoans its breakup, wags his finger menacingly at small
countries recently freed from its thrall, and has cynically used
the chaos of Chechnya as a pretext for unleashing vastly
disproportionate force against its people.
</P>
<P>
   He sounds dismissive of press freedoms and human rights. As for
the corruption that Putin says he will erase, it seems all too
likely to continue, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is probable that Boris Yeltsin handed over the
presidential mantle after Christmas on the understanding that his
family and friends would be immune from justice on that score.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has promised that the ``oligarchs'' _ the small group of
tycoons who have prospered so conspicuously since the mid-1990s by
suborning Russia's politicians _ will be ``distanced from power,''
but during his brief prime ministership and acting presidency they
stayed as close to it as ever.
</P>
<P>
   And yet not everything about Putin is discouraging. Some signs
look worrying but may not be: Putin's desire to ``make Russia
strong,'' for instance, could in fact bring a change for the better
if it meant imposing law and order where corruption and chaos have
prevailed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs suggest that Putin is at least a clever politician.
He seems efficient, intelligent and, despite the nationalist
flannel, more open to western economic ideas than any of his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   He has recruited some genuine reformers. And there is no denying
that he has shown an uncanny instinct for gauging the national
mood, unedifying though that often is.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is whether he will behave as the creature of
the discredited Yeltsin regime, and of the oligarchs behind it.
Tentative answers may come from his appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Putin cannot be expected to wipe the political slate clean at
once. He will have to accommodate the Duma, the lower house of
parliament, and handle the regional governors deftly.
</P>
<P>
   The relative success of the Communist candidate, Gennady
Zyuganov, who came second in the poll with 29 percent to Putin's 53
percent, means that the new president may let the Communists have
more posts than he might have wished.
</P>
<P>
   But he should not be unduly awed by them: the voters have made
it plain that, though they do not like the current state of
affairs, most of them emphatically do not want to go back to the
totalitarian past.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists should be suspicious, too, if Putin appoints Mikhail
Kasyanov, the current finance minister, to the prime ministership:
he is too close to at least one oligarch.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it will be good news if he fires the head of
the Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, unless he replaces him with
someone even more lethargic.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was studiously vague about policy during what passed for
an election campaign. As a result, he has done little to prepare
public opinion, let alone to persuade it of the necessity of yet
more short-term unpleasantness for the sake of longer-term
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   If he is wise, he will make a quick start on reform: the high
oil price since early 1999 has been a windfall for the economy, but
prices are now falling.
</P>
<P>
   Two areas crying out for reform are tax and land. An early
pledge to enact a new and simpler tax code and to enable land to be
easily bought, sold and thus developed is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   And in a year or so, if the new man in the Kremlin is feeling
secure, he would do well to let parliament trim the power of the
mighty presidency in favor of that of the Duma. That would go far
towards dispelling fears that he is at heart an autocrat. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More urgently, Putin should be more sensible and humane over
Chechnya. While the generals are still striving to subjugate the
place by force, the president should be exploring political
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   That will not be easy: there are few plausible Chechens left
with whom to negotiate. Even so, he should try to find them.
Otherwise he will have a lingering terrorist problem on his hands
which will only strengthen the influence of anti-democrats in the
``power ministries'' in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's biggest and clearest test will be judicial. Several big
cases are pending against oligarchs. Under Yeltsin, they were safe
from the courts, at home or abroad. It is crucial that under Putin
they should not be.
</P>
<P>
   If Putin starts to bring them to justice, it will be a sign that
he is indeed his own man. It may even be a sign that he genuinely
wants to start turning Russia into what it has never been before _
a state where the law prevails, and where judges do not have to
defer to the president in administering justice. &QL;

<P>
   This election year may finally bring Americans face to face with
the failure of their system of public education.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation will be painful: 30 years of decline cannot be
easily reversed. But, if the right lessons are drawn, they could
make American schools models for the world once again.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates know it. Al Gore spent March 24 at a
middle school in Michigan, earnestly discussing his ``revolutionary
improvements'' with students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, George W. Bush was at a high school in Arkansas
proclaiming his radical plans.
</P>
<P>
   Both sounded as if they were running for Superintendent of
National Education. Suspend your disbelief. Even political
campaigns can stumble on to something important.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that education in America is a matter largely for the
states. The federal government spends only seven cents in every
education dollar, mostly in the poorest schools.
</P>
<P>
   The detail of what presidential candidates promise matters
little. But the approach they exemplify and can go on to promote
from the White House matters a lot. And so, for sure, does
education.
</P>
<P>
   America's education system is in the sort of crisis that
Detroit's car industry faced in the 1970s, before Japanese imports
almost destroyed it in the 1980s. Teachers and parents are uneasily
aware that something is wrong but have little idea how bad matters
really are.
</P>
<P>
   At fourth grade (ten years old), American children score better
in reading and science than most pupils in 20 other rich countries,
and are about average in mathematics. At eighth grade, they are
still slightly better than average in maths and science but fall
behind in reading.
</P>
<P>
   By 12th grade, they are behind 95 percent of the children in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The longer children stay in American schools, the worse they
seem to get. Even today most educational organizations _ especially
the teachers' unions _ are in denial about the extent of the
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't America's economy the envy of the world? It is, but
employers agonize about the quality of high-school graduates and
spend millions correcting it.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three-quarters of ten-year-olds in the poorest public
schools have not yet begun to read or write; the illiteracy rate
among 17-year-olds is one in seven.
</P>
<P>
   Poor education lies behind the looming problem of inequality,
between the new economy's winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't American universities the envy of the world? The best
ones are. But too many have to spend too much time on ``remedial''
work.
</P>
<P>
   There are problems even at the top. America is not keeping up
with demand for computer graduates. Immigrants account for a third
of Silicon Valley's high-tech work force. As once with cars, so now
in education: America finds itself having to import other
countries' successes. This does not have to be.
</P>
<P>
   Correcting educational failure _ particularly at secondary
schools _ is the most important domestic task facing the nation. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore, ever aware that he has the firm support of the teachers'
unions, wants to spend more money on schools as they are. He would
increase spending by $115 billion over ten years, mostly on
providing universal preschool education and hiring 100,000 new
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says little about money but wants to test all children
every year and give the parents of children in failing schools
money to spend in the school of their choice. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Americans can vote either to spend more on schools, or to change
the education system first, and then see whether more should be
spent. They should start with the system.
</P>
<P>
   Is America _ rarely generous in the provision of public services
_ starving its public schools of money they need? It is not. It
spends almost 6 percent of its national income on primary and
secondary education, more than any OECD country except Denmark and
Canada. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, surprising as it may seem, the growing educational
disparity between rich and poor schools can not be traced to
differences in spending. Some inner-city schools get less money
than suburban ones. Others get more.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., one of the poorest parts of America, spends
roughly twice as much per pupil as suburban Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The schools have not failed for want of money. So, desirable
though some of Gore's proposals may be (such as breaking up
impersonally large public schools into smaller units), they are not
enough. More drastic change is needed. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reform has worked where it has been tried. The educational gap
between whites and nonwhites has narrowed dramatically in Texas
since school testing began (which was before Bush became governor).
</P>
<P>
   Another promising option, though one that regularly falls foul
of the courts, is ``voucher schemes,'' which allow parents to
choose where to spend public money educating their children.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, pupils in voucher schools scored 11 percentage
points more in mathematics than their hapless contemporaries in the
city's public schools. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut has the highest educational standards in the
country, thanks largely to stringent testing (and higher salaries)
for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The claim that changing the system will improve standards is
impossible to prove. The argument rests on anecdote, on the current
failure, and on common sense, which says that a producer-driven
system insulated from parents and children will fail. It cannot be
accidental that the more successful university system is more open
to competition. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the poorest areas, there is overwhelming support for
vouchers; and millions of Americans are opting out of the school
system altogether, choosing to educate their children at home.
That, in itself, is enough to warrant a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   In a country as diverse as America, that approach will vary.
Some places will choose vouchers, proposed by Milton Friedman 40
years ago. Some will encourage charter schools _ privately managed
public schools. Some will link financing to school performance. But
first voters have to make the basic decision: to open up the system
to competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming elections, national and local, let them back the
candidates who will bring choice and accountability to a system too
long stifled by the monopoly powers of teachers and their allies. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We are not in the business of fixing prices... we are in the
business of stabilizing prices.''
</P>
<P>
   So declared Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC's secretary-general, after the
oil cartel struck a deal this week to pump a bit more oil on to the
volatile world market.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who had been pressing OPEC to raise production,
did not object to this curious distinction. Indeed, the White House
gushed that the deal was ``good news.''
</P>
<P>
   From the sidelines, other governments and private analysts also
cheered the cartel for a ``responsible'' decision that helps both
consumers and producers.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, this aim of massaging the world oil market to
bring stable prices seems as hard to criticize as motherhood and
apple pie. After all, the volatility of the past two years, when
the price of oil first collapsed to around $10 a barrel and then
shot up to over $30, has been a curse for all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though it seems good tactics now, it may be a mistake for
the Americans to encourage the market manipulators at OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   At best, it will be a Faustian bargain. At worst, America will
needlessly boost the fortunes of a fickle cartel that has in the
past, in the famous words of a former American president, Jimmy
Carter, declared ``the moral equivalent of war'' on consumers.
</P>
<P>
   This week's OPEC summit in Vienna suggests three good reasons
why the world should not pin too much hope on the cartel's
responsible behavior.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, the cozy cabal may fall apart. It has happened
before. The temptation of easy money may become too great, and some
OPEC members may cheat so egregiously on their quotas that the
cartel's discipline is undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Political infighting of one sort or another is sure to emerge.
There were indeed signs of discord on display in Vienna: Iran, the
second-biggest producer within OPEC, refused to sign the final
agreement, claiming that the market did not need so much extra oil.
</P>
<P>
   If prices fall in coming weeks in response to the cartel's
production increase, might not some other countries agree?
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the world to keep its distance from this
manipulative bunch is that the convergence of interests of
consumers and producers is just a mirage. In the long run, the
interests of consumers are not the same as those of producers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, where sensitivity to petroleum prices is most
pronounced, should remember that its consumers would benefit most
from the lower prices that would inevitably follow if the oil
market were not rigged.
</P>
<P>
   As for OPEC countries, they know that they must talk a good game
about ``comfortable'' prices for all. Ultimately, though, their
first loyalty will always be to the depleted exchequers of their
often over-indebted and extravagant rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, it is extremely unlikely that the cartel can
actually deliver the stability that everybody seems to crave.
</P>
<P>
   Many have interpreted recent high oil prices as a sign of the
group's strength. Yet, if there is a lesson from the behavior of
oil prices over the past two years, it is precisely the opposite:
even OPEC cannot manage the market with precision.
</P>
<P>
   Oil plunged to $10 a barrel because the cartel foolishly
expanded output just as the Asian economic crisis was unfolding.
Its recent apparent success disguises similar failure.
</P>
<P>
   When the group set out to boost oil prices last year, in
collusion with Mexico and Norway, it was aiming for prices of
around $18-20 a barrel. Yet they recently rose past $30.
</P>
<P>
   And now, once again, the mutterings of oil ministers suggest
that they are aiming to achieve ``stable'' prices of around $25 a
barrel. If they hit this target, it will be by sheer luck _ and
luck can change.
</P>
<P>
   As the past two years' roller coaster has shown, market forces
have a confounded habit of reasserting themselves. Not everybody
agrees, however. Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and the
newly elected president of OPEC, says there is no chance of a
free-fall in prices.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it is precisely such self-delusion that makes the giddy
world of OPEC go round and round. &QL;

<P>
   Lost in their cyberdreams in Lisbon, the European Union's
leaders must have felt pleasantly far from the mess in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   They did, it is true, offer some reassuring generalities about
fast-track procedures for effective assistance and so on in their
conclusions; and EU panjandrums and officials from a host of
governments and international institutions were taking stock of the
Balkan imbroglio again in Brussels a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little evidence that the Union's leaders are ready
to devote the necessary attention to an issue that should be high
on the agenda of any European political summit right now: the
avoidance of another war in the Balkans, which remains all too real
a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In case the summiteers have forgotten, the most dramatic event
in Europe last year was not, alas, the launch of some bold economic
experiment but the outbreak of the continent's most intensive war
for half a century _ and its conclusion on terms that offered no
guarantee against a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the war over Kosovo last June, the West's
adversary, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, has tightened his
grip on power, at least in his native Serbia, and raised the
rhetorical temperature.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who thrives on wars, even though they invariably
leave him king of an ever-smaller castle. Several signs suggest
that his next war could be fought over Montenegro, the last
remaining republic with which Serbia is linked in the shrunken
Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is hardly a model democracy, neither is its
president, Milo Djukanovic, a model citizen. But he is pro-western
and no friend of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he has been trying to put some distance between his
small republic and Serbia, and the West would rightly like to see
him succeed, so long as his efforts do not precipitate a bloody
rupture. That, however, is just what Milosevic might welcome.
</P>
<P>
   As an indicted war criminal, in charge of a country under
sanctions, Milosevic may well calculate that he has nothing to lose
by testing transatlantic solidarity once again and drawing Russia's
new administration, as well as NATO, into an international crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As the experience of the past decade makes plain, European
governments cannot keep the peace in the Balkans without taking
America into account.
</P>
<P>
   In the continent's potential killing fields, moreover, there is
a natural division of labor whereby America's might serves as a
strategic deterrent, while artfully applied economic assistance
from EU governments keeps local antagonisms from boiling over.
</P>
<P>
   In sensitive spots like Macedonia, Kosovo and, above all,
Montenegro, the swift dispatch of relatively small sums of
financial assistance could well make the difference between peace
and war.
</P>
<P>
   Many European politicians understand this perfectly well, but
their collective response to the need has shown up many of the EU's
worst features: introversion, lack of urgency and an obsession with
arcane technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans no less than in cyberspace, the EU is always
capable of conjuring up lofty visions.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's conference in Brussels on economic development in
southeastern Europe, there was much talk _ some of it sensible _
about the need for bridges, roads, railway links and the like to
create interdependence.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a realization that Montenegro's pro-western
government needs aid over the next few weeks if it is to fend off
economic warfare from Serbia and maintain some credibility at home.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic says Milosevic is trying to promote a coup against
him, using Yugoslav troops garrisoned in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   There was a realization, too, that spending money wisely in the
Balkans is not quite the same as spending it freely: if the aim is
to keep Djukanovic in power, it must go to pay the pensions of
deserving Montenegrins (including the Serb-minded) and so on, not
to finance cigarette-smuggling by corrupt members of the regime.
</P>
<P>
   But did all that add up to action? In Lisbon, the heads of
government urged the ``competent institutions'' _ including,
presumably, their own finance ministers _ to ``make necessary
decisions'' to help Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   But if those decisions continue to be held up by technicalities
and buck-passing between different parts of the EU's
decision-making structure, they may come too late to bolster the
Montenegrin government against a takeover bid by Milosevic _ and
hence too late to avert another war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   If Europe's minds are indeed genuinely concentrated on high, no
time should be wasted in taking action lower down. &QL;

   Next month, on Mothers' Day, Washington will see its largest
public demonstration for years. Hundreds of thousands of women will
descend on the Capitol to lobby Congress to pass tougher
gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Senator John McCain's swashbuckling demands for
campaign-finance reform, the planned ``million mom march'' is the
clearest example of the frustration building up at the way Congress
has been paralyzed by vested interest groups (in this case, the
National Rifle Association).
</P>
<P>
   But there is a more insidious _ and so far more successful _
response to the gridlock. If the political process is snarled up,
go to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   There, judges are willing to regulate by litigation what
Congress will not influence by legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few months, a variety of groups _ ranging from
private law firms and state attorneys-general to municipal
governments and the Department of Justice _ have been pursuing gun
makers through the courts to recoup some of the costs of shootings.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, the threat of legal action persuaded America's
largest handgun maker, Smith &AMP; Wesson, to settle. It will abide by
a variety of restrictions in exchange for immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies are already paying out $246 billion in a
similar out-of-court settlement with the states. But that deal did
not give them immunity from class-action suits or individual
prosecutions. So this week, a San Francisco court ordered Philip
Morris and R.J. Reynolds to pay $20 million in punitive damages to
just one smoker.
</P>
<P>
   A court in Miami is mulling over a class-action suit brought on
behalf of all Florida's smokers.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions do not merely go where politicians feared to
tread: they actually contradict Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, lawmakers voted down some of the restrictions that
Smith &AMP; Wesson has agreed to. And in the case of tobacco, the
plaintiffs justified the vast sum by saying that the companies
could afford it by raising the price of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the settlement required the equivalent of a new
cigarette tax _ something Congress had explicitly ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Well so what? Many will say ``that's Congress's fault for
failing to legislate.'' Supporters of judicial activism point out
that American courts have always played a more active role than
courts in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Microsoft is being debated in front of a judge. It
was a judge who broke up AT&AMP;T. And (in a different category) it was
the Supreme Court that insisted on the application of civil-rights
laws throughout the land in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The supporters of court action are right when they say that the
supposedly clear distinction between Congress, which makes the law,
and the judiciary, which applies it, is not clear at all.
</P>
<P>
   The courts routinely decide what a law actually means because
Congress routinely fails to be explicit. Does the Americans with
Disabilities Act cover people with AIDS? Congress did not say, so
the courts had to determine that it did.
</P>
<P>
   Are companies liable for sexual discrimination in the workplace
even if they do not know it is happening? Again, Congress left it
to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional ambiguity breeds judicial activism. That said, it
is clear that, however fuzzy the line, there is not only a
difference between Congress and the courts, but the courts are
intrinsically bad forums for deciding broad matters of national
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Judges do not have teams of policy experts to advise them, as
congressmen do. They are not always subject to voters' scrutiny.
The courts are usually called upon to decide on clashes of private
interests, not the balance of public ones.
</P>
<P>
   The coalitions involved in the tobacco and gun cases, for
instance, are plainly not adequate proxies for the interests
involved in a national debate. On the one side are the companies
themselves, on the other, much of the initiative comes from private
lawyers who stand to reap vast fees.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by two government departments to get involved in
the suits _ the Justice Department against the tobacco companies,
and Housing and Urban Development against the gun makers _ makes
matters worse: the administration is supposed to pursue its policy
agenda through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And if a court decision is not the best way to set public
policy, the out-of-court settlement is an even worse one.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Taylor, a legal columnist with National Journal in
Washington, points out that the astronomical rise in legal costs
has meant that the mere threat of court action can now be enough to
arm-twist companies into accepting new rules or taxes _ even if (as
happened with tobacco) the companies have won most of the initial
court cases.
</P>
<P>
   It must be said that the tobacco and gun settlements command a
good deal of public support. That is because tobacco companies and
gun makers rank alongside pederasts and journalists in the
inventory of American dis-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that there can be no guarantee that public
backing will continue if the courts were asked to settle more
controversial cases, such as whether purveyors of fatty foods are
liable for the public health costs of obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial of all American domestic policy issues,
whether to permit abortion, was decided by the Supreme Court, and
has continued to split opinion ever since. A similar fate may yet
await the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court to give legal
backing to same-sex marriages. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Some decisions may always be controversial. The Constitution has
a response to that. The often maddening division of powers between
the administration and Congress was set up expressly to ensure that
when laws are passed, they at least command broad public support.
</P>
<P>
   Courts are much less likely than Congress to produce outcomes
with that kind of backing. Their advantage (from the point of view
of activists) is that they have to take decisions; Congress can
postpone actions on divisive matters.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the recent increase in judicial activism may, in the
long run, produce more controversy than the congressional
foot-dragging that so encourages it.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the million moms may well be pleased that the gun makers
are getting hounded in court. But there is a better way. And by
gathering in their thousands to lobby politicians, they are
pursuing it. &QL;

   MILWAUKEE _ Milwaukee is an unlikely laboratory for the
country's most radical experiment in ``conservative'' reform of
education.
</P>
<P>
   The city gave birth to the Progressive movement and elected a
succession of socialist mayors. Its Democratic mayor, John
Norquist, is about to be reelected for a fourth term. Yet there can
be no doubt about the boldness of the city's experiment with school
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The voucher program was subject to all sorts of restrictions
when it was started in 1990, with only 1 percent of schoolchildren
eligible and religious schools excluded.
</P>
<P>
   But it gained momentum in 1998 when Wisconsin's Supreme Court
ruled that vouchers could go to parochial schools, and gained more
momentum still in 1999 when local voters swept voucher opponents
off the school board.
</P>
<P>
   The most fervent support for vouchers has come from the city's
large black population. The blacks were tired of seeing their
children having to travel on buses so that schools in white
neighborhoods could achieve the court-mandated goal of racial
balance.
</P>
<P>
   The most public faces of the black voucher movement were Polly
Williams, a state legislator and sometime Jesse Jackson supporter,
and Howard Fuller, a former superintendent of schools who now runs
the Institute for the Transformation of Learning at Marquette
University.
</P>
<P>
   But they spoke for people like Valerie Johnson, a mother of five
who had seen her brothers destroyed by the Chicago school system
(one was murdered for refusing to join a gang, one dropped out of
school and is now homeless in California) and is determined that
her own children should avoid the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll found that 74 percent of blacks and 77 percent of
Hispanics approve of vouchers. The Milwaukee experiment crosses all
the usual barriers of race and party.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-choice coalition now includes the state's Republican
governor, Tommy Thompson, the city's chamber of commerce and, most
important, Mayor Norquist, who is convinced that the only way to
stop the middle classes abandoning the cities is to improve city
schools.
</P>
<P>
   There are already heartening signs that the choice program is
doing exactly that. Test scores are edging up. The city's private
schools are becoming more racially integrated. One school, Messmer
High, has eliminated the gap in test scores between blacks and
whites.
</P>
<P>
   The voucher program is also stimulating an array of new choices.
The University of Wisconsin has teamed up with the Edison Project,
a private education company, to create a scientifically flavored
charter school intended to increase the supply of qualified blacks
for its medical school.
</P>
<P>
   A ``cyber school'' has opened its doors in a housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Another new arrival is the terrifyingly named New Order
Neighborhood School, which requires children to help smarten up the
neighborhood as part of their curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   What about the rest of the school system? Opponents of vouchers
worry that private and parochial schools can flourish only at the
expense of public schools. But so far this is not the case in
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The public schools are generally smartening up their act. The
district has taken out radio advertisements promising that it will
provide an individual tutor to children who cannot read by second
grade.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher opponents have long complained that vouchers are a plot
to privatize education. For the poor people of Milwaukee they are
doing something different: turning all schools into public
schools. &QL;

<P>
   ODESSA AND AUSTIN, TEXAS _ The rise in the oil price last year
brought a wry smile in Odessa. This windswept oil city in western
Texas is still reeling from 1998, when oil prices plunged. Hundreds
of families have left town in search of work, shrinking Odessa's
tax base and the budget for things like schools.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is little pessimism at Gail Pond Alamo Elementary
School. Last year, 92 percent of Gail Pond Alamo's students passed
the state's standardized reading test, up from 70 percent three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Latino pupils who make up over half of the total, 95
percent passed the mathematics test and a stunning 100 percent the
writing test.
</P>
<P>
   Those students at Gail Pond Alamo deemed ``limited English
proficient'' had a 90 percent pass rate on the reading test, up
from 29 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround is not unique. Throughout the state, public
schools have developed tougher academic standards and improved
their performance in assessment tests.
</P>
<P>
   It is a subject that George W. Bush mentions constantly in stump
speeches on the presidential campaign trail. Governor Bush uses the
achievements of public schools in Texas as the cornerstone of his
claim to be a ``reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   That boast requires two questions. Have Texan schools improved?
And, if they have, how much of it has been Bush's doing?
</P>
<P>
   He scores pretty well on both counts. No intellectual though he
is on many issues, Bush can out-wonk most people when it comes to
public education.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became governor in 1995, Bush has shepherded proposals
through Texas's legislature that have overhauled the state's
academic standards, placed new emphasis on reading proficiency, and
ended the bizarre practice of ``social promotion'' _ advancing to
higher grades even students who fail standard tests.
</P>
<P>
   His two chief themes have been ``accountability'' and ``local
control.'' Local school districts have been allowed to develop
their own curriculums, but they have been held accountable for the
achievement (and failure) of their students.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores have improved dramatically, with the number of
public schools deemed ``exemplary'' by the Texas Education Agency
rising to 1,110, up from a mere 67 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Minority students do particularly well; the gap between the test
scores of whites and those of blacks and Latinos has started to
close. In 1998, Texas's Latinos ranked fourth in reading among
Latinos nationwide, and the state's black fourth-graders were the
country's best at mathematics in 1996. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 425) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kati Haycock of the Education Trust, a nonpartisan group, says
that ``minority students in Texas have shown substantial progress,
which is not true of most states.''
</P>
<P>
   There are holes in this picture. The dropout rate in Texan
schools is still way above the national figure (though, given the
vast numbers of poor immigrants, that is hardly surprising).
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, egged on by the teachers' unions, claim that Bush's
standardized tests are biased against nonwhites, and disrupt the
learning process by forcing teachers to ``teach to the test.''
</P>
<P>
   At Gail Pond Alamo, this complaint gets short shrift. ``Of
course we teach to the tests,'' says Janet Baker, the principal.
``There happens to be some very valuable knowledge in them.''
</P>
<P>
   In her view, regular testing is the only way to measure student
progress over time. ``Without testing,'' Bush said in a speech last
October, ``reform is a journey without a compass.'' Parents seem to
like tests as much as the teachers' unions dislike them. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush's part in these changes, one group of critics says
that education reform in Texas really began in 1984, when a
private-sector commission led by Ross Perot recommended more
accountability for the state's public schools. That was the basis
of the first curriculum-overhaul under Bush's predecessor, Ann
Richards.
</P>
<P>
   This is true. Still, by most tests, Bush has gone a long way
further.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of critics tries a slightly different tack: that
governors of Texas cannot really reform anything, because they do
not control the legislature. It is the latter that should thus get
credit. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The feud over authorship is something of a novelty. Given the
bitterness of this year's presidential election campaign, no
Democrat wants to sing Bush's praises too loudly. A few years ago,
though, plenty of local Democrats were willing to acknowledge
Bush's role in pushing through a bipartisan deal.
</P>
<P>
   There was some useful horse-trading: Paul Sadler, a Democrat who
at the time chaired the Texan lower house's Public Education
Committee, emphasized more money for education in general, and Bush
pushed for tougher penalties for bad schools.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Bush gets the occasional kind mention _ at least in
Texas. Sadler admits that the governor's commitment to education
reform is genuine and praises him for following through on his
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Kress, a Democrat who was chairman of a state task force
on school accountability, tips his hat to Bush for removing the
education-reform process from partisan politics. ``Education is not
just a political buzzword for him.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,250) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No doubt quibbling about how much credit Bush should take for
Texas's better schools is like asking whether another great
self-publicist, Rudy Giuliani, deserves all the credit for New York
City's safer streets.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man did it alone; but they provided most of the shove
behind the improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rival for the presidency, Al Gore, seems to have decided
to ignore this side of things. He is just trying to cast doubt on
the scale of the achievement, for instance by criticizing the
state's dropout rate.
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard for the Democrats to depict Bush as just another
right-winger who wants to save money by closing down schools. On
March 28, the governor proposed a $5 billion plan to make sure that
every child in America can read by the age of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago Bob Dole called for the dissolution of the
Department of Education, arguing that the federal government ought
to have virtually no role in how public schools are managed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to leave it alone. ``Tell me how shutting down the
Department of Education will help educate one kid,'' growls a
Bushite.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for some reformers, Bush is not radical enough.
Advocates of school vouchers were disappointed that Bush did not
push harder for a pilot voucher project the Texas legislature
killed last year.
</P>
<P>
   During the Republican primaries, his proposal to make federal
cash contingent on a school's performance was attacked as a ``big
government'' solution to a local issue.
</P>
<P>
   Such protests from the right are likely to die away. For
Republicans, Bush's record represents the best chance to show not
only that their candidate is a serious fellow but also that he can
produce results for poorer Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He attacks liberals who make excuses for poor and nonwhite
students who get low marks: this, he says, is the ``soft bigotry of
low expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, this is more a matter of talk than of direct action:
the federal government accounts for only 7 percent of all education
spending. But, in this field, what presidential candidates say can
matter a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name Bush's main achievement, even his old sparring
partner, Sadler, admits that the governor has made ordinary people
in Texas see the possibility of better education. ``For that,'' he
generously says, ``the governor deserves all the credit in the
world.'' &QL;

LATIN AMERICA'S REVIVING ECONOMIES: PROMISE AND PITFALLS

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The economies of Latin America are on the mend.
That was the message from bankers and finance officials this week
at the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),
held this year in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the spring sunshine, and forecasts that Latin
America will see economic growth of up to 4 percent this year, the
mood was curiously flat.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the numbing sterility of the cavernous concrete
shed that is the New Orleans Convention Center, or the absence of
any pulse-quickening financial crisis in the region. Or perhaps it
was simply the knowledge that for Latin America any talk of boom is
so often merely a prelude to sickening bust.
</P>
<P>
   After growing strongly in 1997, South America was hit hard in
1998-99 by the backwash from the financial troubles of Asia and
Russia: capital fled almost all emerging markets, and prices for
the region's exports of raw materials plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico came through relatively unscathed, thanks to the North
American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and its strong links with the
booming American economy.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Mexico look likely to survive its presidential
election in July without economic turbulence, but Brazil, Latin
America's largest economy, is also bouncing back strongly after its
chaotic devaluation of January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This fairly swift recovery owes much to strong growth in rich
countries and to higher prices for raw materials. The oil price has
soared, helping big exporters such as Mexico and Venezuela. Prices
of some other commodities that the region exports are up this year
too.
</P>
<P>
   Good management, not just good luck, has also played a part. By
and large, Latin American governments have kept fiscal policy
tight, and stuck to pro-market policies. They are now being
rewarded by the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the turmoil of the past two years casts a long shadow. It
has certainly added to the region's social problems. According to
the World Bank, 36.4 percent of Latin Americans lived in poverty in
1998. That figure has since risen, as unemployment in the region
has soared to its highest level since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, recovery is patchy. Argentina and Colombia are still
struggling to emerge from deep recessions. Ecuador, though small,
is a particular worry. Its economy has all but collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   With desperate determination, its new government, installed
after a military coup in January, is pushing ahead with a plan to
adopt the dollar. It has gained congressional approval for sweeping
reforms of the kind adopted elsewhere in the region a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is supposed to give its approval to Ecuador's
dollarization scheme later this month, releasing a $2 billion
bundle of international loans. But many international finance
officials admit privately that the scheme is a gamble: ``one of the
riskiest operations we have been involved in,'' says one.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the government will manage to implement its
tough fiscal program and resist pressure to bail out local bankers
and firms.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it certain that much-needed private capital will return
to Ecuador before the government has persuaded its creditors to
write off some of its unpayable debts. That could take years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest worry, however, is whether Latin America can now
achieve sustained high growth, avoiding the boom-bust pattern of
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of often painful liberal reforms, annual growth
averaged a disappointing 3 percent for the decade. For that, blame
chiefly Latin America's dependence on volatile flows of foreign
capital.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, foreign investors are smiling on the region.
Its main economies should attract some $92 billion in private
capital this year, up from $65 billion in 1999, according to the
Institute of International Finance, a bankers' group.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on many Latin American sovereign bonds have fallen,
meaning that external finance is becoming cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is especially favored: in March, its sovereign bonds were
awarded the coveted status of ``investment grade'' by Moody's, a
credit-rating agency.
</P>
<P>
   This more benign view of Latin America should help the region
ride out further rises in interest rates in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent turmoil, foreign direct investment in the
region, in factories and firms rather than bonds and shares, has
risen sharply, to $67 billion last year from $36 billion in 1996.
Much of this money has been attracted by privatization, and is less
likely to flee in difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a sign of confidence in reformed economies, say
officials and many economists.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. The fact that such direct investment accounted
for 97 percent of net private capital inflows to Latin America last
year showed that ``markets are working poorly, that institutions
are inadequate, and that risks are high,'' argues Ricardo Hausmann,
the IDB's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   In richer economies, he says, investors look for a range of
financial products, and foreign firms may seek local partners
instead of feeling compelled to invest in their own operation.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, if Latin American countries are to avoid fresh
financial panics, they need stronger banking systems, more
developed local capital markets, and better corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   Some governments have recognized this. Brazil proposes to set up
a new financial-services agency to stiffen bank supervision, and
its Congress is discussing new laws to protect minority
shareholders and improve accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is also tightening bank regulation in an effort to
develop a long-term debt market; this year, it has issued
three-year peso bonds, and plans to issue a five-year bond. Mexican
officials hope its Congress will soon pass a new bankruptcy law.
</P>
<P>
   These are encouraging signs. But in general, as Guillermo Perry,
the World Bank's chief economist for Latin America, points out, the
pace of structural reform in the region has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve faster growth and to reduce poverty there need to be
further reforms, of everything from education to labor markets. As
capital flows back into the region, perhaps the biggest danger is
that this week's torpid mood at the IDB meeting signifies
complacency rather than calm. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Microsoft trial is at last coming to an end
_ at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   As court deadlines come and go, the world's biggest software
firm and America's Justice Department are still talking about a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who has presided over the case,
now says that he will give his ruling, which is expected to be hard
on Microsoft, next week or possibly later.
</P>
<P>
   At such a time you might expect Microsoft to be on its best
behavior. Not so, say computer-security experts. They complain that
the company is as reluctant as ever to abandon its much-criticized
business tactic to ``embrace, extend _ and extinguish.''
</P>
<P>
   This bodes ill, they argue, if Microsoft is offered a lenient
settlement or has only modest remedies imposed on it by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is over an encryption technology called Kerberos,
after the three-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades. The
program scrambles passwords travelling on computer networks, so
that they cannot be stolen by eavesdroppers. It is the standard for
identifying users on servers running Unix operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Kerberos gained preeminence because it is clever, and because
its developers, computer scientists at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, released the source code, which let security experts
around the world debug and refine the program line by line.
</P>
<P>
   It has so far proved uncrackable _ a good thing, because
password-sniffing programs are freely available on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Microsoft has ``embraced'' the technology, meaning
that computers running Windows could connect to Unix servers. But
with its new operating system, Windows 2000, the company has
``extended'' Kerberos, making a slight change so that Microsoft's
version is not fully interoperable with the standard version found
at hundreds of universities, financial institutions and other firms
across the world.
</P>
<P>
   This, critics say, is an attempt to ``extinguish'' a public
standard, to help Windows become the dominant operating system on
servers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Given Microsoft's version of Kerberos, they argue, IT managers
have an incentive to opt for an all-Windows network. That is
because users will find it easier to log on and gain access to all
the features of the new operating system if both PCs and servers
run Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways around this problem. Network administrators can
write patches that get the two systems to work together.
</P>
<P>
   CyberSafe, a commercial Kerberos vendor, now sells ActiveTRUST,
which purports to help. But such solutions are complicated and
expensive. And since Microsoft's source code is secret, outside
software developers cannot debug it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it has done nothing wrong. It asserts that it has
only made use of a feature in a new version of the Kerberos
standard that is currently being drafted, and is not trying to
undercut the existing standard.
</P>
<P>
   The company also says it will soon make public the details
behind its flavor of Kerberos. However, the Kerberos story fits
nicely with the future that Bill Gates described when he resigned
in mid-January as Microsoft's chief executive to become its chief
software architect.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to turn Windows into an operating system for the
Internet, creating a ``walled garden'' in which devices running on
Windows work best with servers powered by Windows _ and thereby to
keep all the firm's competitors out.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this grand vision, called ``New Generations Windows
Services,'' Microsoft will have to ``extend'' the existing
standards of the Internet, just as it has with Kerberos.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the first time that Microsoft has tried to gain
ownership of standards. In the mid-1990s it modified Java, a
popular programming language originally developed by Sun
Microsystems, a technology firm, so that programs written in Java
would run best on Windows PCs.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that, in the current antitrust case, the Department of
Justice is nervous about a settlement or a remedy that falls short
of a breakup (an option that seems increasingly unlikely).
</P>
<P>
   After government lawyers last negotiated a settlement with
Microsoft, in 1995, the firm still felt free to bundle its Internet
browsing software with Windows _ a central issue in the current
case. The DOJ does not want to be outmaneuvered again. &QL;

   WARSAW _ The Polish diplomat reaches for the telephone and
listens, eyebrows arched. ``Sorry,'' he says, cupping the receiver,
``it's our ambassador in Moscow. Another protest.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry Russians, it turns out, are assailing the Polish Embassy
with unsavory chants. Such as? ``Oh, the usual. Poland is the whore
of NATO, that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Russo-Polish relations these days are pretty chilly. In January,
the Polish government kicked out nine Russian diplomats for spying
on its armed forces. Russia responded by expelling nine Poles.
</P>
<P>
   In February, anti-Chechen war protesters, most of them young
Polish anarchists, broke into the Russian Consulate in the Polish
town of Poznan, tore up a Russian flag and daubed the walls with
swastikas.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the Russians right, thought many Poles, apparently
including the police chiefs in Poznan, who then had to be sacked
for dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, blustering in response and using language that suggested
Poland was still an errant Soviet satellite rather than an
independent nation moving towards entry into the European Union,
recalled its ambassador and declared Poland a ``nest'' for
pro-Chechen interests.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Poles are hopeful that Vladimir Putin, Russia's
new president, will help to improve relations. Privately, several
leading Poles in the government say they fear that Putin is a
``Chekist (old secret-service) neo-imperialist,'' strong on state
control and weak on democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly the sort of Russian, in other words, to remind Poles
that Russian troops were on their soil for most of the past three
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Coddled since last year within NATO, Poles no longer fear a
direct Russian invasion. A senior Polish defense official says that
Russia's Baltic military enclave of Kaliningrad, which abuts
Poland, poses ``no threat at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that Putin could oversee a more thoroughgoing union
between Russia and Belarus, on Poland's eastern border, sends a few
Polish pulses racing, though a lot of Poles also think it would be
good if Russia's new president were to cut Belarus's eccentric
leader, Alexander Lukashenka, whom most Poles despise, down to
size.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Putin's ascendancy brings Poland's (and soon the
EU's) eastern border into sharper focus.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Poland's negotiations for getting into the EU, the
Polish government and the European Commission in Brussels have
already been discussing how to handle the border issue.
</P>
<P>
   Some Poles talk of a new ``Belgian curtain'' replacing the old
iron one.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's biggest fear is that Putin will drag Ukraine, which
Poles consider a ``strategic partner,'' back into the Russian fold.
</P>
<P>
   Having Ukraine on the wrong side of the Belgian curtain would be
a disaster for Poland, says Bronislaw Geremek, Poland's foreign
minister. ``A westward-looking Ukraine,'' he says, ``is the best
guarantee of regional stability.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ukraine has been a worry. Poland has invested as much as it
can in Ukraine. However, apart from fine words and a joint
peacekeeping battalion, there is little to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Polish businessmen say that doing business there, as in Putin's
Russia, is too dangerous. Leszek Balcerowicz, the Polish finance
minister who has overseen Poland's economic reforms, was in Kiev,
Ukraine's capital, last week, once more urging Ukrainians to
reform.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Warsaw fear that, if Ukraine continues to fail to do so,
it will become dangerously vulnerable to another Russian takeover.
Still, relations between Poland and Russia may improve. The two
countries do share some economic interests. Gazprom, Russia's gas
giant, is Poland's fifth-largest foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
   And some Poles hope that Putin will prove enough of a realist to
start dealing with Poland, a member of NATO and liable to join the
EU in the next six years or so, on a more equal footing. &QL;

   COMSTOCK, NEB. _ At the age of 87, Curtis Dowse is a living link
to Nebraska's past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, Dowse's father, grandfather and some of his neighbors
teamed up to build a house on the windswept Nebraska plains. Like
so many other early structures on the Great Plains, it was made
mostly from sod, the hardy top layer of soil that pioneers found in
abundance as they made their way west.
</P>
<P>
   Dowse lived in his family's sod house (or ``soddy'') until he
was 20, though the home continued to be occupied, off and on, for
several more decades. It was wired for electricity in 1951, though
not connected to running water.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980, the house was empty and deteriorating. For a while, it
even became a temporary home to wayward cattle. At that point,
Comstock's civic leaders realized that they were in danger of
losing a gem.
</P>
<P>
   While Nebraska was once dotted with sod houses, it now has only
about 100 of them in even minimally decent repair. So volunteers
set about restoring the Dowse property.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 3,000 visitors a year make the four-hour drive from Omaha,
trekking through arid cattle country and over a crackling gravel
access road to see the house for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Dowse restoration is only one effort to rescue the sod house
from the ravages of time and technological progress. While no more
than a handful of soddies are still lived in, they continue to loom
large _ and not only in the prairie mythology of Nebraska, Kansas
and the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they occupy a place in the minds of Americans
everywhere, thanks to the prairie literature of Laura Ingalls
Wilder and Willa Cather.
</P>
<P>
   The 180-member National Sod House Society, located in Holdrege,
Neb., sponsors field trips to sod houses, as well as model-building
and essay-writing by local youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   At one time membership in the society was limited to people who
had actually lived in sod houses, but officials have now loosened
the requirements; 95 percent of today's members are still
descendants of those who once lived in a sod house.
</P>
<P>
   When settlers went west, they were faced with 50 million buffalo
and a vast expanse of native grassland _ yet precious little wood
for building.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma, wrote Roger Welsch, in his 1991 book, ``Sod
Walls,'' ``had all the markings of a 20th-century science-fiction
story _ a spaceship, stranded on a barren, desert planet with no
available resources except the pilot's hand and mind. But no
20th-century engineer could have solved the problem better.''
</P>
<P>
   The pioneers modified an architectural idea devised by local
Indians and used a plough known as a sodbreaker to slice a few
inches beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Fitted with curved guiderails, the sodbreaker lifted the newly
liberated sod cluster and turned it so that the sod ribbon would
gently plop upside down, ready for settlers to slice it into
individual sections weighing about 100 pounds (45 kg) each.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers would stack brick upon brick of sod _ about an acre's
worth _ until they had a home, then plant crops in the rich
undersoil. A limited amount of wood was typically used to hold up
the roof. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Most houses were of a basic rectangular shape, often set into a
hill to provide stability and save on construction time;
occasionally they were built in more exotic shapes such as octagons
or circles, and in rare cases they even went as high as two
stories.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the sod bricks were arranged without gaps _ to keep
out snakes and rain _ sod houses proved to be surprisingly hardy;
indeed, it is usually lack of upkeep rather than age that dooms
most sod houses to collapse. That's because the native flora,
largely buffalo grass and big blue stem grass, is notable for
sinking unusually intertwined roots. &QL;

<P>
   With their thick walls, sod houses kept occupants cool in the
summer and warm in the winter; they even offered good protection
against tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   It is no longer easy to build a sod house, though that didn't
stop Merle Block from trying it himself about a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Block, who manages a Pony Express station in Gothenburg, Neb.,
decided to build a sod house of his own after studying letters from
his ancestors, who came from Germany, and those of his wife Linda,
from Sweden. Both families had lived in sod houses when they
arrived in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at a collection of settlers' photographs taken in the
late 1800s by Solomon Butcher, whose work is by far the most
important documentary tool for sod-house researchers. After finding
a plot of virgin prairie grass on his father's land, Block began to
build.
</P>
<P>
   It took him and a 16-year-old neighbor three weeks to pile 1,400
pieces of sod _ in all, 78 tons of material _ into a house of less
than 200 square feet (18 square metres) with walls that were three
feet thick.
</P>
<P>
   He painted the walls with a mixture of lime to retard crumbling
and hung muslin on the ceiling to catch falling dirt, just as the
settlers did.
</P>
<P>
   The roof, which is made largely of dirt as well, began with one
small cactus planted in it. Now it's a virtual jungle which settled
spontaneously and grew rapidly in the rich soil.
</P>
<P>
   Located off Interstate 80 next to a gas station and a motel, the
sod house is hardly in a ``natural'' environment. But Block decided
to build it in a place where tourists could easily visit.
</P>
<P>
   Now known as the Sod House Museum, it is open to the public six
months a year and attracts nearly 60,000 visitors. The museum has
even received groups _ such as one from Colorado _ seeking Block's
advice on building their own. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The National Sod House Society promotes conservation but lacks
the funds to do so effectively. Block does not live in his sod
house though he has brought his grandchildren, nieces and nephews
to spend the night on beds with corn-husk mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their first question was, `Where is the television?' The
second was, `Where are the lights?'''
</P>
<P>
   Which might help explain why the settlers of the 1880s and 1890s
opted to build wood-frame houses as soon as the railroads made
lumber cost-effective. &QL;

   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The Confederate flag flying on the dome of
South Carolina's State House is not visible from Francis Burns
United Methodist Church, which sits in a black middle-class
neighborhood in north Columbia. But for the 250 blacks and a
handful of whites who gathered there recently for one of a series
of ``unity rallies,'' it is an omnipresent eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dodged bullets in the U.S. military for 22 years,'' says
James Glover, a local preacher, ``and then I come home to see a
flag that oppresses me flying over the State House.''
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton recently advocated the flag's removal,
likening the controversy to ethnic hatred in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP), by way of protest, has already organized a campaign
against tourism to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Now it plans another round of economic sanctions, which might
include exhortations to black consumers to boycott the products of
some of the big global companies that have come to the state,
including BMW, Hitachi, Hoechst, Michelin and Fuji, for implicitly
endorsing the flag. Posters have gone up saying ``Boycott Michelin
tires and BMW cars.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 2, a five-day protest march will begin, from Charleston
to Columbia, complete with local celebrities and Democrat
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A state which used to regard itself as a model of the new South
(witness all those impressive investors) has once again been
ensnared by the politics of the old South.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has had a rough press lately. In March, the
legislature refused to approve an official Martin Luther King
holiday, leaving South Carolina as the only state in the nation
without one.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s there was a long, unsuccessful battle to keep women
out of South Carolina's military college.
</P>
<P>
   And, in case you missed it, there was the recent Republican
primary, which got the state accused of conservative dirty tricks
and Neanderthal views on everything from interracial dating to
religious tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   A state that once wanted to be compared to other entrepreneurial
hubs like California now finds itself in less flattering company.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals mutter about their ``pariah state'' being just like
Austria in the wake of the rise of that country's far-right Freedom
Party. Black ministers compare the ``spiritual apartheid'' in South
Carolina to that of the old South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, one Washington pundit has called South Carolina
``the Mississippi of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is embarrassing for a state that prided itself on the
peaceful integration of its schools, universities and public places
during the civil rights era (unlike neighboring North Carolina,
Alabama, and Mississippi).
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's tourism industry has thrived by stressing the
state's friendly people, lovely beaches and elegant antebellum
cities, rather than Fort Sumter (the first engagement of the Civil
War).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is distressing'', says John West, the moderate governor of
South Carolina from 1971 to 1975, ``that the reputation we built
with a lot of blood, sweat and tears is being diminished if not
destroyed. It makes you want to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fruits of that reputation are now in danger of
souring. The NAACP is discussing whether black students should
boycott the state's universities.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming 17-day annual Spoleto arts festival in Charleston,
a talismanic event ever since the state first won the right to
stage it back in 1977, has lost a main attraction, the Bill T.
Jones Dance Company, in deference to the NAACP boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism industry has lost an estimated $30 million. An
unnamed big foreign investor is said to have been scared away.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every business leader, and most of the state's
educational and civic ones, has either publicly or privately urged
the politicians to get rid of the flag. Recent polls show that most
South Carolinians want the flag removed.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it still fluttering? Psychological history takes part
of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the Civil War, not to mention suffering dreadfully for
decades afterwards, is still part of (white) folklore. Confederate
monuments are sprinkled throughout Dixie like kudzu, and frequent
reenactments of Civil War battles are enormously popular.
</P>
<P>
   To many whites, the Confederacy was a romantic lost cause and
had nothing to do with slavery.
</P>
<P>
   A more prosaic reason is the redistricting of the state
legislature. In a piece of crude gerrymandering after the 1990
census, white Republicans and black Democrats struck a deal,
increasing the number of seats with clear white or black
majorities.
</P>
<P>
   So some white state politicians feel no pressure to reflect
statewide opinion; they simply have to please their constituents,
many of whom are pro-flag. And some black ones feel pressure from
their constituents not to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, when South Carolina was run by more
moderate whites who made a point of consulting black politicians on
racially sensitive issues, a backroom deal would have been quickly
done.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal, put forth by the Democratic governor, Jim
Hodges, involves taking the flag off the dome and putting a square
version _ like that carried by the Army of Northern Virginia rather
than South Carolina's rectangular version _ in the State House
grounds, beside the statue of a Confederate general. It has been
rejected by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   While the negotiations drag on, South Carolina risks becoming
the place where the Civil War began, and hasn't yet ended. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Appearances are, of course, deceptive. Sensible observers of
British politics do not read too much into Prime Minister Tony
Blair's perpetually goofy grin or into the gloomy scowl so often
fixed to the face of Gordon Brown, his finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Blair is known to be serious, and Brown has been seen
to laugh. But what of Laurent Fabius, appointed this week by the
French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, to be his third finance
minister in less than five months?
</P>
<P>
   Fabius's natural expression is a self-satisfied smirk. Perhaps
it, too, is misleading. Or perhaps not, given that the elegant
Fabius has long had a lot to smirk about.
</P>
<P>
   There are the usual badges of France's best and brightest: a
spell at the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA), membership of
the omniscient Council of State, a fast track into parliament (as a
Socialist) and then into government.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, there is the unique honor handed to him in 1984
by President Francois Mitterrand: appointment, at the age of 37, as
France's youngest prime minister of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Fabius seemed destined, one day, to become France's
first Jewish president. That is still entirely possible. But Fabius
has learned from bitter experience that the gods delight in
humbling the precocious.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-year tenure as prime minister he was competent
enough at stopping the nationalizing excesses of the early
Mitterrand years. Yet outside France his term is more often
remembered for the Rainbow Warrior affair, when French
secret-service agents blew up a Greenpeace ship berthed in New
Zealand _ and by accident killed a crewman.
</P>
<P>
   Inside France, it is remembered for the ``blood affair,'' when
the national transfusion service, by refusing to use an
American-invented screening process (while waiting for a French
one) knowingly supplied AIDS-contaminated blood to hemophiliacs, of
whom around a thousand have so far died as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius, charged in 1994 with ultimate responsibility for the
affair, was cleared by a special court only last year.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that acquittal, the skeptics doubted that Fabius would
again seize the political spotlight. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 350) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was no longer first secretary of the Socialist Party, a post
he had held twice before; his only role in national politics was
largely honorific, as speaker of the National Assembly; and, worst
of all, power in the Socialist camp had passed to Lionel Jospin,
his rival ever since they were competing courtiers in the kingdom
of Mitterrand. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Fabius was yesterday's man, despite a
sympathy-grabbing autobiography (``The Wounds of Truth'') and the
boost to his energies that followed the court acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   So why have the gods, or at least Jospin, suddenly smiled on him
again?
</P>
<P>
   One reason was Fabius's availability. His boredom with the
National Assembly was such that last December, when Germany's first
mooted candidate to head the IMF was being met with universal
dismay, he floated his own willingness to succeed Michel Camdessus
in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer arrogance? One would expect nothing less from an enarque,
as ENA's graduates are known; and in any event Fabius, formerly a
budget minister and an industry minister as well as a prime
minister, had good qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason is that Jospin knows that Fabius will bring a
balance to the government that it has lacked ever since Dominique
Strauss-Kahn resigned last November to fight charges of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``DSK,'' but unlike the hapless Christian Sautter, who has
been summarily turfed out to make room for Fabius, the new finance
minister talks the unSocialist (and unJospinist) language of
deregulation, share options for managers, even _ horrors! _ the
virtues of private pension funds. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As long ago as 1985, in a book addressed to his sons, Thomas and
Victor, the young prime minister had declared that ``socialism can
be modern, faithful without being dogmatic, open without being
opportunistic, a way identified with efficiency and freedoms,'' and
that he himself was ``a socialist of the possible.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the French press admiringly compares him to Tony
Blair. And no wonder the French stock market rose on the news of
his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   But it is tempting to offer a third reason for Fabius's summons:
that Jospin thinks he will be less of a threat inside his cabinet
than outside. After all, a minister is bound to support his
colleagues; a party heavyweight with no government address is not.
</P>
<P>
   Last August Fabius witheringly informed Le Monde that ``the left
runs few risks of being beaten by the right, but could manage it
with taxes and social charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the government's nest egg of surplus tax revenues
has become embarrassingly large, so Fabius has emphasized the need
for lower tax rates for all classes, including the rich.
</P>
<P>
   With political friends like Fabius, the prime minister may have
wondered, who needs enemies? In which case, it makes good sense to
use the power of patronage to muzzle an eloquent critic.
</P>
<P>
   But, apart from ministerial trappings and the bright light of
television, what does Fabius get in return for biting his tongue?
</P>
<P>
   The obvious answer is that two years from now, when Jospin,
determined to deny the conservative Jacques Chirac a second term,
runs for the presidency, Fabius will once again become prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the prospect is plausible, both because the economy
is growing fast and because Jospin, despite his rhetorical
insistence (repeated this week) that his is a reforming government,
has clearly decided not to incite the public-sector unions, the
Socialists' bedrock, by pushing too hard for the changes so badly
needed in health care, taxes and education.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a less obvious answer, inherently appealing to any
courtier of the Machiavellian Mitterrand. What happens if things go
less well for the economy, if the right eventually gets its act
together, and if Jospin's coalition then loses the parliamentary
election due (assuming the calendar remains unchanged) to be called
just a couple of months before the presidential contest?
</P>
<P>
   In a trice Jospin would no longer be his party's hero, but its
scapegoat. And who would replace him as the party's presidential
candidate? Destiny would surely then beckon Fabius. &QL;

<P>
   Like a revived West End musical of 30 years ago, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been
brought back to the center stage in Vienna. The plot's the same.
Indeed half the cast of oil ministers remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   As the demand for oil rises, will the Middle East producers hold
back production and keep prices up? Or will America, in the name of
the consumer, force its Arab allies to open up the taps again to
appease voters' anger in gas-guzzling America?
</P>
<P>
   Or will the radicals, led by Iran, keep the valves turned down?
</P>
<P>
   And the denouement this time? Well, roughly the same as the ones
we got used to on the last run: a messy compromise of partially
increased production, renewed threats of a squeeze should prices
fall too fast, and Iran sulking in the corner declaring the whole
thing a neo-imperialist plot by America.
</P>
<P>
   Having driven the price up nearly 300 percent by cutting
production by 1.7 million barrels a day six months ago, OPEC is now
saying that it will bring it down again by restoring those cuts _
but not so much as to let it fall below $20 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   As a performance it doesn't match the full sound and fury of the
original performance in the 1973/4 oil crisis. Times are different.
</P>
<P>
   The world _ outside of America _ has learned to curb its use of
oil for transport and move from oil to gas for heating and
electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC can tighten a tightening market but it can't reverse it or
change long-term trends. The harder it squeezes now, the faster the
move to alternatives, as the big exporters such as Saudi Arabia
well know.
</P>
<P>
   Cartels have a poor history of survival. No group can fine-tune
as volatile a market as oil. And OPEC is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   But OPEC, while hardly high-minded and certainly not estimable,
is saying something of importance to western economies at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   For all the remorseless logic of free markets, oil remains a
peculiar and highly political commodity so long as the world's
demand for oil imports has to be met by a small number of exporters
(including non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Norway) whose
interest may not lie in promoting unlimited production.
</P>
<P>
   To grow, the world needs cheap energy. But when it grows as fast
as America has, then it hits the buffers of OPEC dependence.
</P>
<P>
   If the world wants rid of dependence on OPEC, and if American
politicians want to avoid rising gas prices in the run-up to
elections, the answer is in their hands: Cut consumption and
promote alternatives to the car culture. &QL;

IN RARE MOVE, CHINESE NULLIFY STANFORD SCIENTIST'S CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ In a highly unusual judicial reversal, the Beijing
High People's Court has nullified the conviction of a Chinese-born
Stanford University scientist who has been in prison for more than
two years for ``revealing state secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Hua Di, a Chinese citizen who is a permanent resident of the
United States, was arrested on a visit to China in January 1998,
his first in nearly a decade. Hua, a former Chinese missile
scientist, was sentenced to 15 years in prison by the Beijing
Number One Intermediate Court late last year for making public in
his writing in the United States disclosures about China's military
program.
</P>
<P>
   But the High Court last month found that the evidence presented
to the Intermediate Court did not warrant the conviction and
ordered the lower court to retry the case, family members who
recently received notice of the reversal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notice we got from the Beijing High Court said that `some
of the facts were unclear,''' said Wu Sanbao, Hua's sister. ``I
don't think that means the whole verdict has been overturned _
maybe that's going too far. But the court said it must go back to
the Intermediate Court for retrial.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and legal experts said the reversal was unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in recent memory we could recall the
High Court overruling a lower court in a politically sensitive
case,'' said a western diplomat in Beijing, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But while some of the experts saw the judicial review as a sign
of China's developing legal system, others suggested that it was a
political calculation designed to improve China's image at a time
when it is seeking to join the World Trade Organization and to
avoid censure at an upcoming human rights meeting in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has repeatedly brought up Hua's case, until
now to no effect. Hua's colleagues at Stanford University have
contended that all of the information that Hua discussed in his
articles was already publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   On retrial, Hua could be convicted again, convicted of a lesser
crime that required little or no further jail time or fully
exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this review is a good sign, and it looks like the
judicial process is operating,'' said Jerome Cohen, a New York
lawyer who recently represented Song Yongyi, another U.S.-based
scholar imprisoned in China earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he noted that decisions are ``very opaque in such
security cases'' and that it was impossible to say how much the
decision was influenced by political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of great political sensitivity, and I'm sure
that political factors played some role,'' he said. ``There would
have had to be consultation with city, party and central legal
committees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese judiciary is not independent, and defendants are
often convicted in trials where in practice they have few rights _
particularly if their crimes are political in nature. They are
sometimes not allowed to have access to lawyers or to speak in
their own defense, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But China has also taken great efforts to reform its legal
system in recent years, writing new laws and training thousands of
lawyers. As this new legal consciousness has taken hold, legal
experts say, the system is slowly becoming more concerned with
justice and less with political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   The case was sent back to the Intermediate Court according to a
clause in China's Criminal Procedure Code, which took effect in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The legal turn of events seemed to take Hua's supporters by
surprise. Some had anticipated that Hua, who suffers from a rare
form of male breast cancer, might be released on medical grounds.
Chinese authorities have frequently released jailed dissidents to
the United States on medical parole as a political gesture of good
will or once their cases became politically embarrassing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wu, Hua's sister, said she had not seen her brother for more
than two years, since his arrest, and did not know ``whether he's
suffered any relapses or not.'' But she said that ``he hasn't been
getting the radiation therapy he was getting before.''
</P>
<P>
   Hua is being held in a Beijing State Security Detention Center,
his relatives said, the same one that earlier this year held the
other American academic, Song Yongyi.
</P>
<P>
   Song, a Chinese-born researcher at Dickinson College in
Pennsylvania, was jailed for purchasing original materials from
China's Cultural Revolution period _ materials that are widely
available in bookstores and street markets.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities granted his release only after saying that
he had ``confessed to his crimes'' and informed on others involved
in similar misdeeds. He has steadfastly denied all charges. He was
returned to the United States after a campaign by academics and
congressmen to secure his release.

   MICROSOFT-RULING (Washington) _ U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson announces he will rule at 5 p.m. today on whether

   CENSUS-RESTRUCTURING (Washington) _ The Southeastern Legal

say New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani violated the privacy of a man

   RAHOVEC, SOUTHWEST KOSOVO _ The wine was red and, though it was
chilled, as Qamil Cena poured from the clear, unlabelled bottle,
its fragrance leapt from the glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is from 1992. It is made from the Merlot grape,'' said
Cena. ``It is one of our best wines.'' The year 1992 may have been
an excellent vintage for the wine-makers of southern Kosovo, but it
was also the year in which Cena, a trained agriculturist, was
forced from his job.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of Kosovar Albanians, 36-year-old Cena _ a
manager with the state-owned Orvin wine company _ lost out as the
authorities filled key positions across Kosovo with Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years scrabbling to make a living, he returned to
work last summer in the aftermath of the war. Now, nine months on,
Cena and thousands of other Kosovar Albanians are back in their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In such circumstances the renamed winery is now preparing to
make what may be its most memorable vintage yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speak for myself. After I finished my studies I
started working here. Of course (this year) is important,'' said
Cena. ``We don't plan to have any special name for the wine but
that could come later. First we have to produce the grapes and then
we can think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry of southern Kosovo, where often the vineyards
appear to run to the horizon, has always been important and the
wines of Orvin were traditionally considered the best.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, up to 80 percent of the wine the company
produced _ including Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir,
Chardonnay and Riesling _ was exported. It was a huge foreign
currency earner for the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then. Although the Albanian workers have taken
control of the winery, calling it by the less than rounded mouthful
of the Agricultural and Industrial Enterprise of Rahovec (NBI
Rahoveci), the future is beset by problems.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the situation last year, in which the entire crop was
lost, people were not able to work the vines. As a result they
expect only 30-40 percent of their 3,500 hectares (8,650 acres) of
vineyards to produce grapes for this year's pressing.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the shortage of materials. The 600 workers are
short of fertilizer and herbicide. With the exception of the wine
labels, which they produce themselves, everything else _ the
bottles, the corks, the barrels of Croatian oak in which the wine
is aged for a minimum of two years _ have to be imported.
</P>
<P>
   To add to their difficulties, last winter was one of the coldest
in living memory and many of the vines were killed. A small area of
the vineyards still cannot be entered because land mines remain,
left by the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   But the enterprise _ its wage bill now being paid by the United
Nations, which has formally assumed ownership of all former
state-owned companies _ cannot afford to fail.
</P>
<P>
   While 600 people are employed directly by the plant, up to
30,000 people are involved in the region's wine industry. Many of
these are employed on an ad hoc basis _ helping with the harvest in
September and October _ but others own the privately-held vineyards
which make up two-thirds of the total acreage providing grapes for
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Among these owners are Bahtiar and Gazmend Tara, two brothers
who were cutting back the dead wood on their three hectares (7 1/2
acres) of vines. Their family of 11 depends on the grapes and other
produce they can grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really hope for much of a harvest,'' said Bahtiar,
his fingers furiously working a pair of secateurs as a snow storm
blew down the valley. ``Everything was frozen this winter so we
don't expect great results. We will have to wait until next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers at Rahovec believe their future could lie in
restoring the export agreements that Orvin had with a number of
European countries, particularly Germany. The plant's director,
Aqim Hasku, spends much of his time trying to achieve this.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, for the workers at the plant, spring is a busy
time of the year and they intend to go on doing what they have done
for many years: growing grapes, making wine. &QL;

   HOLLYWOOD _ Something very odd is happening to the image of
Tinseltown's leading man.
</P>
<P>
   Just take a look at the list of best-actor nominees at this
year's Oscar ceremony. Of the five, only Denzel Washington is true
matinee-idol material. The others, not so long ago, would have been
placed firmly in the category of character actors, not leads.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey may have a fascinating face but he is nobody's idea
of a classic good-looker; Russell Crowe is way too tortured and
angst-ridden to have carried the Hollywood blockbusters of old; as
for Richard Farnsworth, at 79 the oldest nominee ever, he has been
stuck with bit parts his whole career until now.
</P>
<P>
   But where the character actors are triumphing, the more
conventional leading men seem by contrast to be treading water or
even floundering badly.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Ford suffered a big-budget bomb last year (``Random
Hearts'') and has dropped out of the lead in Steven Soderbergh's
upcoming drug-trade movie, ``Traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicholson has not worked in three years. Leonardo DiCaprio
made heavy weather of choosing his lead role in ``The Beach,'' only
a modest box-office success, and is now agonizing once again over
what he should do next.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis had a better year, thanks to the runaway success of
``The Sixth Sense,'' but that was a shoestring project he picked
for love of the craft. His supposed blockbuster, ``The Story of
Us,'' co-starring Michelle Pfeiffer, fizzled and died in a few
short weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most successful of Hollywood's A-list men last year
was Tom Cruise, but that success came largely by breaking the
A-list rules.
</P>
<P>
   First he took 14 months out to appear in Stanley Kubrick's
``Eyes Wide Shut'' _ hardly mainstream material, despite the big
marketing push from Warner Bros. _ then he took a massive cut in
pay to play a macho sex guru in P.T. Anderson's distinctly arty
ensemble piece ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   As Peter Bart, the editor-in-chief of the trade-bible Variety,
wrote recently, ``No one's taking up a collection for unemployed
superstars, but their absence reminds us of a phenomenon that has
agents and studio executives worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when Hollywood, more than ever, depends on
star-driven vehicles, it's getting harder to put the stars together
with the vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Is all this just coincidence? Or the result of Hollywood's
well-known propensity for unpredictability? Or is it the sign of
something more significant?
</P>
<P>
   One clear consequence of the loss of direction in the mainstream
is the quirky, refreshingly original, often subversive nature of
this year's Oscar-nominated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it would be a mistake to declare the star system dead _
just look at Tom Hanks, who has hardly put a foot wrong in years,
or Julia Roberts, who can score a hit whether her films are good
(like the sassy legal drama ``Erin Brockovich'' which just opened
in the U.S.), so-so (``Notting Hill''), or awful (``Runaway
Bride'').
</P>
<P>
   But true stars like these are increasingly rare, their number
and reliability rarely justifying the monstrously large paychecks
they receive.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing feeling at the big studios that the A-list
has largely priced itself out of the market. Cost-cutting is the
watchword everywhere these days, and memories of Demi Moore's
bloated $12 million payday for a stinker such as ``Striptease'' are
still fresh in many minds.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, this superstar warp effect didn't matter because
audiences seemed to respond to big names, big action and big
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``high concept'' movie, which should have been
called the low-concept movie because it consisted of an idea that
could be rendered in 25 words or less, was the crowning triumph of
the industry deal-makers in the 1980s, but also the near-death of
cinema as an art form.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons of cost, audience fatigue and increased artistic
ambition, the high-concept movie nowadays seems to be on the way
out. The likes of ``Godzilla,'' ``Armageddon,'' ``Wild Wild West''
and the latter-day Batman films have barely justified their
dizzying price tags in box-office returns.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a leading lieutenant of Dreamworks SKG's Jeffrey
Katzenberg, one of the inventors of the genre, even went so far as
to declare that ``the high-concept movie is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign of the times, Disney is embarking on its
forthcoming grand spectacle ``Pearl Harbor'' with a financing plan
more common to low-budget independent movies: it is asking
everyone, from director to crew, to agree to work on deferred
payments, which is to say their salaries will only be made up in
full if the film is a success. &QL;

in the U.S.), so-so (``Notting Hill''), or awful (``Runaway
Bride'').
</P>
<P>
   But true stars like these are increasingly rare, their number
and reliability rarely justifying the monstrously large paychecks
they receive.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing feeling at the big studios that the A-list
has largely priced itself out of the market. Cost-cutting is the
watchword everywhere these days, and memories of Demi Moore's
bloated $12 million payday for a stinker such as ``Striptease'' are
still fresh in many minds.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, this superstar warp effect didn't matter because
audiences seemed to respond to big names, big action and big
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``high concept'' movie, which should have been
called the low-concept movie because it consisted of an idea that
could be rendered in 25 words or less, was the crowning triumph of
the industry deal-makers in the 1980s, but also the near-death of
cinema as an art form.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons of cost, audience fatigue and increased artistic
ambition, the high-concept movie nowadays seems to be on the way
out. The likes of ``Godzilla,'' ``Armageddon,'' ``Wild Wild West''
and the latter-day Batman films have barely justified their
dizzying price tags in box-office returns.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a leading lieutenant of Dreamworks SKG's Jeffrey
Katzenberg, one of the inventors of the genre, even went so far as
to declare that ``the high-concept movie is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign of the times, Disney is embarking on its
forthcoming grand spectacle ``Pearl Harbor'' with a financing plan
more common to low-budget independent movies: it is asking
everyone, from director to crew, to agree to work on deferred
payments, which is to say their salaries will only be made up in
full if the film is a success. &QL;

<P>
   A couple thousand years after Greece supplied a name for the
continent, Europe is about to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, when the euro likely replaces the Greek drachma, the
European Central Bank and its official interest-rate policy will
effectively rule the Greek economy, ending a history of inflation
and financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign lenders will sleep more soundly knowing they will be
repaid in euros, rather than drachmas. And Greek companies, which
used to pay double-digit interest rates on loans _ ten years ago,
Greece's inflation rate soared to 24 percent _ will soon be able to
borrow at lower rates than U.S. firms.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's recently hiked Greece's credit rating two
rungs, to A-. The benefits have already shown up in the Athens
stock index, which rose fourfold between January 1997 and January
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most Europeans opposed Greece's entry into the
European Monetary Union. If a volatile Greece joined EMU, the fear
was a Trojan Horse of economic woes might sneak inside Euroland:
exploding debt, rampant inflation, and widening deficits. Countries
such as Germany and France might get stuck bailing out Greece
during its next budget crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year, Greece has allayed these worries by
successfully fighting fiscal and monetary excess. The budget
deficit has been reduced from 15 percent of gross domestic product
in 1990 to about 1.5 percent; inflation has fallen from 20 percent
to 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greece has also jumped on the privatization bandwagon, selling
stakes in the National Bank of Greece and in the Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization, the biggest telephone firm.
</P>
<P>
   These sales raked in millions of dollars and helped push down
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   This year looks like another good one, with GDP rising to 3.5
percent, higher than most of Europe. That's a good thing for the
ruling Panhellenic Socialist Party (PASOK), for it must hold an
election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Greeks have become accustomed to a raging stock
market, PASOK is waiting for stock prices to rebound from a slump
in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to Greek newspapers, the benchmark stock index must
return to the lofty 6000 level before PASOK will hold general
elections. (The index peaked at 6188 in September 1999 and sat
around 5100 in mid-January.)
</P>
<P>
   Without a guard as vigilant as the Securities and Exchange
Commission, you can't rule out some stock manipulation to get
prices up to the target. It's a dangerous game, but PASOK might
find it's more dangerous to lose the election.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether the party pulls off a victory or not, Greece will
join the EMU, since the opposition New Democracy Party also
supports entry.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear the good wishes of other countries that want
to follow the Greek lead. The Czechs, Hungarians, and Poles all
imagine themselves carrying euros in the next five years. Even
Turkey sees itself joining the EMU.
</P>
<P>
   Could Greece ever abide this? Yes, because in order to
demonstrate the good behavior required for its own membership,
Greece had to act the better neighbor. So in December the
government, led by Costas Simitis, officially accepted Turkey as a
``candidate'' for the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   With EMU entry no longer a pipe dream for Turkey and the like,
speculators may begin snapping up ``emerging Europe'' equities with
as much enthusiasm as they've done with those in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the cheers going, remember that Athens will host the
2004 Olympics. That will bring plenty of tourists and foreign
currency. Even if Greece wins no relay races or wrestling matches,
she will be a big winner in the spectacle. &QL;

 &HT;    MICROSOFT JUDGE REGARDED AS TOUGH BUT FAIR
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At an early stage of federal antitrust action
against Microsoft Corp., when the company insisted that the Windows
95 operating system wouldn't work without its Internet browser,
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson decided to find out for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   With help from a courtroom technician, the judge was able to
``uninstall'' his own Explorer Internet browser in about 90
seconds. With that, Jackson ordered the software giant to begin
selling Windows 95 separately from its browser.
</P>
<P>
   While that order was overturned on appeal _ leading eventually
to the Justice Department suit against Microsoft that yielded a
ruling Monday _ Jackson's dive into the technical aspects of the
case is indicative of his approach to law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom calls it like he sees it,'' says James Schaller, his
former law partner at Jackson &AMP; Campbell in Washington. ``That's
his signature. Most people respect him for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before issuing his verdict in the high-profile Microsoft case,
Jackson broke precedent by asking a federal appeals court judge,
Richard Posner of Chicago, to try to settle the case as a private
mediator. When Posner's efforts failed, he praised Jackson for his
bold initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 63, is is no newcomer to the national spotlight. The
burly white-haired judge was appointed to the bench in 1982 by
President Reagan. In 1991, he sent former Washington, D.C., Mayor
Marion Barry to jail for cocaine possession. Three years later, he
ordered former Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., to turn over sex-filled
diary entries to a Senate Ethics Committee. And in 1997, he fined
Reagan's former aide Michael Deaver $100,000 for lying about
lobbying activities.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's Washington roots run deep. He grew up in the city's
affluent suburbs, attending the exclusive St. Albans School. He
sang for the Washington Cathedral Choir.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to Dartmouth College. Upon graduation, he joined the
U.S. Navy as a line officer, spending three years aboard a
destroyer in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. He returned to Harvard
University Law School, graduating in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Washington, Jackson worked with his father, Thomas
Searing Jackson, a well-known Washington lawyer, at a predecessor
firm to Jackson &AMP; Campbell. The father of two grown daughters, he
loves sailing and spends weekends in St. Mary's County, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In the hallways of the U.S. District Court, prosecutors and
defense attorneys say Jackson is an affable, able judge who runs a
tight ship. A former litigator, he's considerate of the time
pressures on overworked lawyers. Also, he's been known to show
compassion for those sentenced. One defense attorney recalls
Jackson using flexibility in sentencing a former military medic who
served in Panama. The reason: The man had served his country during
war without a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jackson is not without critics. The gossipy
Washingtonian magazine lambasted him in 1996, calling him one of
Washington's worst judges. In 1995, the trade publication Legal
Times took him to task for moving slowly and calling long lunch
breaks. A 1993 Legal Times analysis showed that his reversal rate
was about 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Former clerks describe the judge as a warm, mentoring boss who
takes a personal interest in their lives. But no one denies he has
a tough side. Jackson repeatedly has gone head-to-head with
Microsoft. Following the browser incident, he threatened the
company's lawyers with contempt sanctions because he said they
defamed a court- appointed expert, Lawrence Lessig. Following a
Microsoft appeal, Lessig stepped down as the court's special master
in the case.

&HT;     FORMER MOVER AT APPLE NOW PUMPS MONEY INTO TECH START-UPS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Note optional trim)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SRACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Seven years after he left Apple Computer Inc.,
John Sculley is still chasing the technology dream, jet-setting
around the globe looking for that next killer app.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple, is now a venture
capitalist, trading the political intrigue of the boardroom for the
thrill of the hunt. He has replaced one Apple with another in the
process, founding Sculley Brothers LLC, a low-profile venture
capital company based in his hometown of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside his brothers, Arthur and David, Sculley has helped
launch 25 companies to date, all of them in the technology
business. The companies run the gamut of e-commerce, including
business-to-consumer Web sites like Buy.com and More.com, and
business-to-business exchanges like BigMachines.com and TechEx.
</P>
<P>
   He is splitting his time between the two coasts these days,
visiting the San Francisco area about once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this as three brothers, working with people we
like, focusing on a few themes which tie back into our marketing
and operating backgrounds,'' said Sculley, reclining in a Fairmont
Hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brothers and I have all held general management positions
in large companies. We try to always partner with first-tier
investors. Our role is largely business development, opening doors,
putting together partnerships, bringing in money, recruiting
management. It's not an awful lot different than the big venture
companies, but just on a smaller scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Sculley, 61, is high on business-to-business enterprises,
shunning any mention of the business-to-consumer space he and most
other financiers were falling over each other to fund just a few
short months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focused on several themes, like B2B exchanges,'' Sculley
said, referring to business-to-business companies. ``We're also
focused on B2B services and customer relationship management. We're
trying to be one of the enablers to transform the old economy into
the new economy, but we're doing it in a very low-profile way. We
don't want a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a big change for a man who has made a career out of
getting the attention of consumers. In his salad days in the 1980s,
Sculley was considered by many to be the best marketing chief
executive in the world. First at Pepsi, then at Apple, Sculley
earned his reputation with hard work and impressive results.
</P>
<P>
   During his 16 years in a number of marketing and management
positions at Pepsi, Sculley helped lead the company past archrival
Coke by the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   At Apple, where he served as chief executive from 1983 to 1993,
he is largely given credit for the rise in the corporation's
revenues from $600 million per year to more than $8 billion per
year by the time he left. Perhaps most importantly, he brought
big-brand marketing to the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   The transition between the two jobs took place in 1982, when
Sculley was first bitten by the Silicon Valley bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I ever came to Silicon Valley was in 1982.
Steve Jobs and Andy Hertzfeld, one of the original programmers of
the Mac, showed me this bench-top prototype product, which was the
Mac before the Mac,'' said Sculley. ``They had dancing Pepsi cans
on the screens. That's when I first began to realize what was
possible with visualization on a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know what happened then. Jobs convinced Sculley, then the
chief of Pepsi, to stop selling colored sugar water and join Apple
in changing the world. A few years later, Jobs left Apple in a
boardroom coup for which he blamed Sculley. As Jobs put it,
famously, ``I hired the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sculley had given the Apple board of directors an ultimatum at
the time, essentially asking them to choose between him and Jobs.
With his fiery temper and manic management style working against
him, Jobs was out, and Sculley was alone at the top.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming years, the company grew under Sculley. On the
downside, he chose note to license the Mac operating system to
clone makers and gradually lost market share to Microsoft. By 1993,
with product shortages and planning snafus clouding the company's
performance, the board gave Sculley his own set of walking papers,
replacing him with Michael Spindler.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Sculley made one more pass at the executive suite,
taking over the wireless company Spectrum Information Technologies.
It was an ill-fated move that ended with Sculley's suing the
Purchase, N.Y.-based company for withholding information while
recruiting him.
</P>
<P>
   It was after that debacle that he slowly started getting into
the funding game, using his own money to back technology ventures
he liked. Sculley Brothers LLC was born in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   With it grew Sculley's thirst for a repeat performance of his
Apple experience _ another chance to change the world. Visiting San
Francisco with one of his world-changing candidates, it is evident
that Sculley has lost none of the evangelical spark needed to pitch
emerging technology.

</P>
<P>
   His latest protege is a young Israeli named Eyal Gever. Sculley
thinks Gever has hatched another ``insanely great'' idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Eyal is doing in my humble opinion _ and remember, I'm
not a techie, but just a plain old marketing guy _ makes me feel
like I'm witnessing again one of those extraordinary, special
moments where there is the beginning of a platform that
fundamentally changes the way the Internet can be commercialized,
from a publishing model, which I spent 10 years at Apple helping to
promote, to a broadcasting model.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SAN FRANCISCO: xxx a broadcasting model. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyal heads Gizmoz Inc. His company, formerly known as Zapa
Digital Arts, has created Internet infrastructure technology for
broadcasting over the Internet, with an eye on the marketing
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a broadcasting solution for broadcasters,'' Gever said.
``If you look in the dictionary, a gizmo is a surprising,
functional object. I wanted to name it as an object because I
wanted people to collect it and share it.''
</P>
<P>
   The end product is referred to as a gizmo, a 13K Java applet
that can be used to transmit, or broadcast, any number of media
over the Net to a user's computer, where they can be saved, moved,
copied, sent, posted or trashed. Gizmoz is hoping people keep them,
giving marketers a new pipeline into the consumers' home turf.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley declined to reveal his stake in the company. Regardless
of how much, Sculley is sharing that stake with some pretty big
hitters. Stateside, the company's investors include Chase Equity
Associates and AOL Investments. In Israel, two of the country's
biggest tech investment houses, Giza GE Venture Fund and Polaris
Venture Capital, are in.
</P>
<P>
   All these investors are betting that gizmos can revolutionize
the way advertising is done on the Internet. As any Net surfer
knows, banner ads are played out, and few if any Net companies have
been able to turn a profit on that business model. Enter Eyal and
his value-added gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now we've been dependent on banner technology, which
for the first few years was pretty important because it created all
the eyeballs out there,'' Sculley said. ``As we move into
e-commerce being the sweet spot of the Internet today, you've got
to have, as marketers, the ability to send messages that have a lot
more emotion to them. You've got to have the ability to interact
with people much more than banners.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether more emotion equates to more
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich media advertising has been problematic,'' said Jim Nail,
a senior analyst specializing in Internet commerce at Oat Forrester
Research, an Internet research company. ``You've got companies like
Unicast, Enliven and Blue Streak working in this space, but there's
a number of barriers to the adoption of these kinds of
technologies. One is the technology barriers of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second and bigger barrier is the rut that advertisers and
ad agencies are in. They don't understand the capabilities of these
technologies. It takes a different thought process to use these
things effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies Nail refers to _ Unicast, Enliven and Blue Streak
_ basically produce souped-up banner ads that still work on the
principle that users will see the ad, then click-through to a
company's site.
</P>
<P>
   Gizmos, on the other hand, represent a way for companies to take
permanent residence on a consumer's computer, allowing them repeat
visits with different marketing messages. While that sounds great
to marketers, it could defeat the whole business model.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can grab these gizmos and hold onto them on their
personal Web sites or wherever, and the advertisers can still
update and change those messages,'' Nail said. ``Effectively, the
advertisers wouldn't have to pay the media companies and Web sites
for repeat advertising. That could be bad news for both.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those hurdles, Nail feels Sculley's involvement with
Gizmos is nothing but good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he brings to this is enormous connections to the
traditional advertising world and the top brand marketers and
leading advertising spenders,'' Nail said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can open an awful lot of doors for this company. It's a new
idea, and it'll be hard for traditional marketers to wrap their
heads around it. With Sculley, at least they'll listen to the
idea.''

<P>
   Sculley, meanwhile, remains very fond of Apple, openly praising
Jobs for his triumphant return to the company's helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Steve Jobs has done with Apple is one of the
great business success stories of all time,'' Sculley said. ``From
my perspective, I see Steve picking up exactly where he left off in
1995. Only this time, he's a far more experienced, savvy executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is really interesting, having been there when Steve was
there originally, was that he didn't waver from his original
strategy. He took the company right back to the same principles
that he believed in then and obviously believes in now.''
</P>
<P>
   Those same principles, namely finding technology you're
passionate about and driving it to greatness, have stuck with
Sculley. Just the same, he is not itching to get back in the
executive saddle, to the extent he did with Jobs and company back
in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had more fun in my life,'' said Sculley, looking
remarkably calm and rested for a man who is on the go all day.
``There are so many young, talented founders and CEOs that the best
role I could play is to coach and advise a lot of these young
entrepreneurs. Having had the chance to make all the mistakes I
have, they can learn from them.''

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is almost
certain to rule Microsoft violated federal antitrust law. The big
shoe to fall will be the penalty stage of the ruling that won't
come any earlier than this summer. Appeals could last years. A look
at what those penalities could be and what the tactics of both
sides, the government and Microsoft, are likely to be during this
period. It's predictable that Microsoft will try to put a PR spin
on the event and that'll be included too. (Glass, Cox News

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY JUDITH SHULEVITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Could an Orthodox Jew serve as president of the United States?
The question isn't strictly Talmudic anymore, since the name of an
Orthodox Jew has cropped up on Democratic vice-presidential
candidate short-lists.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman -- who is clearly a long shot -- is a
Democrat from Connecticut whose presumed appeal for Al Gore lies in
his right-of-center politics, his religious commitment (which makes
him attractive to social conservatives), and his early condemnation
of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky (which would help
Gore distance himself from the president's perceived moral
turpitude).
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman is also what Jews call ``Shomer Shabbas'' -- he
observes the rules that say what a Jew can and can't do between
sunset Friday night and sunset Saturday night. Among the many
things he can't do: drive or be driven, turn lights on or off, talk
on the telephone, operate anything powered by electricity, or
write.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Weekly Standard, Lieberman's embrace of these
religious restrictions would probably disqualify him from the
vice-presidency. At the very least, writes reporter Matthew Rees,
they ``would provoke questions about his ability to govern in the
event he became president.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there are questions, there must be answers. We called a
rabbi, professors of Talmud at two leading Jewish universities, and
Lieberman himself to find out what those questions and answers
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start at the beginning. Why are so many things forbidden
on the Jewish Sabbath? The Sabbath is much more important in
Judaism than is generally understood. You'd think the Sabbath would
be a routine event, coming as it does every seventh day, but the
Jews consider the Sabbath to be more sacred than any holiday except
Yom Kippur, the annual Day of Atonement.
</P>
<P>
   Also, contrary to popular belief, the Sabbath isn't entirely a
day of rest. All productivity must cease and all worldly pursuits
must be set aside, but less for one's personal restoration than for
the active contemplation of the wonders of God's creation -- the
chief wonders being, in Judaism, the family, the community, and
Torah, or the Pentateuch and its commentaries.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the Sabbath finds Jews in the proper frame of
mind, they are enjoined from doing or handling anything that might
distract them from the higher purpose of honoring God and all he
has made.
</P>
<P>
   Given these restrictions, how has Lieberman been able to
function as a senator? In his 11 years in the U.S. Senate,
Lieberman said, he has always voted when required to do so on
Friday night or Saturday, and has also attended all emergency White
House meetings held on the Sabbath. To do this, he walks to the
Capitol or White House (which is to say, he does not accept a ride,
which would be forbidden). Luckily for him, senators vote by voice,
not by pushing a button (so that he doesn't have to operate
machinery).
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many technical rules he obeys, he would appear to
be violating the spirit of the Sabbath, according to which one must
refrain from work. How does he get away with it? There are two
answers to this:
</P>
<P>
   -- In Judaism, as opposed to, say, Catholicism, there is no
clear authority or doctrine. Jews are left to draw their own
conclusions based on their readings of Jewish law, with help from
their local rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   -- In consultation with his rabbis, Lieberman has concluded that
while it would be counter to the spirit of the Sabbath to engage in
what he calls ``politics'' -- i.e., photo ops or any other kind of
campaigning -- it is in keeping with the Sabbath to fulfill what he
calls his ``governmental or public responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He explains: ``You come to a point where you have to decide
whether your rigid observance of the ritual puts you in a position
of failing to uphold an ethical value that is also central to your
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he isn't observing the Sabbath as strictly as he could
be, should Lieberman still be considered an Orthodox Jew? According
to two professors of Talmud at Yeshiva University, an Orthodox
college, Lieberman's choice to perform his duties as a government
official on the Sabbath when he's required to do so can be
reconciled with the strictest construction of Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman is granted an exemption from the Sabbath's enforced
idleness on the basis of two concepts: pikuach nefesh, roughly
translated from Hebrew as ``regard for human life,'' and tzorchei
tzibbur, or ``the needs of the community.'' Under pikuach nefesh, a
Jew may profane the Sabbath if human life is at stake, as it may
sometimes be in Senate legislation. Tzorchei tzibbur says that Jews
are allowed to make decisions that affect the entire community on
the Sabbath -- they just can't make ones that affect them or their
family alone.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Lieberman allows himself to do, these rabbis say, is
covered by one of those two concepts. (It should be noted that
pikuach nefesh has traditionally been understood as pertaining only
to Jewish life, but rabbinical rulings in the second half of this
century have extended it to non-Jews, mainly on the grounds that to
save only the lives of Jews under pikuach nefesh would get the
goyim so upset that Jewish lives would be put at risk.)
</P>
<P>
   So, is there anything he couldn't do as vice-president, or as a
vice-presidential candidate? Asked about his vice-presidential
prospects, Lieberman was careful to issue ``the standard
disqualification, which is sincerely expressed,'' that he didn't
expect to be named vice-president, nor was he seeking the position.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, he wanted to clear up any misunderstanding
about what a religiously observant person could or could not do in
an executive office. Lieberman says that, as a hypothetical
vice-president, he would balance his duties with the demands of the
Sabbath much as he has balanced them as senator: ``I feel I've
reached a conclusion on these questions that I'm comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not campaign or perform any other strictly political
duties. He would, however, vote in the Senate if he was needed to
break a tie and he would meet with world leaders or members of the
Cabinet -- ``I'd try to schedule them some other time, but if
something needed to be done, I'd do it.'' What if he had to travel
to meet them? ``I'd try to avoid it, but if I had to ride, I'd
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the case of an emergency? Lieberman refused to speculate
about anything as dire as a president's incapacitation: ``I'm so
far down the chain of hypotheticals, I'm going to let you draw your
own conclusion.'' But presumably he would be allowed to do just
about anything he had to under the rule of pikuach nefesh --
including being sworn in as president should anything happen to the
president, and pushing the button to launch a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   What if something came up on the Sabbath which wasn't a
life-or-death emergency, but which he really ought to take care of
-- then and there? Yeshiva professor of Talmud J. David Bleich says
Lieberman would be allowed to delegate just about any urgent but
non-life-saving task to a non-Jew, as long as it was also on behalf
of non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   A Jew is forbidden to ask a non-Jew to do something for him on
the Sabbath that he wouldn't do for himself (in other words, a Jew
is not allowed to have a Shabbas goy, even though many do) but ``to
personally give directions to non-Jews for the benefit of non-Jews
is permissible,'' says Bleich. This rule would cover anything that
could be construed as for the good of American citizens, since the
majority of them are not Jewish.

</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ A ledeall: Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson is expected to issue his ruling in the Microsoft
antitrust case at 5 p.m. EDT. As his findings of fact in November
largely agreed with the governments' case against Microsoft, the
judge's conclusions of law are almost certain to find that the
company violated federal antitrust laws. It is uncertain, however,
how sweeping his ruling will be. The judge will then consider
remedies, which could range from forcing Microsoft to change
certain business practices to a breakup of the company. Shares of
Microsoft fall nearly 14 percent in early trading. By Joel
Brinkley.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Pistone, FBI mob infiltrator known to his underworld
colleagues as Joe Falcone, is on the phone. Let's listen in.
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: Mags, you know I can't come home tonight.
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE (his long-suffering wife): But honey, you haven't been
home since the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: I know. But I got a thing.
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE: What thing?
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: I can't tell you. It's a thing!
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE: But the girls miss you.
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: Are you saying I'm a bad father?
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE: Well ....
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: Hold on. I got another call. (Pause.) Hello?
</P>
<P>
   SONNY NAPOLI (Joe's mob boss): Joe, it's Sonny. Pick me up
tomorrow, 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: Sure. What's up?
</P>
<P>
   SONNY: I got a thing.
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: OK. (Pause.) Honey, you still there?
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE: Who was that?
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: Nobody.
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE: Do I know this nobody?
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: It was nobody! Now, where were we?
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE: You asked me if you were a bad father?
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: And?
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE (sobbing): Well, for someone who works for the feds and
is gone for weeks at a time and had to move us to the suburbs and
make us change our names and put the kids in new schools, and who
comes home occasionally with a black eye and cuts on his face, I
guess you're not so bad.
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: That's better.
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE: When will we get to see you?
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: Soon. At that thing.
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE: What thing?
</P>
<P>
   PISTONE/FALCONE: Gotta go.
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE: But ...
</P>
<P>
   The preceding isn't from an actual script of the new series,
``Falcone,'' just a fair summation of where it's going. And maybe
it's no coincidence that ``Falcone'' rhymes with phone. It is the
prop of choice in this stylish mob drama that CBS wants us to watch
nearly every night for the next week, miniseries style. Problem is,
some performances in ``Falcone'' seem to have been phoned in. Some
of the writing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the guy who inspired the film ``Donnie Brasco,''
``Falcone'' takes viewers inside the New York Mafia with undercover
agent Joe Pistone. Jason Gedrick plays Pistone/Falcone with little
emotion, apparently because FBI agents aren't supposed to show all
their cards. The guy he has endeared himself to in the mob, Sonny
Napoli, is played with little emotion by Titus Welliver, because
mobsters don't like to show their cards, either. Even Joe's wife,
Maggie (Amy Carlson), tries to keep her cards to herself in this
back-and-forth gin game. Unfortunately, when she does give in to
her pent-up emotions, well, it's as unsatisfying as a low-fat
cannolli.
</P>
<P>
   After two episodes appear back to back Tuesday, the remaining
seven installments in the series' first order will run tomorrow
through April 12, skipping only Sunday night. It's an unusual
tactic, especially for a dramatic series, but not a bad idea. CBS
sent six episodes to TV critics and, while ``Falcone'' has
limitations, including stomach-turning violence and pervasive
woodenness, it tends to grow on a person, kind of like nostril
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Falcone. One-hour drama series about an FBI agent who
infiltrates a mob operation. Starring Jason Gedrick, Titus
Welliver, Robert John Burke, Amy Carlson, Sonny Marinelli and Lillo
Brancato Jr. Two-hour series premiere Tuesday night on CBS;
one-hour episodes continue through April 12, except Sunday. m.
Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

<P>
   Frances Gray Patton, a writer whose short stories appeared in
The New Yorker through four decades and whose works included the
popular 1954 novel ``Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' died Tuesday at
Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. She was 94 and lived
in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Patton's finely crafted stories offered glimpses into Durham
society in the mid-20th century, a world she knew well as a Duke
faculty wife. Her first published work, ``A Piece of Bread,'' the
story of a Southern girl's encounter with a prison chain gang, won
a Kenyon Review prize and was included among the 1945 ``O. Henry
Memorial Award Prize Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, The New Yorker began publishing Patton's stories, 30
in the next 10 years. Others appeared in magazines like Colliers,
Harper's, The Saturday Review of Literature and McCall's. Her first
book, ``The Finer Things of Life'' (1951), a collection culled
mostly from works that appeared in The New Yorker, earned praise
from critics.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Patton's first novel, ``Good Morning, Miss
Dove,'' was published. Developed from her story ``The Terrible Miss
Dove,'' first published in Ladies' Home Journal, the work
chronicles the life of a strict but beloved geography teacher in a
small American town whose sudden illness shocks the community.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The New York Times, Charles Poore described the work
as ``ruthlessly sentimental'' and ``a cheerful mixture of `Goodbye
Chips' and `Mary Poppins,' with touches of the rigorous way to
salvation from `Life With Father.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The novel was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and the movie
rights were sold to 20th Century Fox, which turned the story into a
popular film starring Jennifer Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Patton published ``A Piece of Luck,'' a second
collection of stories, set mostly in suburbia, that explored the
private worlds of children and women. A third collection, ``28
Stories,'' was published in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Frances MacRae Gray was born in Raleigh, N.C., where her father
was editor of The Raleigh Times. Her mother had been the first
woman to enroll at the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Patton became a writer by way of the theater. After high school,
she attended Trinity College, now Duke University, before enrolling
at the University of North Carolina, where she held a fellowship as
a playwright and was active in the Carolina Playmakers. Over the
years, she taught creative writing at both universities.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a son, Robert, of San Francisco; two
daughters, Mary Bogdonoff of Manhattan and Susannah Patton of
Bethesda, Md.; nine grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.

<P>
   Bruce Paltrow refused to submit to the cancer that burrowed
rapidly into his throat, penetrated lymph nodes and snaked around
his carotid artery.
</P>
<P>
   The film and television producer and his family plunged into the
mysterious world of cancer treatments with a literal lust for life.
They studied all the options and asked their physicians lots of
questions. Paltrow chose aggressive surgery, doubled the standard
radiation treatment and sought alternative therapies from
acupuncture to vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   The assault drove the throat cancer into remission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a fistfight,'' said Paltrow, father of Academy
Award-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow. ``You have to go forward,
attack it _ do everything you can to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy won't work for everyone. But the attitude will.
</P>
<P>
   Paltrow is part of a growing trend of assertive medical
consumers. Dr. David Feinberg, a psychiatrist at the University of
California, Los Angeles, predicts that within two years a wave of
assertive, informed patients will transform the medical profession,
bring foreign terms such as customer service and satisfaction into
the medical vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg, co-author of ``Don't Let Your HMO Kill You''
(Routledge; $14.95), is one of the leaders of this charge. His book
is one of several appearing on bookstore shelves that advises
patients how to manage their managed-care plan.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are already responding to the trend. UCLA's new $600
million medical center will feature warm, sunlit corridors, tasty
food and in-room family areas instead of cold, uncomfortable
waiting rooms. The hospital design is a nod to a future when
patients will have a choice on where to spend their health-care
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   HBO addresses this patient call to arms with a 2 1/2-hour
television documentary, ``Cancer: Evolution to Revolution,'' that
shows cancer patients how to take an active, aggressive role in the
treatment of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are expecting more from their doctors,'' said Joseph
Lovett, the veteran television health journalist who produced and
directed the HBO special. ``This show is not about miracle cures.
It's about knowing how to get involved, finding the latest
treatments as they develop and having as many options as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is also fueling change. Medical Web sites _
government, non-profit and commercial _ make it easy for patients
to get enough information to pose intelligent questions. Doctors no
longer control all the knowledge. In fact, there is so much
information out there, most physicians can't keep up with it all.
</P>
<P>
   This health-care revolution has been a long time coming. The old
fee-for- services system sent health-care costs skyrocketing. HMOs
stepped into the picture in the early 1990s, promising _ and
failing _ to control costs. Feinberg said patients were left out of
the loop because insurers and doctors were accountable only to
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Patients didn't fit into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average patient asks four questions in a 10-minute
visit,'' Feinberg said. ``The typical physician interrupts within
19 seconds. There's not a lot of communication going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinberg said that companies such as Xerox that give employees a
medical allowance and let them shop for their own health plan, are
on the forefront of a new wave of medical care. Things tend to
improve when the person providing the service is directly
accountable to the customer, not to a disinterested third party
(like an employer).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Clarke, a University of Southern California physician
and co-author of ``Surviving Modern Medicine'' (Rutgers University
Press; $18), said a patient needs information and a psychological
edge to gain control of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an economic viewpoint, the supply side can treat
customers indifferently and get away with it,'' Clarke said. ``The
antidote to that is to be proactive. They don't need to be
adversarial or confrontational, but they do need to be active on
their behalf.''

   Here are a few jumping-off points in the growing sea of medical
information:
</P>
<P>
   Books: ``Don't Let Your HMO Kill You'' (Routledge; $14.95); and
``Surviving Modern Medicine'' (Rutgers University Press; $18) are
two titles in a growing cadre of books that spell out ways to take
charge of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Television: HBO is taking the unusual step of making its signal
available for free as it rebroadcasts ``Cancer: Evolution to
Revolution'' at 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, 10 a.m. Thursday, 8 a.m. April
11, and 2:30 p.m. April 17. The network is also offering the tape
free of charge to cancer organizations. PBS' ``Frontline'' tackles
the managed-care issue at 10 p.m. Tuesday with ``Dr. Solomon's
Dilemma,'' a detailed look at how physicians are battling HMO for
control of patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Internet: Most illnesses are featured on individual Web sites or
have advocacy groups that are easily found via Internet search
engines. General information is available at Web sites such as
www.peoplesmed.org, a nonprofit medical consumer advocacy group.
For the next six months, HBO is offering extensive cancer contact
information at www.hbo.com. PBS goes into more depth on the
HMO-doctor struggle at www.pbs.org/frontline. &QL;

U.S. CRITICIZES ISRAEL'S SALE OF MILITARY RADAR SYSTEMS TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With Prime Minister Ehud Barak standing by his side,
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen on Monday strongly criticized
Israel's decision to supply advanced airborne radar systems to
China.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government considers it ``counter-productive'' to
provide China with AWACS-type surveillance aircraft, Cohen said at
a news conference Monday morning after meeting with Barak, who
declined to halt the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Aircraft Industries, a state-owned defense contractor,
has already equipped one Chinese-owned Ilyushin cargo plane with
early-warning radar systems for a reported $230 million. It is
expected to present the aircraft for delivery to China's president,
Jiang Zemin, during his visit here later this week. Israel has
offered China systems for three more such planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have indicated before that the United States does not
support the sale of this type of technology to China because of the
potential of changing the strategic balance in that region, with
the tensions running as high as they are between China and
Taiwan,'' Cohen said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak responded that Israel would ``take into account'' U.S.
concerns. But he indicated that Israel expects to proceed with the
promised sale of at least the first radar-equipped aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are aware of the sensitivity in the United States with
regard to China,'' he said. Then he quickly added, ``We are, of
course, aware of our commitments in the contracts that we signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's arrival here Thursday will be the first official visit
to Israel by a Chinese leader, making this a singularly awkward
week to renege on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. congressional leaders have warned Israel that
proceeding with the sales could jeopardize support for the $17
billion military aid package Israel is seeking in connection with
an eventual peace treaty with Syria. Among the items Israel is
requesting are U.S. Boeing AWACS, considered far more sophisticated
than the Israeli version.
</P>
<P>
   According to Israeli military officials, Israel notified the
United States four years ago of its intent to offer airborne radar
surveillance systems to China. Pentagon officials reviewing the
proposed contract determined then that Israel would not be
providing China with proprietary U.S. military technology, the
Israelis said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. objections to the sale now are based not on narrow
interpretations of technology transfer agreements but on the
broader principle that Israel as a U.S. ally should defer to U.S.
strategic judgments in regions beyond the Middle East _ especially
in areas where the United States has bases and warships. The United
States has not supplied arms to China since 1992.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cohen voiced concerns against the sale privately before but had
never spoken out publicly here.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Barak said, ``We are aware of the need to be in close
coordination and contact with the United States on every issue that
might pose a risk to American interests.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Barak has also placed great emphasis on the self-sufficiency
of Israel's military industry, which Pentagon officials readily
acknowledge can survive only through an aggressive sales program.
Israel Aircraft Industries is the country's largest export earner,
selling weapons systems and refurbished fighter jets to dozens of
countries, as well as civilian commuter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and his predecessors have also put great stock in a
strengthened relationship with China, seen as both a critical
market for Israel and a bulwark against diplomatic isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Israel did not establish full diplomatic relations with
China until 1997, it has provided arms to Beijing since the 1980s.
Israel aided the ongoing development of China's F-10 fighter jet,
which is expected to carry a version of Israel's Pitun missile. But
the potentially billion-dollar order for four AWACS-type planes
would, if realized, be its largest sale to China yet.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials also consider the project important. Li Peng,
the chairman of China's National People's Congress, and Che Ho
Tien, China's defense minister, have personally inspected the
converted Ilyushin surveillance planes on visits to Israel in the
past six months.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, April 4:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ROBOT-SURGERY (Undated) _ A robot with three tiny metal
arms, operated by a surgeon at a computer console, now is
performing operations on patients, invading the body through
pencil-sized holes. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is
the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession
since it began nearly 40 years ago. Eventually, surgeons believe,
most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are inserted
through pencil-sized holes punched in the patient's chest. By Gina
Kolata. (1970 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PHYSICS-STRINGS (Undated) _ In the last few months, new
ideas emerging from theoretical workshops offer some hope of
connecting the airy speculations of superstring theory to reality.
Physicists are proposing a revised view in which at least one of
the six extra dimensions expounded in the theory is vastly larger,
large enough perhaps to be indirectly probed with existing
accelerators. Some experts say it is conceivable that experimenters
have already found subtle hints of other dimensions. They've just
had no way of appreciating what they were seeing. By George
Johnson. (2050 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT3.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MUSSELS-HUDSON (Undated) _ The zebra mussel has transformed
the chemistry of the freshwater portion of the Hudson. The mussels
consume microscopic plants, called phytoplankton, that are the
basis of the aquatic food chain. One result has been that numbers
of tiny aquatic animals that feed on the phytoplankton were cut
about in half, sharply reducing food for bigger creatures. Now
experts have discovered that mussels suck up so much oxygen from
the water that in summer that much of the ecosystem is approaching
a danger point at which other aquatic creatures begin to flee or
die, a new study reports. By William K. Stevens. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOGS-EVOLVE (Undated) _ After splitting genetically from
wolves around 135,000 years ago, dogs have followed humans through
every step in their cultural and social development, from hunting
and gathering to agricultural societies, from the farm to the city
and suburb. The dog has helped domesticate sheep and cattle, served
selflessly as a guard, beast of burden, guide, and erstwhile
companion capable of easing the pain of loneliness. So closely
entwined are their lives that a number of evolutionary biologists
argue that dogs and humans have co-evolved. By Mark Derr. (1450
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT1.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLATOW-NPR (Undated) _ A conversation with Ira Flatow, one
of the most influential communicators of science. He is the host of
National Public Radio talkfest, ``Science Friday,'' a weekly
dialogue with scientists and members of Flatow's audience of two
and a half million listeners who phone in their questions, ideas
and opinions. By Claudia Dreifus. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT5.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SEA-FLOOR-MAP (Undated) _ Oceans are hardly perfectly level
from one place to another. The height of an undisturbed sea's
surface can differ from a few inches to several feet from place to
place depending upon what lies far beneath the water. Scientists
have learned to exploit this from above to map mountains, valleys,
trenches and other features on the ocean floor that have gone
virtually unvisited by humans and their devices. This information,
coupled with data from submarine exploration, sonar scans and
instruments lowered to the depths, has now produced the most
comprehensive, detailed maps of sea-floor topography released to
the public. By Warren E. Leary. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on
principles of color found in male Indonesian butterfly and released
California condors. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BIOPSY-ACCURACY (Undated) _ Biopsies are sometimes wrong,
and second opinions are often proper when cancer is diagnosed. And
determining if cancer is present in sample of tissue the size of a
pinhead is not always clear cut. The experience and specialty of
the pathologist is often crucial an accurate finding. By Laurie
Tarkan. (1475 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT6.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOCTORS-CONSULT (Undated) _ Despite doctors' best
intentions, a chill wind still can blow through the exam room when
patients say they want second opionions. But often, without
patients' knowledge, doctors are already consulting colleagues
about treatment options and treatment plans. And when doctors are
perplexed, they often directly refer the patients to specialists.
By Abigail Zuger, M.D. (1100 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PROPHYLACTIC-MASTECTOMY (Undated) _ A desperate measure for
reducing the risk of breast cancer, removing both breasts while
they are still healthy, has been proved effective even for women
who carry genetic defects that put them at the very highest level
of risk for the disease. By Denise Grady. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: New warnings are
issued on the dangers of piercings, including spurring allergies,
causing infections, leaving unsightly scars and causing injuries.
And, some teenagers, live to regret their excesses. By Jane E.
Brody. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT2.
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Boys who are shorter are more likely to be held back in
school, a study from Australia suggests. (150 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Half of the surgical patients surveyed in a University of
Colorado study used herbal or alternative medicines or vitamins in
the days before their operation, although many of these substances
can interfere with anesthetics, prolong bleeding or affect blood
pressure. (250 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Thinking while driving can be dangerous, but mental tasks that
involve spatial calculations seem to distract drivers more than
verbal problems, a new study from Spain concludes. (300 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Massage may make tired athletes feel better, but doesn't
appear to help muscles recover from exertion any faster, a study
published last week in the British Journal of Sports Medicine
concludes. (180 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT4.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study has found that one important class of high blood
pressure medications, thiazide diuretics, does not increase the
risk of diabetes, as had previously been suspected. In fact,
patients taking drugs in the class developed fewer cases of
diabetes than people not taking the drugs. One other kind of
hypertension medications, beta blockers, was found to increase
diabetes risk by 28 percent. But authors say it doesn't mean people
should give up their beta blockers. (225 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Why does
drinking alcohol give the illusion of warmth without keeping you
warm in cold weather? By C. Claiborne Ray. (280 words)

 &HT;    Project aims to track slaves' past in Texas
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Driving to work in 1998, Eric Walther turned on
Allen Parkway in Houston and collided head-on with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Construction workers at the Allen Parkway Village, a public
housing complex Walther passed every day, uncovered a cemetery
where former slaves were buried. For Walther, an associate
professor of history at the University of Houston, the find was
poignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking there are hardly any physical remains of
slavery in Texas,'' he said. ``We find something and build right
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walther's desire to put a face on those who were denied their
humanity has blossomed into a project some consider impossible. He
wants to document every black slave who ever lived in Texas _ a
population he estimates at 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most people laugh initially when they hear of the scope of
Walther's ambition. He admits the task won't be easy. Most slaves
were given only first names. Their births and deaths were not
recorded. Slaves could not legally marry, so marriage records don't
exist. The records that do exist are spotty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck to the gentleman,'' said David A. Williams,
executive director of the Texas African American Heritage
Organization based at Huston-Tillotson College. ``That's a terrible
load to undertake as a researcher. I wouldn't touch it with a
10-foot pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Walther, whose students are working with him on the project, has
heard it all before. To his surprise, many more records exist than
he ever imagined. Slaves and former slaves are listed in census
documents, tax records and, after the Civil War, voter registration
records, among other public documents. Newspapers published ads
seeking runaway slaves.
</P>
<P>
   One of Walther's students, Clayton Lust, compiled more than 300
descriptions of slaves, using the manifests from slave ships on
microfilm at the genealogy library in Houston. The manifests list
the slave's first name, age, height, scars and coloring _ from
black to copper. Some had scars on their cheeks; one was missing a
finger, signs of how slaves were treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really personalizes the whole thing,'' Lust said. ``There
was one slave named Amanda. Amanda is my sister's name. You can see
relatives' names all over, and when you see them in this sort of
context, you think, 'God, how would I feel?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lust, who grew up in the North and ``never thought of slavery,''
said working on Walther's Texas Slavery Project has ``put the face
on it ... that makes (slavery) a more compelling lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Walther, who is Jewish and a native of Los Angeles, was
fascinated by the Civil War as a child. He is emotional about
slavery partly because of his own family's history. A much older
cousin survived the Holocaust because he was young and able to do
slave labor for the Nazis, said Walther, who is 39.
</P>
<P>
   Slave labor also helped build Texas, he said. Slaves worked on
railroads, made bricks and did construction, in addition to working
in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who came here without any choice and were told what
to do and helped create the modern state of Texas deserve some
credit,'' Walther said.
</P>
<P>
   He also hopes his project will lead some African Americans to
their ancestry. ``That would be the most satisfying thing to me,''
said Walther, who has a Web site dedicated to the research at
http://www.texassla- veryproject.uh.edu. Donaly Brice, a reference
archivist at the state Library and Archives Commission, said he was
not aware of any similar project in Texas. Many people don't know
Texas' slave population was large and grew during the Civil War as
slave owners migrated from states ravaged by fighting, Brice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be impossible to find every slave, but he could
get a large number of them,'' Brice said.
</P>
<P>
   State archivist Chris LaPlante said the agency is prioritizing
research that documents ``the undocumented community,'' primarily
African Americans and Hispanics in Texas. Grants are available to
further such work, LaPlante said.
</P>
<P>
   Walther expects to have several thousand names by early May, but
because the project could take years, he's looking for any help he
can get. He realizes he probably won't get every name, but he
expects to produce a name and, at the very least, a biographical
sentence on 80 percent to 90 percent of the slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been studying history at the college level since
1978,'' Walther said. ``This is breathing new life into me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Swick, another student in Walther's class, said Walther's
passion is obvious and contagious. Swick has been researching the
Houston Telegraph, a 19th century newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found ads where they were selling slaves. I saw ads about
slaves running away and the reward for them,'' Swick said. ``You
see it (slavery) in the movies, but it was right here in Houston.
My family is from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never think of slavery as hitting so close to home,'' he
said. ``This will hopefully bring it home for a few other people,
too.''

   SCI-ROBOT-SURGERY (Undated) _ A robot with three tiny metal
arms, operated by a surgeon at a computer console, now is
performing operations on patients, invading the body through
pencil-sized holes. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is
the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession
since it began nearly 40 years ago. Eventually, surgeons believe,
most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are inserted
through pencil-sized holes punched in the patient's chest. By Gina
Kolata. (1970 words)

<P>
   SCI-PHYSICS-STRINGS (Undated) _ In the last few months, new
ideas emerging from theoretical workshops offer some hope of
connecting the airy speculations of superstring theory to reality.
Physicists are proposing a revised view in which at least one of
the six extra dimensions expounded in the theory is vastly larger,
large enough perhaps to be indirectly probed with existing
accelerators. Some experts say it is conceivable that experimenters
have already found subtle hints of other dimensions. They've just
had no way of appreciating what they were seeing. By George
Johnson. (2050 words)

   SCI-MUSSELS-HUDSON (Undated) _ The zebra mussel has transformed
the chemistry of the freshwater portion of the Hudson. The mussels
consume microscopic plants, called phytoplankton, that are the
basis of the aquatic food chain. One result has been that numbers
of tiny aquatic animals that feed on the phytoplankton were cut
about in half, sharply reducing food for bigger creatures. Now
experts have discovered that mussels suck up so much oxygen from
the water that in summer that much of the ecosystem is approaching
a danger point at which other aquatic creatures begin to flee or
die, a new study reports. By William K. Stevens. (1250 words)

<P>
   SCI-DOGS-EVOLVE (Undated) _ After splitting genetically from
wolves around 135,000 years ago, dogs have followed humans through
every step in their cultural and social development, from hunting
and gathering to agricultural societies, from the farm to the city
and suburb. The dog has helped domesticate sheep and cattle, served
selflessly as a guard, beast of burden, guide, and erstwhile
companion capable of easing the pain of loneliness. So closely
entwined are their lives that a number of evolutionary biologists
argue that dogs and humans have co-evolved. By Mark Derr. (1450

   SCI-SEA-FLOOR-MAP (Undated) _ Oceans are hardly perfectly level
from one place to another. The height of an undisturbed sea's
surface can differ from a few inches to several feet from place to
place depending upon what lies far beneath the water. Scientists
have learned to exploit this from above to map mountains, valleys,
trenches and other features on the ocean floor that have gone
virtually unvisited by humans and their devices. This information,
coupled with data from submarine exploration, sonar scans and
instruments lowered to the depths, has now produced the most

perplexed, they often directly refer the patients to specialists.

risk of diabetes, as had previously been suspected. In fact,
patients taking drugs in the class developed fewer cases of

U.S. RECEIVES VISA APPLICATIONS FROM ELIAN'S FATHER AND 27 OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal officials and lawyers representing the Miami relatives
of Elian Gonzalez resumed negotiations over his future Monday,
while State Department officials received visa applications from
the boy's father and 27 other Cubans who are prepared to fly to the
United States to reclaim him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Justice Department and Immigration and
Naturalization Service met with family members Monday morning to
ask them to commit in writing to handing over the 6-year-old boy to
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, or to the U.S. government if
their legal action fails.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle and caretaker, is
appealing in a federal court in Atlanta to compel the INS to grant
Elian an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   If Lazaro Gonzalez does not sign an agreement, the INS said it
might revoke Elian's temporary residency status by 9 a.m. Tuesday.
The agency pushed that deadline back twice already during talks
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and President Clinton have said they
want the boy to be reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his mother were fleeing Cuba in November when the
Florida-bound refugee boat carrying them capsized. Fishermen
discovered Elian floating in an inner tube, but his mother and 10
others drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, lawyers for the boy's Miami relatives said
that even if his father came to Miami to retrieve Elian, they would
not let him take custody because of potential ``psychological
harm'' to the boy. But Monday morning, the family appeared willing
to negotiate on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``They are welcoming him today to come and sit down as a
family,'' Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, said on
NBC's ``Today Show'' Monday morning. ``Get the press, get the
lawyers out of the way and talk about this as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, the U.S. Interests Section in Havana received
passports and visa applications from Juan Miguel Gonzalez and the
27 other people who would accompany him to this country. President
Fidel Castro said on Sunday night that he would allow the father to
come alone to this country if he could bring Elian back to Cuba
immediately, or he would allow the father to come with an entourage
if they have to wait through the court appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The entourage includes Elian's teachers, classmates and
relatives, as well as a high-ranking government official,
psychiatrists and other medical personnel. A State Department
spokesman said that visa requests for Elian's immediate family
would be expedited, while the others would be reviewed through the
lens of ``national interests.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We do expect to be making decisions on these visa applications
fairly quickly,'' James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman,
said Monday. ``It has been our policy for many, many days now that
we have indicated that we will stand ready to expedite the
processing of visa applications for the immediate family of Elian
Gonzalez.''

<P>
   It takes a piggish amount of arrogance to attempt to limit the
free speech rights of the people. But most of Congress is up to it
_ as well as many state legislators, mayors and governors.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, the U.S. Senate was only four votes shy of passing
a flag desecration amendment that would have limited the First
Amendment protections of the Bill of Rights. The U.S. House had
already passed the amendment last June with 15 more votes than
necessary to achieve the required two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   Flag desecration or flag burning in a political context is both
an act of dissent and a statement. Clearly, though many who object
to flag burning deny it, the act speaks volumes. It is one way that
those who protest U.S. foreign policy or U.S. acts of war can
startle the media into paying attention to their cause or dissent,
and thereby get their message to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 20th century, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized
that some actions are also speech or even predominantly speech.
Symbolic speech the court calls them. Protest marches are speech;
picket lines are a form of speech; raising a red flag is a form of
speech; wearing black arm bands to protest the Vietnam War was
speech; waving an American flag when our soldiers return home and
march down New York City's Fifth Avenue is speech; and so, in
contrast, is burning the flag a form of speech.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment protects the right of a speaker to support a
war in which this nation is engaged. It also protects the right of
a speaker to criticize that same war. If waving a flag in support
of a war is protected speech, then burning it to show one's
disagreement with the war must also be protected speech. That's the
essence of the First Amendment and the meaning of the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The 63 members of the Senate and the 305 members of the House
who would hog our right of speech and dissent seem to have an
extremely myopic vision of our right to freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   Their vision certainly doesn't take into account the
constitutional history of the First Amendment and the U.S.
Constitution. Nor does this myopia take into account the founding
fathers' grand experiment _ a people given the power to govern
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution makes an absolute
statement about free speech _ not unlike the founders' clear
meaning of the First Amendment: ``The Senators and Representatives
... for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be
questioned in any other place.'' That means no matter what a
senator or representative says about any citizen of the United
States or anyone else, or about any government action, they cannot
be brought into a court of law. They cannot be sued for slander or
arrested for sedition if what they say is spoken on the floor of
the House or Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Had the flag amendment passed and been ratified by two-thirds of
the states, any senator could still burn a flag on the Senate floor
and not be taken to jail for this symbolic speech.
</P>
<P>
   The overarching concept of self-governance means that the people
must have all the rights of debate and speech that their elected
representatives have under the Constitution. That's why the First
Amendment reads, in part: ``Congress shall make no law ...
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-governance is precisely the reason that political speech
enjoys the greatest protection under the Constitution. And flag
burning as dissenting political speech must continue to be
protected.
</P>
<P>
   By what foggy notion of liberty and democracy can our elected
officials seek to take away a portion of that right and yet retain
it for themselves?
</P>
<P>
   A number of state legislatures have been attempting to restrict
the Internet to only that material which is deemed appropriate for
children to view or read. Anything considered ``inappropriate'' or
``harmful'' to children would be banned from the World Wide Web.
Fortunately, all these Internet laws have been struck down as an
unconstitutional infringements on freedom of speech and freedom of
the press.
</P>
<P>
   These elected officials may be too near-sighted to see that the
Internet is the most democratic form of mass communication ever
invented. Or, they may be afraid of its inherent power.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with access to the Internet can be a publisher and have
thousands of readers. Being an Internet publisher doesn't require
wealth, only knowledge and the ability to communicate. As such,
this new form of communication _ the people's mass communication
system _ jeopardizes the elitist power structure. And that is the
real reason politicians want to control it and limit what can be
communicated through this medium.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has finally realized that
his attacks on the Brooklyn Museum of Art for showing a
controversial British art exhibit were bound to fail. Last week,
his administration settled out of court with the museum and
reinstated city funding to the institution.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's numerous attacks on freedom of speech have shown he
is deficient in his understanding of the First Amendment and the
protections it provides to speech, art, music and books.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent opinion, Judge Guido Calabresi of the Second U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, a former Yale School dean, criticized the
number of First Amendment lawsuits filed against Giuliani's
administration. He wrote, ``We would be ostriches if we failed to
take judicial notice of the heavy stream of First Amendment
litigation generation by New York City in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is another elected official who acts as if the people
should have a much narrower and more limited right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican Party's choice for presidential candidate,
George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, has an abysmal First
Amendment record in his state. He has had protesters arrested for
peacefully demonstrating against his administration's policies and
proposed legislation at the state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The public sidewalk outside the governor's mansion has a long
tradition of being a forum for rallies, demonstrations, and even
press conferences. Not any more. Bush doesn't like criticism.
Therefore, the citizens of Texas are not allowed to express or hear
other points of view concerning state public policies in front of
the mansion where many of those policies originate.
</P>
<P>
   It takes unmitigated gall for an elected official to think he or
she has the right to take away or restrict the rights of the
people, rights essential for self-governing _ the right to discuss
and debate public policy, the right to dissent, the right of free
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, arrogance instead of respect for the people's
rights seems to have become the new currency in American politics.

&HT;     DIVERS TO EXPLORE THE `TITANIC' OF LAKE TAHOE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAUSALITO, Calif. _ The next time your yacht sinks, call Mitch
Marken.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm good at is finding things,'' said the veteran
undersea explorer as he relaxed in the living room of his Sausalito
home. Behind him was a huge vintage photograph of the SS Tahoe, a
169-foot steamer long gone, but hardly forgotten, from the surface
of its namesake lake.
</P>
<P>
   Marken, 39, put up the picture years before he was recruited to
locate the SS Tahoe's resting place 400 feet beneath the waves.
Thanks to Marken's spot-on reckoning, 10 divers will be able to
make a death-defying visit to the ship's well-preserved carcass
come August.
</P>
<P>
   An icon of bygone times at the lake shared by Nevada and
California, the SS Tahoe was scuttled off Glenbrook Cove in 1940.
From 1896 to 1936, the queen of the lake had carried up to 200
passengers, as well as heavy cargo, from town to town around
Tahoe's 70-mile shoreline. Eventually, the construction of roads
around the lake and the loss of a lucrative mail contract made its
operation uneconomical.
</P>
<P>
   Even then the elegant craft _ appointed in bronze, brass,
marble, teak and leather _ had come to symbolize a vanishing way of
life in the High Sierra. Tahoe shore dwellers ``swore that her
sinking had been a sacrilege,'' according to lake historian Edward
B. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Six decades later, the legend lives on. People who never saw the
SS Tahoe _ that's pretty much everybody _ madly miss her. Photos of
the classic craft decorate businesses and residences around the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Tahoe's Titanic,'' said Marken, an underwater
archaeologist who has dived to the fabled treasure ship Atocha and
written a book on Spanish shipwreck pottery. ``It's from the same
period. Even the lifeboats are very similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Titanic, the Tahoe has been the subject of intermittent
searches over the years. A National Geographic crew, directed by
Marken, managed to capture filmed images of the sunken ship in
1993. Others have tried to ``salvage'' the boat by chomping into it
with grappling hooks, causing some damage.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Marken brought the recently formed New Millennium Dive
Expeditions team back to the spot where the SS Tahoe rests. The
team, led by Martin McClellan of Reno, Nev., sent a remote
underwater vehicle down to the Tahoe on a reconnaissance mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Mitch's help, we would have been a hair to the south
and we might not have been able to find the wreck all day,''
McClellan said. He said data gained from the ROV would be essential
when he and his team made their daring dive to the SS Tahoe _ the
deepest dive ever undertaken at such a high elevation.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said the divers would be able to spend only about 10
minutes each at the wreck site. What will they do there?
</P>
<P>
   ``Various things,'' he said. ``Our task on the first dive is to
dedicate a brass plaque to the D.L. Bliss family (former SS Tahoe
owners). We'll hang it on the bow, or maybe just set it there. It
will have an engraving of all the names of the dive staff.''
</P>
<P>
   On subsequent dives, McClellan said, the team will conduct
archaeological research, testing hull integrity and mapping
adjacent debris.
</P>
<P>
   Some debris on the deck, including fishing lines and grappling
hooks broken loose in unauthorized attempts to snag part of the
boat. might be removed if Marken approves. ``I want to work this
out with Mitch,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   Marken's authority stems from his status as Nevada's official
underwater archaeologist, which seems, at first blush, like being
official avalanche geologist for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I created that post with the belief that I wouldn't be
spending too much time on it, and you know what? I was right,''
Marken said with a chuckle. He said his work for the Silver State's
archaeology division had consisted mostly of consulting on projects
like the salvage of sunken airplanes in Lake Mead.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the submerged Bronze Age house in a loch
in the Scottish Highlands where Marken made one of his first
research dives while studying for his doctorate in maritime
archaeology at the University of Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Marken, a San Francisco native, has since searched for Spanish
galleons off the coasts of the Dominican Republic and Bermuda,
underwater artifacts in the Gulf of Thailand and a sunken Mayan
temple 40 feet beneath the surface of Lake Peten in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Marken teaches an underwater archaeology class in the University
of San Francisco's continuing education program.
</P>
<P>
   The most celebrated ship that Marken has visited is the Atocha,
a treasure galleon off the Florida coast. Marken provided
archaeological guidance for the salvage operator, Mel Fisher. He
did not pick up any treasure for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an acquirer of gold and silver coins,'' he said. ``But
I'm friends with the treasure-diving community. I walk the line.''

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The picture of the SS Tahoe on Marken's wall came from his
father, who once lived at the lake. He's involved in the current
project because the SS Tahoe, like any vehicle abandoned for 50
years on Nevada state land, is considered state property.
</P>
<P>
   When Marken led McClellan's team to seek the SS Tahoe last
month, ``it was right where I thought it was,'' Marken said.
``She's looking just like she did in '93, a little bit worse for
the wear. It looks like if you cleaned her up and plugged the holes
she could float again.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said he and his team had been practicing for the
August dive in recent weeks. They have gone into the lake at night
to replicate conditions at 400 feet, where it is pitch black. And
they have been diving with special rigs enabling them to carry six
tanks each.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to see it to believe it,'' he said. ``We've
developed a sling system where we can carry two aluminum tanks
under each arm.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said the dive would be broadcast live on the Internet
and taped for a documentary that he hoped would air on the
Discovery Channel. Information on the team's upcoming adventure can
be found at www.diverssupport.com/sstahoe.htm.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER EXECUTIVE AND FAMILY SLAIN IN HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ A German family of four was stabbed to death
in the central Chinese city of Nanjing early Sunday, a rare
incident of violence against foreigners that underscores a creeping
rise in crime across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy general manager of a DaimlerChrysler luxury bus
manufacturing joint venture, Juergen Pfrang, discovered four
intruders in his house shortly after midnight Saturday, Chinese and
German officials said. Pfrang, 51, was stabbed during a struggle
with the men, who then killed his wife, 14-year old daughter and
12-year old son.
</P>
<P>
   Guards at the housing compound caught the men, four unemployed
farmers from nearby Anhui Province, according to the Nanjing
Foreign Affairs Bureau and the German consulate in Shanghai.
Robbery was the apparent motive.
</P>
<P>
   China has long been remarkably safe for foreigners. During the
1970s and 1980s, many travelers were amazed when lost wallets or
even plastic combs were returned to them by Chinese eager to
demonstrate the strength of their country's moral fiber. Most
foreign residents still don't think twice about wandering the
streets alone at any hour of the night in China.
</P>
<P>
   But a breakdown in central government control, growing income
disparities and rising unemployment have gradually led to more
crime. Several foreign businessmen were killed in the late 1990s.
Moreover, many Americans have felt less safe since NATO bombed the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last year during the Kosovo conflict.
The bombing, which few Chinese believe was accidental, sparked
violent demonstrations in several Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
   Most incidents of violence against foreigners have occurred in
smaller cities, where the foreign presence is small. But several
incidents in the past year have occurred in larger cities. Last
July, a Canadian man was hacked by a machete-wielding intruder to
his rented luxury villa in Shanghai. The man survived, but lost
partial use of one hand. And in January, a Chinese-American was
found slain in a Beijing bar.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the crime has been attributed to the droves of migrant
workers, many of them unemployed farmers, who have congregated in
China's cities looking for work. Beijing has tried various
strategies to control the tide, like leveling migrant shanty towns
and sending vagrants home. But as China's economy continues its
painful restructuring, the number of such workers grows.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In February, as many as 20,000 laid-off miners rioted in the
northeastern city of Yangjiazhanzi. And last month, train service
between Shanghai and Nanjing was interrupted for most of a day as
protesters who had lost money in a fraudulent financial scheme
blocked the rail tracks. Such flare-ups rarely touch the lives of
foreigners in China, and there is a debate among Western academics
about whether the increasing number of reported incidents indicates
growing social unrest or simply greater access to information about
events that previously might not have been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Two things are certain, however: unemployment is rising and _
infrequent as they still are _ reports of violence against
foreigners are more common than there were a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pfrang was deputy general manager of Yaxing-Benz Ltd., a joint
venture between DaimlerChrysler and Yangzhou Motor Coach
Manufacturing Co. Colleagues said Monday that although the company
is in Yangzhou, Pfrang lived with his family more than an hour away
in Nanjing so that his children could attend an international
school.
</P>
<P>
   The family had been in Nanjing since 1997, residing for most of
that time in a hotel until they moved last year to the Jingling
Royal Garden housing compound to give the children more room. Like
many compounds favored by foreign families in China, the Jingling
Royal Garden is a partly walled neighborhood of stand-alone houses.
</P>
<P>
   Such compounds are protected by security guards but are often
poorly patrolled.
</P>
<P>
   A German consular official from Shanghai traveled to Nanjing
Monday to arrange for repatriation of the bodies. The Pfrangs, from
the German city of Baden-Wurtemberg, have no other family members
in China.

FLAT, HUMORLESS AUTOBIOGRAPHY BARES ALL _ EXCEPT THE REAL CYBILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS PERRY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a scene in ``The Last Picture Show,'' Cybill Shepherd's
1971 screen debut, where the teen-aged Shepherd, buttoning and
straightening her clothes, storms out of a motel room in a rage,
disgusted with her boyfriend for not being able to perform on
command.
</P>
<P>
   Little did moviegoers know then how true that moment was for the
young actress. As Shepherd, now 50, relates _ repeatedly _ in her
autobiography, ``Cybill Disobedience'' (out this week from
HarperCollins), she has always been a girl who wants what she wants
when she wants it. And usually what she has wanted is sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the strictures of Southern womanhood were honed to a
fine edge in my family and I followed some of them flawlessly, I
never observed the sexual canons,'' writes the former Miss Teenage
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   She's not kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd's story, written with the help of author Aimee Lee
Ball, has more sexual adventures than ``Penthouse Letters.'' It
seems like every few pages, Shepherd is shaking off her clothes
like a wet dog and falling into bed (or onto a chair or the floor)
with celebrities ranging from Don Johnson to the man who brought
her to Hollywood, ``Last Picture Show'' director Peter Bogdanovich.
</P>
<P>
   But even though she professes to love her lust, Shepherd subtly
admits that the voracious coupling of her youth was more sadly
misguided than self-empowering. This is just as well, since her
sweaty exploits seem to have aroused little true passion in her _
even her description of a threesome she had with two men is
strangely detached.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shepherd's only moment of surprise in the bedroom comes
when a tryst fails to materialize, such as when she was hanging
with Elvis Presley shortly after she rocketed to stardom. (The
naive young Cybill was shocked to discover that the deteriorating
King preferred pills to starlets.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Shepherd would not describe her autobiography as a
sex book. She has other passions, too _ like filmmaking. A novice
when she arrived on the set of ``The Last Picture Show,'' she
suggests her affair with the married Bogdanovich was propelled and
sustained by the director's filmic, rather than sexual, prowess.
</P>
<P>
   A determined knowledge hound (she went to college after she
became a movie star), Shepherd became Bogdanovich's prize student.
When the director was putting together a film, Shepherd would spend
more time in the editing room than a moldy sandwich, even
outlasting Bogdanovich himself. (Coincidence or not, Bogdanovich's
career went into a tailspin during their relationship, with flops
like ``At Long Last Love,'' starring Shepherd.)
</P>
<P>
   Though known for her sense of humor, Shepherd writes flat,
humorless prose, deflating the shock value of her lurid stories.
After an interesting introduction to her life, the book's quality
follows the trajectory of her movie career in the late '70s,
spiraling into oblivion. The most compelling part of the book
should have been those difficult years when the actress, now a
single mom, was reduced to doing dinner theater and then, against
the odds, triumphantly returned to stardom on ``Moonlighting'' with
Bruce Willis and then on her own series, ``Cybill.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Shepherd likes the sound of her own voice too
much, as every success or failure leads to an often-unnecessary and
usually shallow tangent on feminism, loneliness or Hollywood's
antipathy toward women over 40.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the book, one anecdote from Shepherd's life,
originally related by Roger Ebert, lingers: Marlon Brando, after
enduring Shepherd's endless chatter at a Hollywood party in the
early '70s, leaned over to her companion and said, ``If she doesn't
shut up, I'm going to hit her in the face with a bottle.''

WATCHING THE COMEBACK AFTER THE STORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL HARRAL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My first real memories of tornadoes are of being dragged from
bed in the middle of the night by a mother insisting that we head
to the storm cellar to ride out the bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   We had the only cellar in the neighborhood, so it was a sort of
social gathering place during the terrible storms that sometimes
swept over the Texas Panhandle. It was a constant in my life from
my earliest memories until I moved away to college.
</P>
<P>
   My daddy was a cement contractor _ small time, small town.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways he made a living was building concrete storm
shelters. They cost about $500 at that time _ this would have been
in the late '50s.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't have one, of course. Just as the painter's house was
in need of painting and the carpenter's house was in need of
repair. The crafts people were so busy doing it for others that
they never got around to doing it for themselves. Our cellar was a
dugout covered by a wooden roof and a couple of feet of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Mom was a weather freak. Still is, mostly confined to her home
as she is at her advanced age. She watches the Weather Channel
faithfully and is prone to call to find out if we've been involved
in whatever weather is being reported.
</P>
<P>
   We beat her to the punch Tuesday night, calling to say that we
were OK before she even knew that we might have been in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The first tornado-damaged site I visited was just outside my
hometown _ Shamrock in the Texas Panhandle. My most striking memory
is seeing a water pipe neatly coiled around a small tree that stood
near the now-missing house.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, of course, because of my chosen profession, there
have been many more encounters with tornadoes. But they always
happened somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the things I always wondered was how people snap back
so fast and recover so quickly from natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   That question was answered in part last week.
</P>
<P>
   The main office of the Star-Telegram is located in downtown Fort
Worth. We also have major offices in Arlington and northeast
Tarrant County, so the downtown building is not as crucial to the
newspaper's production as it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are functions that are most easily performed in
that office.
</P>
<P>
   Since downtown was cordoned off last week, most of us had great
difficulty getting to work. Police and fire personnel were taking
their roles seriously, and the Star-Telegram wasn't high on their
radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative staff members recognized the problems we were
going to have getting people into a secure area, and they arranged
a shuttle bus service from the newspaper's Printing and
Distribution Center on the southern boundary of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   It was while waiting for one of the buses the first day after
the storm that a realization dawned about how recovery operations
happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Telegram is a big company, with about 1,300 full-time
employees with a lot of smaller operations within the major
divisions. We aren't thrown together all that much. Many different
divisions were represented at the shuttle stop.
</P>
<P>
   Some who worked in classified advertising were anxious to get to
work because they were afraid that the telephones they normally
staff would be going unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Some who worked in advertising special sections were alarmed
that their sections wouldn't be ready for the weekend unless they
could get into the office as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some responsible for the mail operations were determined to make
sure that the mail moved as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Those who worked in the editorial operation were desperate
because they knew the workload ahead, and they knew that those
already in the office needed all they help they could get.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to imply that the Star-Telegram is especially
unique. We do have a role during crises to see that we provide the
best information we can, and we are sensitive to that mission.
</P>
<P>
   But we didn't face any more than thousands of others who work in
downtown Fort Worth faced. And we were better off than many. At
least our building was intact.
</P>
<P>
   What was demonstrated in the crowd waiting for the shuttle,
however, is the stuff of which recovery is made. Each person was
focused on a mission and was determined to perform that mission in
the best way possible during the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   People doing what they are supposed to do are the people who
pull together things after a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   That's true of firefighters and police. And it is true of the
men and women of the Star-Telegram.

   MIAMI _ Microsoft faces an uncertain future as the wrath of the
U.S. government and its competitors finally starts to hit home. The
world's largest and most powerful software company is not going to
disappear, nor have we heard the last of Bill Gates, its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the pace of technology and the marketplace that the
antitrust case brought by the U.S. government may come to symbolize
the moment when the company's fortunes turned.
</P>
<P>
   The legal case is also coming to a climax at a critical time for
the new economy, the fusion of computers, software and the Internet
which Microsoft has helped to shape and create for the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is moving on; and Gates, one of the key architects of
the personal-computer revolution, was fighting to keep his company
on the cutting edge even without the legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   It is increasingly clear that the world of technology is just
beginning a vast process of reevaluation, and the stock declines
Monday _ which went beyond Microsoft _ are part of that.
</P>
<P>
   Much harder questions are starting to be asked about the ways
that business has been done; a critical eye is being cast on what
had been seen as innovation, but now looks in some cases like pure
hubris.
</P>
<P>
   The New Economy is entering what may be a troubled period.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is more associated with the New Economy than Gates. He
did not create the personal-computer revolution, but it was his
genius which helped to make the machines accessible to everyone.
His successes were in sales, marketing and promotion as much as (or
more than) in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's operating system, the company's first project, was
simple to use; so were the word processors, accounting software and
databases which followed. But the key was the operating system,
first MS-DOS, then Windows.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Gates owned the patent for the combustion engine in
the first industrial revolution. Everyone who wanted to make
software for the new machines needed to make it operate with
Microsoft products; so did everyone who sold computers. That gave
the company a hegemony which is only now being challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Microsoft scored its greatest successes, a second
technological revolution was brewing, the Internet, which
represented a quite different vision of computing.
</P>
<P>
   And the first, and initially the most successful, product to
explore this new world was made not by Microsoft, but by Netscape
Communications, an upstart company led by pioneer Jim Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government and Microsoft's competitors contend that the
company abused its dominant position in the market for operating
systems to gain a lockhold on the burgeoning market for browsers,
squeezing out Netscape and leaning on computer companies to co-opt
them in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to read the testimony _ even of Microsoft officials
_ and disagree, and in the end the judge concurred.
</P>
<P>
   This was a war, and one which Microsoft knew it had to win.
Browsers were the key to the new world of computing, one which
Microsoft had been late to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The case was about Microsoft's strength; but it was also about
how it dealt with a competitive weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The company won the browser war: in one sense, Monday's judgment
was about the past, not the future.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's market share has dwindled away; Internet Explorer,
the MS product, now reigns supreme. But the hubris which the
company displayed _ as it sought to eliminate or marginalize
rivals, and as it defended itself in court _ has cost it dearly.
</P>
<P>
   Companies the size of Microsoft don't die. Even if it were
broken up, it would still be vast and powerful; in any case, it
seems more likely to be shackled than dismembered, forced to
operate under external controls.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case its dominant position is coming to a close, as
much because of future technologies as past misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of new devices _ everything from set-top boxes
to handheld organizers and mobile phones _ opens up a market where
Gates' imperium does not hold sway.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Net itself, the big boxes that control the data
flows, and the much smaller ones which manage them, use other
software, and Microsoft has been slow to gain an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have been talking for a year about the post-PC
age; and that may come to mean post-Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   New competitors are already emerging to challenge Microsoft's
hegemony, using the open operating system Linux, for example; old
rivals, like Sun Microsystems, will try to capitalize on its
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no new Microsoft to replace the company: the
market is simply too variegated now. If Microsoft loses its grip,
in some areas there will be many competing products, and in the
short term it may be harder for consumers to work out which one
will survive.
</P>
<P>
   When empires fade, strange and sometimes destructive energies
are freed. &QL;

 By RICHARD LLOYD PARRY  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan was thrown into political and constitutional
confusion Monday as its prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, appeared to
be close to death after suffering a sudden stroke over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a day of obfuscation, the acting prime minister,
Miko Aoki, finally admitted that Obuchi had fallen into a coma late
on Sunday and was being kept alive on a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and the Japanese media were careful not to rule out
his chances of recovery, but it appears likely that the 62-year old
prime minister will never wake up, creating a sudden and unexpected
void in the leadership of the world's second richest country.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) were
already discussing his successor last night, and the government was
quick to emphasize that his demise will have no effect on Japan's
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the tragedy has created a unique and constitutionally
baffling situation _ how to secure the resignation of a prime
minister who is not yet dead, but who may never speak or move
again.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary chain of events began on Saturday when, after
months of bickering and recrimination, the leaders of the minority
Liberal Party (LP) announced that they were abandoning his
three-party coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the negotiations appears to have taken it out of
Obuchi, who also had to deal with the eruption of a volcano in the
northern island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the prime minister's office initially claimed that
he spent much of Sunday working at home. In fact he had been
hospitalized at 1 a.m., 22 hours before an official announcement
was made late on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, in a peremptory press conference, Aoki, the
chief cabinet secretary, announced that Obuchi had suffered a
stroke and had asked him to take acting leadership. A few hours
later, he admitted that Obuchi was unconscious and breathing only
by artificial means.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 13 hours, from Sunday night to Monday morning,
Japan was without a conscious head of government.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutionally, a prime minister can be permanently replaced
after his resignation, but the laws give no guidance about how to
deal with an incumbent who is incapable of expressing his will.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it is difficult for the premier to make his own
decisions,'' a bemused Aoki observed. ``We will have to decide what
to do after considering his condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional experts speak of a scenario in which LDP leaders
``simulate'' Obuchi's decision to resign, before appointing a new
party head who will then be elected prime minister by the
government's parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably not be Aoki, a reserved party stalwart who has
never shown obvious ambitions to be prime minister.
</P>

<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan was thrown into political and constitutional
confusion Monday as its prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, appeared to
be close to death after suffering a sudden stroke over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a day of obfuscation, the acting prime minister,
Miko Aoki, finally admitted that Obuchi had fallen into a coma late
on Sunday and was being kept alive on a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and the Japanese media were careful not to rule out
his chances of recovery, but it appears likely that the 62-year old
prime minister will never wake up, creating a sudden and unexpected
void in the leadership of the world's second richest country.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) were
already discussing his successor last night, and the government was
quick to emphasize that his demise will have no effect on Japan's
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the tragedy has created a unique and constitutionally
baffling situation _ how to secure the resignation of a prime
minister who is not yet dead, but who may never speak or move
again.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary chain of events began on Saturday when, after
months of bickering and recrimination, the leaders of the minority
Liberal Party (LP) announced that they were abandoning his
three-party coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the negotiations appears to have taken it out of
Obuchi, who also had to deal with the eruption of a volcano in the
northern island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the prime minister's office initially claimed that
he spent much of Sunday working at home. In fact he had been
hospitalized at 1 a.m., 22 hours before an official announcement
was made late on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, in a peremptory press conference, Aoki, the
chief cabinet secretary, announced that Obuchi had suffered a
stroke and had asked him to take acting leadership. A few hours
later, he admitted that Obuchi was unconscious and breathing only
by artificial means.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 13 hours, from Sunday night to Monday morning,
Japan was without a conscious head of government.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutionally, a prime minister can be permanently replaced
after his resignation, but the laws give no guidance about how to
deal with an incumbent who is incapable of expressing his will.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it is difficult for the premier to make his own
decisions,'' a bemused Aoki observed. ``We will have to decide what
to do after considering his condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional experts speak of a scenario in which LDP leaders
``simulate'' Obuchi's decision to resign, before appointing a new
party head who will then be elected prime minister by the
government's parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably not be Aoki, a reserved party stalwart who has
never shown obvious ambitions to be prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the favorite appeared to be Yoshiro Mori, the
LDP's secretary-general, or the foreign minister, Yohei Kono, with
an outsider's chance for Kiichi Miyazawa, the octogenarian finance
minister, who served as premier in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis comes at a fraught time for Japan, which is showing
faltering signs of recovery from its worst recession in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The LDP's tiny majority forced it to form a coalition with the

been the source of much bickering.
</P>
<P>
   There was more than a suggestion Monday that Obuchi's sudden

   BEIJING _ A mother of a student killed in the 1989 crackdown on
democracy demonstrators was detained by the police on Monday as she
tried to deliver gifts to a leading organizer of victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   The detained woman, Su Bingxian, was trying to deliver a book
and $1,000 in donations for families of people killed in the 1989
crackdown to Ding Zilin, a professor at People's University who
also lost a son when the army crushed the demonstrations in
Tiananmen Square and has organized aid efforts for bereaved
families.
</P>
<P>
   The book and money had been brought by Lois Wheeler Snow, the
79-year-old widow of the journalist Edgar Snow, who was lauded here
as a ``friend of China'' for his sympathetic writings. On Saturday,
Snow was prevented by the police from visiting Ding and giving her
the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   As Snow was blocked at the university gate on Saturday, Su
emerged to accept the gifts on Ding's behalf. But on Monday, when
she tried to deliver the book and money to Ding, she was detained,
Ding said in a letter faxed to foreign reporters. On Monday night,
Su's telephone went unanswered and it was unclear if she was still
being held.

NEW MOB SERIES `FALCONE' TREADS LINE BETWEEN MORALITY PLAY AND GORE
FEST
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by FALCONE-PREDECESSORS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first scene of CBS' gutsy but wildly uneven ``Falcone''
shows a man gleefully bursting through the doors of a ballroom only
to find empty chairs and tables scattered about. Figuring
something's amiss, he turns to find a man blocking the doorway and
pointing a large shotgun at his face. We hear the boom and must
imagine the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' is a cops and mob series that takes its violence
seriously, if not cautiously. Vicious stabbings, terrible beatings
and cold-blooded murders carry viewers through the first episodes
of this highly anticipated drama, including a stylistically juicy
slow-motion ambush where three men are gunned down at point-blank
range in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a series that CBS has taken tremendous pains to
protect and nurture, first shelving its initial debut last year
when the Colorado shootings threatened to make the project a pubic
relations fiasco, and later making the decision to launch it during
midseason, when audiences are expected to be game for something _
anything _ fresh and new.
</P>
<P>
   What CBS and the show's creators don't want is for the violence,
however necessary it may be, to tell the story, to be its calling
card. Instead, the network's aspiration is a series that's more
morality play than shoot'em-up.
</P>
<P>
   To push home that point, CBS is taking the unusual step of
airing nine episodes over eight nights, beginning Tuesday with a
two-hour opener. This strategy is driven by a combination of fear
and hope. Fear that audiences might not return to such a dark and
dispiriting series after a week's time; hope that viewers tuning in
on consecutive nights will be hooked by the show's driving momentum
and compelling premise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' is loosely based on the 1997 film ``Donnie Brasco''
and the true story of Joe Pistone, an FBI undercover agent who, in
the mid-'70s, infiltrated the Mafia, getting closer to its inner
circle than had any previous law enforcer. Pistone, who serves as a
consultant on ``Falcone,'' spent 28 years with the FBI, six of them
infiltrating a mob family. Adopting the persona of a hard-nosed
jewel thief, he became part of the clan, proving his loyalty by
participating in crimes both petty and bloody.
</P>
<P>
   Portrayed by Jason Gedrick, whose stern-but-pretty face has led
to a number of mobster roles, Falcone is the ultimate method actor,
a man with many faces and even more lies. He shuttles between his
families, the one he works for and the one he tucks away in a
suburban house on a quiet street. Loyalty is the core issue in both
places, which is an added irony since Falcone, who's so good at
winning trust, is at once the most honest man and the ultimate
betrayer.
</P>
<P>
   The opening episode sets up this life of tightrope walking
pretty methodically. After the head don is rubbed out (remember the
shotgun to the head?), a fight for control ensues between ruthless
underbosses Santino ``Sonny Boy'' Napoli (Titus Welliver) and
Victor Mura (James Russo), who appear to hate one another with true
passion. Falcone must align himself with one of them; picking the
wrong one will not just push him out of position to collect enough
evidence to bring down the family, it will get him killed.
</P>
<P>
   Falcone reports to FBI field agent Jules, played by Robert John
Burke, who doesn't like Falcone's relentless risk-taking but takes
a better-him-than-me attitude. He appears to be more worried about
Falcone's family than Falcone, who has many other things to fret
about, including being constantly hounded by District Attorney
Francesca Gold, played by a growling Patti LuPone.
</P>
<P>
   Falcone's family scenes, filled with tense ambivalence, are what
give the series its most original energy. Amy Carlson plays Maggie
as a saintly, long-suffering spouse who understands his duty but
only to a point. His oldest daughter is sullen and untrusting of
Falcone; she knows something odd is occurring and that it hurts her
mother terribly. Her icy relationship with her father contrasts
with that between Falcone and his younger daughter, who is naive
enough to miss her father when he disappears for days and to love
him during his rare nights at home as a regular guy. (To keep the
mob off-balance, he keeps an apartment and has his phone forwarded
to a cellphone when at home.)
</P>
<P>
   As ``Falcone'' goes deeper into its story lines, the creators
are hoping audiences will get sucked up into the dramatic ambiguity
of it all _ whether, for instance, Falcone is so immersed in a
dangerous and confusing double life that his cause becomes less
clear to him. Is his loyalty only to the law? His wife and two
daughters? His Mafia clan?
</P>
<P>
   In one of the pivotal scenes, Falcone gets a call informing him
that Maggie's car has been blindsided and that she's been rushed to
the hospital. Needing to leave the bar hangout where the mobsters
spend much of their time, he invents a story about meeting a
business acquaintance in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Falcone is questioned by one of Sonny's disapproving henchmen,
who demands that Falcone verify the Miami contact right then and
there.
</P>
<P>
   As they call Miami, and as sweat begins to dance across
Falcone's forehead, it's clear that it is this kind of threat of
exposure that the show's creators hope will keep audiences tuned in
once the series shifts to its weekly time slot.
</P>
<P>
   While the series does its best to tread new ground, it's hardly
new _ not only does it owe its story line to ``Donnie Brasco,'' it
also draws inspiration from ``Wiseguy,'' an '80s drama on ABC that
starred Ken Wahl as an undercover agent assigned to infiltrate and
bring down criminal conspiracies. That series was quite cerebral
for a cop show and was well-received by critics. But it also never
amassed sizable ratings, dying after four seasons and some
behind-the-scenes turmoil that resulted in Wahl's firing before the
final season.
</P>
<P>
   But neither ``Wiseguy'' nor ``Donnie Brasco'' is the ghost
``Falcone'' needs to worry about. Fairly or not, the new series
will be compared to ``The Sopranos,'' the mob show that has sent
orgasmic tremors through the press since its premiere last year,
and is now HBO's highest-rated original series. That's hardly
welcome news for ``Falcone,'' considering that the raw, R-rated
ferocity of the pay-channel series is the exact thing ``Falcone''
cannot offer.
</P>
<P>
   But the expectations of ``Sopranos''' fans aren't its only
problem. Even while executive producer Mark Johnson stresses that
the show is ``far more interested in an undercover FBI agent who
leads a life in which any small misstep will get him killed than in
laying out how a gangster society works,'' ``Falcone'' often falls
short in its attempts to at least capture the cultural and social
nuances of mob life.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, dialogue sometimes comes off sounding more like a
``Saturday Night Live'' skit than a grittily realistic drama. ``I'm
a tough guy, Sonny,'' says Raymond ``The Madman'' Ricci, played by
an overacting Eric Roberts. ``But my tough guyness is all soft
because my hands are tied behind my back.''
</P>
<P>
   And this, from Victor to Falcone when sides are being drawn.
``Either you get on the boat with me,'' he warns, ``or you drown
with the rest of the victims.'' (He delivers this exact line
moments later to another guy who gave him the wrong answer and was
stabbed repeatedly with what looked like an ice pick.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone's'' list of Mafia members and wiseguys is a long one,
but none of the criminal sidekicks stands out as an original
creation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not that changes remains to be seen. With the
real-life Pistone serving as consultant, ``Falcone'' plans to use
``Donnie Brasco'' as a starting point and then draw from many of
Pistone's other experiences that never made it into the film.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this matters if no one watches. It should be
noted that CBS was also the home of ``EZ Streets,'' another
multilayered series with mob overtones that also co-starred
Gedrick, as an ex-convict trying to go straight. That series was
adored by critics and ignored by viewers, who found its plot lines
convoluted and less than engaging. It died a rather quick death,
even after CBS, figuring it could prove its worth over time,
brought it back with a promotional push.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``EZ Streets,'' ``Falcone'' is the sort of show that needs
time to grow. It could become a rich, nuanced drama that finds a
committed audience _ or it could drown with the rest of the
victims.

SOME ACES HAVE ROTATED DOWN FROM THE NO. 1 SLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ An ace is not forever.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to compile a list of big league pitchers who went from
stopper to plugger.
</P>
<P>
   Young flamethrowers never think it will happen. They have the
juice in their arm that allows them to overpower hitters when
nothing else is working. Bases loaded? No outs? No problem. Just
turn it up a notch and strike out the side.
</P>
<P>
   An ace pitcher is like an only child. The single son or daughter
learns that the whole world revolves around him or her. A pitching
staff stopper is similarly indulged. Every other pitcher on the
team steps aside to accommodate the big kahuna. If there's a
rainout, other pitchers skip their turn to allow the ace to start
on his regular fifth day.
</P>
<P>
   Life can be difficult when one loses this premier status. Some
can make the adjustment, others cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens at the end of the 1999 season was the No. 4
starter in the vaunted Yankees rotation. Orlando Hernandez, David
Cone, and Andy Pettitte had earned the right to pitch ahead of the
Rocket, which is how Clemens wound up pitching the fourth and
clinching game of the Yankees' World Series sweep against the
Atlanta Braves. In New York last autumn, Clemens had the same role
for the Yankees that Kent Mercker did for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser and Dwight Gooden went from ace to average. And
what about Boston's own Jeff Fassero? It's hard to believe now, but
Fassero at one time was the ace on a Montreal staff that had Pedro
Martinez and on a Seattle staff that had Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Injury is usually the reason an ace loses his status. Think of
Frank Tanana back in the 1970s and '80s. He was a high-octane
lefthander when he came to the big leagues, but arm problems made
him a snowflake specialist for the second half of his career. In
the late '70s, he was the most effective hurler on an Angels staff
that included Nolan Ryan, but a decade later he was a nifty backup
to Detroit ace Jack Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Don Gullett was the ace of the 1975 world champion Reds. Manager
Sparky Anderson announced, ``After the seventh game of the World
Series, Don Gullett is going to the Hall of Fame.'' It never
happened. Gullett hurt his arm, went to the Yankees, but never won
20 and finished with 109 wins (and only 50 losses) in nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the transition from ace to average, Gullett said,
``Obviously it's devastating enough psychologically. You see a lot
of guys that have physical problems where they're not what they
used to be. Those guys have got to have a mindset where they're
going to go out and learn how to pitch with less than their best
stuff. I think it shows the dedication and hard work a guy puts
forth to get the same results out of less stuff. I think a lot of
guys work their way back and can't get it together. They can't
psychologically make the adjustment when they don't throw as hard
as they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be a huge adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen won the Cy Young Award and the seventh game of
the World Series for the Royals when he was 21 years old. He won
another Cy four years later when he was 23-6. Then came arm
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never considered myself the ace,'' he said. ``I considered
myself a guy the team relied on when I went out to get a win. An
ace? That's for other people to talk about. We had Mark Gubicza,
Danny Jackson, Bud Black, Charlie Leibrandt, Kevin Appier. We had a
lot of quality pitchers when I pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   He's being modest. The Royals did have a deep staff, but
Saberhagen was No. 1. The 1980 Orioles had 25-game winner Steve
Stone, plus reigning Cy Young Mike Flanagan and a couple of stars
named Scott McGregor and Dennis Martinez. But Jim Palmer was still
the ace. Three Cy Youngs create privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Ego comes into play. It's one thing for a fireballer to learn
how to win with location and craftiness. Accepting a No. 2 or 3
role can be another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen said, ``It was an easy transition for me _ people
calling me an ace then and now a No. 2 or No. 3 pitcher. As long as
the team feels it's going to win when I'm pitching, that's all I
care about. And I'll pitch as long as I feel that. When the time
comes when people are going, `Oh no, Saberhagen's pitching today,'
then it's time to back away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullett said, ``You've really got to take a look in the mirror.
Look in the mirror at yourself and look at what's ahead of you. You
have to be man enough to figure that out and see for yourself. You
have to understand and accept that and say to the new guy, `You're
the man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Stewart, who was an ace with both the Blue Jays and Oakland
A's, said, ``I think if you're being realistic, you understand
where you are. Coming into the latter part of your career, you
recognize the fact that you're not capable of doing the things that
a No. 1 guy does. You accept the role. In the end, you recognize
who is the No. 1 guy on the staff. I think Clemens started to
recognize where he was on that staff last year. Most of those guys
had more playoff experience than he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan has the ace of aces in Pedro
Martinez, but he also has three other starters who once were aces
on other staffs: Ramon Martinez (Dodgers), Fassero (Expos and
Mariners), and Saberhagen (Royals).
</P>
<P>
   ``I still treat 'em with respect,'' said Kerrigan. ``You've got
to respect what a guy like Saberhagen has done for the game of
baseball and what he's done for us the last couple of years. That's
the way you treat Ramon, too. You treat Ramon like he's the man.
And Fassero. I think you have to treat those people with the
respect like they are still No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   This can be easier said than done. Ultimately, the job of the
manager and pitching coach is to get the maximum number of starts
from the ace, which come at the expense of other starters,
including erstwhile aces.
</P>
<P>
   Gullett said, ``If you have that front-line absolute stopper _
and there are very few of those guys in the game today _ I would
feel comfortable putting everything on a guy like that. It's the
right thing to do. You want him to have the proper amount of rest.
If there's an off day or a rainout, you're not gonna back your
horse up an extra day. If you figure that happens three or four
times during the season, you get an extra start out of a guy and it
makes common sense to tell you that every time you get a chance to
put him out there with a proper amount of rest, you're gonna put
him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   How do the other veterans feel about being skipped to
accommodate the ace?
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened to me in Los Angeles and Montreal,'' said Pedro.
``It's OK. I didn't mind it. That's up to the manager. I will
always do whatever the manager decides.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen said, ``The manager's got to take into account if
that's best for the team or best for the individual. It's not a fun
thing to be skipped, and if it happened to me I wouldn't be too
happy, but you've got to look at it as a team, and not as an
individual. If it's best for the team, that's what's gotta happen.
You can't always be looking out for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart added, ``When I was with the Dodgers, I was behind Don
Sutton. When you have a staff that's working for the same thing _
to win and get to championship play, you want to get your No. 1 guy
out there as much as you can. In Oakland they understood I'd go on
the fourth day and sometimes I'd go back-to-back on the fourth day.
It doesn't really affect the other guys. It shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing the ability to overpower hitters is the other adjustment
that comes when you are no long No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never do what Frank Tanana did,'' said Saberhagen.
``He went from power to finesse, and that's tough to do. If I can't
still throw the ball by people at times, I couldn't keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Gullett added, ``I think we all take that for granted that
you're invincible and an injury can never happen to me. But it's a
fact that every pitch you make could be your last pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro offers this tantalizing prospect regarding his big
brother:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a No. 1 still. Ramon hasn't pitched healthy, but
if he is healthy he can be the No. 1 starter. I wish I could give
Ramon my spot, because that would make us so much better. Imagine
Ramon coming to the level I am now and becoming the ace. Me as the
No. 2 starter. That would be a lot of fun.''

PITCHERS ARE EVEN MORE VALUABLE THAN HOME-RUN KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home run hitters, Pete Rose once moaned, drive the Cadillacs.
Since even backup catchers travel in style now, Rose probably would
have to amend that statement to say the home run hitters get the
Mercedes dealerships. They also get the chicks, according to a
popular TV ad that ran last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's a World Series ring you're after, the bashers are
not your best bet. The last home run champion to play in a World
Series was Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt, and that was for the
Phillies 20 years ago. You have to go back to the 1985 Kansas City
Royals and Steve ``Bye Bye'' Balboni to find a World Series champ
with a 35-home run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But since the 1961 expansion, pitchers who led their leagues in
winning percentage have gone to the World Series 27 times, 15 times
in the American League, a dozen times in the National.
</P>
<P>
   The game may be homer-happy _ a record 5,528 baseballs were
launched out of major league parks last season _ but for October
memories, there's nothing like an ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ace dominates you,'' said Dave Stewart, the Toronto Blue
Jays' assistant general manager who routinely destroyed the Red Sox
and their ace, Roger Clemens, when he pitched for the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changes losing streaks into winning streaks. He's the guy
who starts the first game of the playoffs and the guy who starts
the last game of the playoffs. He's the guy who lets everyone know
on his team that everything's OK. He's the one who tells his team,
`If I'm out there against the other team's No. 1 guy, I'll be the
last one standing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The epitome of an ace in 1999, even though his team fell one
step short of the World Series, was Pedro Martinez, who won 23
games, twice more in the postseason, and had an earned run average
of 2.07, less than half the league average of 4.86.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the
game,'' said Jim Leyland, the former manager of the Pirates,
Marlins, and Rockies now working as a special assistant for the
Cardinals. ``I guarantee you, when Jimy Williams gets in his car to
go to the ballpark on the days Pedro pitches, he knows he's going
to win that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Mark McGwire or Pedro Martinez? Apples and
oranges, you say?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, except by this measure. In games in which McGwire homered
last season, the Cardinals went 24-32, a .429 winning percentage.
In games in which Martinez started, the Red Sox went 24-5, a
winning percentage of .828. All the Red Sox had to do was a little
better than split the games Martinez didn't start, and they
finished with 94 wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We people have a tendency to want to put a person in that
(all-time) category before his time,'' said Hall of Famer Bob
Gibson, who in 1968 had a season even more spectacular than
Martinez's, winning 22 games, including 13 shutouts, and
registering a 1.12 earned run average, third-lowest in big-league
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he quit today, then what would he be at the end of a
career? That's when you have to assess it. You can't do that now.
But does he have some of the best stuff you've ever seen? Yep,
'cause he does. But you need to wait before making judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How to define an ace?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many of them there are,'' said Phillies
righthander Curt Schilling, who would make most everyone's short
list, ``but I've always believed they're like the days of the week.
If you can't name them off the tip of your tongue, then they're not
an ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you have to earn and you have to maintain. It's
not, win 20 games and be an ace. It's going out there and having
the other team saying, `Oh no, this guy is throwing today,' which
I'm sure is what is done when Pedro pitches. Randy Johnson. Kevin
Brown. Greg Maddux. Mike Mussina. Guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ace comes in every variety of packaging. There is the
6-foot-10-inch Johnson, the Arizona lefthander who seems as if he
can almost reach inside a hitter's shirt before releasing his
ferocious fastball. Maddux, the methodical Atlanta artist, pitches
as if he lives inside a hitter's head. Clemens, the tough Texan,
now relies on his splitter as much as his fastball to buckle a
hitter's knees. And Martinez, the diminutive Dominican, has the
stuff and the will to break a hitter's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a freak of nature,'' Schilling said of Martinez. ``He's
small, but he has the long arms and big hands that go with being a
power pitcher. Because English is his second language, people don't
understand that Pedro knows how to pitch. He understands how to
pitch. I've watched him time and time again, and above his stuff is
the fact he knows how to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated recently noted that Whitey Ford is the only
pitcher in the Hall of Fame who is under 6 feet tall. Martinez is
listed at 5-11, and that's generous. It's also irrelevant,
according to Don Gullett, a barely 6-footer who threw a 95
mile-an-hour fastball in pitching both the Reds and Yankees to the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on how a guy is put together and how he goes
about doing his job,'' said Gullett, now the pitching coach for the
Cincinnati Reds. ``Pedro Martinez probably throws harder than
anybody around, other than Randy Johnson. And look at the contrast.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Pedro has is a God-given gift. The guy that small, he
creates that type of velocity by using his entire body. It's not
all arm. It's the physical leverage that he gets from his legs and
his torso, the torque he gets. Plus, he also has tremendous arm
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have won three of the last four World Series,
finished eighth in the American League in home runs last season,
but their fourth starter was a five-time Cy Young Award winner,
Clemens. At 37, he may not be the ace he once was, but his place is
secure on the All-Century Team, not to mention Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Clemens, the Yankees have a perfect-game pitcher in
David Cone, a new Mr. October in Orlando Hernandez, and a
lefthander, Andy Pettitte, who would be a No. 1 on lesser clubs.
Throw in their unhittable closer, Mariano Rivera, and is it any
wonder they've won 18 of their last 19 postseason games?
</P>
<P>
   The team the Yankees beat in the Series, the Atlanta Braves, was
outscored by six National League teams last season, but still won
its eighth straight division title and fifth pennant of the '90s.
How? Miss Gandy's third graders can recite the reasons faster than
their multiplication tables: Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine,
complemented over time by Steve Avery, Denny Neagle, and now Kevin
Millwood, who may be the ace-in-waiting, especially with Smoltz out
for the season after elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Not every good pitcher, Leyland emphasizes, can be an ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys pitch successfully until the bright lights are
on all the time,'' he said. ``There are only so many guys confident
enough to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ace, Gibson said, embraces the burden of being depended upon
by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's a responsibility you have to take on,
but it's an attitude you have,'' said the man who beat the Red Sox
three times in the 1967 World Series, including Game 7. ``Some guys
don't want the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as an ace, you still have to pitch and win without your
good stuff. I've got to be out there. That's an attitude you have.
You learn that you go out there no matter what, because the team
needs you.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are so good, even when they're going half-speed
they're still better than the other guys. (Martinez) happens to be
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An ace, Schilling said, can win a game even before he steps on
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that absolutely,'' he said. ``I thought, when I
watched Pedro come in that game in Cleveland, I thought the game
was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling was referring to what already has passed into legend
in Boston, the fifth game of the Division Series against the
Indians when Martinez, despite a strained muscle in the back of his
shoulder, came out of the bullpen in Jacobs Field and threw six
hitless innings against the highest-scoring team in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the Indians gave up,'' Schilling said, ``but
there's a defeatist attitude when you face a guy like that. It's
like what's happening on the PGA Tour with Tiger Woods. Instead of
figuring out what you're going to do with your bat, you say, `What
are we going to do tomorrow, because there's no way we can win
today.'
</P>
<P>
   ``An ace has an aura. He doesn't have to have his `A' stuff to
win. He wins on most days even when he doesn't have his best stuff.
Before the season starts, if you ask me how many games I'm going to
win, I can't tell you. But every time I get the ball I honestly
believe I'm going to win that night. Something weird is going to
have to happen for me not to win. That's the way I've always
felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling may be accused of having a pitcher's bias. Not so Hal
McRae, the former outfielder who starred on the terrific Kansas
City Royals teams of the '70s and '80s. An ace, McRae said, makes
as much of an impact on his own dugout as he does on the opposing
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about it in the cage,'' said McRae, now the
hitting coach for the Phillies. ``Teammates get up for the ace.
They play better defense. They're more alert. Their concentration
is at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition fears the ace. They know it's going to be a
tough ballgame. The opposing manager fears the ace. He hates to run
his ace against your ace. He'd prefer to use him the day before or
after, so he doesn't waste a good effort by his ace and lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives your club a lift when your No. 1 pitches. You know
you can beat anyone. You know you don't have to score eight runs
and still have a better-than-average chance to win today. Maybe
today you won't have to grind quite as much. Over the long haul of
162 games, if you feel like you've got to grind every day, it's
going to wear you down.''
</P>
<P>
   An ace doesn't wear you down. If his name is Pedro Martinez, he
can lift up a team, a town, a Red Sox Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like him,'' Gullett said, ``come along once in a
lifetime.''

FORMER HURLERS ARE ON TRARGET WITH ANALYSIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox were in New York to play the Mets last season, and
it was Pedro Martinez's turn to pitch. Hall of Famer Tom Seaver was
at Shea Stadium to work the game as a color analyst for the Mets'
carrier, WPIX, and while walking through a tunnel underneath the
stadium, he saw Martinez with an entourage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a walking press conference,'' Seaver recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, however, surprised Seaver. The Red Sox' star
righthander noticed Seaver and broke away from the crowd to come
over and introduce himself. That made a strong impression on
Seaver, who was quite a pitcher himself in his days with the Mets,
Reds, White Sox, and briefly Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a huge Pedro fan,'' Seaver said. ``Not just as a
professional but as a man. He knows the history of the game and
also knows that there were men before him as there will be men
after him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the circle was complete. Back in his playing days,
when Seaver had crowds following him around, something similar
happened at Shea Stadium. Seaver's boyhood idol, Sandy Koufax, was
on hand to call the game for NBC. Seaver broke away from his pack
and introduced himself. ``I was scared to death,'' Seaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Color commentators make their mark by providing viewers with
interesting anecdotes and insightful analysis. Seaver is one such
commentator. Jim Kaat is another. Both former pitchers downplay the
fact that their positions afforded them unique perspective during
their playing days, but it's clear that viewers are the better for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Kaat, who calls Yankees games for Madison Square Garden Network,
said he picked up the skill of calling games when he sat in the
bullpen on days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers and catchers have a good perspective on all aspects
of the game,'' Kaat said. ``We pitch, we field, and before the
designated hitter rule, we also hit a little. All of those things
give us an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in the small Michigan town of Zeeland (pop.
4,000), the 61-year-old Kaat has a quiet voice that lends itself
nicely to baseball, much like the radio announcers of old. MSG has
all the new technological bells and whistles, but he doesn't like
them much. He prefers the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to make viewers feel like they are at the ballpark,''
Kaat said. ``I try to give them a sense of what Joe Torre is
thinking in the dugout. I want viewers to be as close to the game
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaat played in the major leagues for 25 years, so, as he says,
``There's not a lot I haven't seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his TV days began in 1981, Kaat has worked alongside
play-by-play men such as Greg Gumbel, Jack Buck, and Dick Stockton.
Buck gave him some valuable advice: ``Never tell anyone how easy
this is.''
</P>
<P>
   As analysts, Seaver said, former pitchers have more to add.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole game hinges on pitching,'' Seaver said. ``It's the
one constant. No team can win without good pitching. Blowout games
may be exciting for the middle-of-the-road fan who wants to see a
lot of action. But for those fans who like the intricacies of the
game, pitchers' duels are the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver has been around the broadcast booth for a while, too. He
was with ABC when it had baseball in the '70s, and though the
network didn't stay with the sport long, it was long enough for
Seaver to call the World Series with Howard Cosell. Seaver later
worked for NBC with Tony Kubek and Joe Garagiola.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver majored in journalism at Southern Cal, but nothing really
prepared him for the broadcast booth except practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My producers tell me all the time to not be afraid of being
too complex,'' Seaver said. ``Viewers will either get it or they
won't. But most will look at a game differently as a result. The
more the viewer understands about a game, the more they will
appreciate the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Seaver said, there are usually five key outs that
a team needs to win a close ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch how pitchers throw when a man is on base as opposed to
when no one is on and there are two outs,'' Seaver said. ``It's all
sorts of different situations depending on the pitcher, what's
working for him that day or that inning, what batter is up, and
what the game situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting an out is not always about striking a batter out or
having the best stuff. ``An out is an out,'' Seaver said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kaat, Seaver is not a big fan of gadgets and graphics in
broadcasts; he prefers to rely on description to tell the story.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver, 55, took a lot of criticism last year when he accepted
the job at WPIX after the team fired the outspoken Tim McCarver.
Seaver was called a house man.
</P>
<P>
   Quite naturally, he disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job to be critical just for the sake of being
critical,'' Seaver said. ``I have never been told what to say or
how to say it. I say the same things on the air as I did on the
field. And besides, the fans are not coming to the game to be
hypercritical or listen to a hypercritical commentator. Most people
want to relax and have fun.''

NETENCLATURE: A NEW WORLD OF NAMES BEFORE THE DOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 9)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's say you wanted to set up a Web site containing the
complete works of William Shakespeare, or commenting on the use of
bawdy language in his plays, or selling your closetfuls of souvenir
Shakespeare busts.
</P>
<P>
   What would you name it? How about something simple and direct,
like  &UR; shakespeare.com &LR; ? First you have to see if it has already
been taken. Every name has to be registered with the Domain Name
System, which translates names into the Internet protocol numbers
that route all the computers in the world to a chosen address.
</P>
<P>
   You start by checking with Network Solutions Inc., registrar of
more than 8 million domain names, or one of its 90 or so rivals
that have sprung up since competition was permitted in the past
year. You discover that your proposed  &UR; shakespeare.com  &LR; is already
taken by a dreary word-play gamester and  &UR; shakespeare.org  &LR; is the
site of a nice company of thespians in Lenox, Mass. Also taken are
 &UR; thebard.org  &LR; and  &UR; stratford-upon-avon.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Some seeming Shakespearean sites are not Bard related:
 &UR; soundfury.com  &LR; lays not on Macbeth but on music, and
 &UR; killalllawyers.com  &LR; is not an analysis of a slanderous crack by a
villain in ``Henry VI'' but a compilation of lawyer jokes. (Lawyers
sensitive to this relentless spoofing find fun being made of other
people on  &UR; hardyharhar.com &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   You will find that almost all famous names are already taken by
people who were quicker than you. These name claimants either
conduct business or educate the world under that domain name,
unless they are  &UR; cybersquatters &LR; , grabbing the most salable words
and well-known names for sale to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   One enterprising outfit, claiming it was merely protecting me
from predatory types warehousing names for sale, ``owned''
 &UR; williamsafire.com &LR; , and I had to pay to reclaim my identity. (Few
others wanted my name, which was somewhat deflating but lucky for
me.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some 90 percent of the most common words in English are
already claimed by the fast operators of ``netenclature,'' my
unregistered appellation for the Internet-naming business or
racket. For details on the way the naming system works, click on
 &UR; ICANNWatch.org &LR; , a private organization that keeps an eye on the
government-sanctioned Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers. (A domain name for fed-up television viewers or opponents
of voyeurism would be  &UR; ICANTwatch &LR; , surely not registered yet.)
</P>
<P>
   What's in a name? As Shakespeare's Juliet discovered, plenty.
This department's interest is in the more creative names now
dotting the linguistic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Some are thoughtful: A site dealing with general semantics,
often illustrating the differentiation of words, is
 &UR; thisisnothat.com &LR; . Others compress a readily understandable
message into a new compound:  &UR; bibliofind.com &LR; , for example, uses
the Greek  &UR; biblion &LR; , ``book,'' which bibliophiles know, with the
English verb  &UR; to find &LR;  _ you use this Web site to find old books.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who want access to official White House transcripts
and pictures of the first family do not use the correct ``top
domain'' (the suffixlike three letters after the dot). Instead of
punching in  &UR; whitehouse.gov &LR; , which would get them a smiling face
of President Clinton, they mistakenly use  &UR; whitehouse.com &LR; . This
takes them to a site that a pornography distributor shrewdly
glommed onto. (It was a commercial trick, not a GOP plot.)
</P>
<P>
   I have not checked this out because I am writing this on a New
York Times computer at the office and can envision the oh-yeah
smirk on the face of systems support when I sputter out an
explanation that this search lasting several hours was only in
furtherance of my scholarly duty.
</P>
<P>
   But Web criticism, especially self-criticism, is clearly
labeled.  &UR; Worstoftheweb.com &LR;  competes with the more informal
 &UR; webpagesthatsuck.com &LR; . License-plate messaging has been adopted by
domain namers:  &UR; Ubid.com &LR;  is an auction site;  &UR; 4800number.com &LR; 
helps you find an 800-number;  &UR; uexpress.com &LR;  leads you to the free
expressions of some columnists.
</P>
<P>
   Some names are registered by groups that want to protect their
members from offense. There is a  &UR; nigger.com  &LR; registered, property
of the NAACP, to keep the slur from being used by racists. In the
same way, the Anti-Defamation League owns  &UR; kike.com &LR; , as well as
other top-domain endings. That shows foresight by organizations
fighting bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a leaf from their book, political candidates this year
have been pre-empting the names of sites that might be used to
embarrass them. Though  &UR; buddhisttemple &LR;  is taken,  &UR; bobjonesu &LR; 
remains available.
</P>
<P>
   Some names are inexplicable:  &UR; Amazon.com &LR; , originally a
bookseller, has nothing directly to do with the South American
river or the legendary tribe of dominatrixes. Jeff Bezos, creator
of that successful site, named it after the river because it
carries more water than any other. (The Nile, though longer,
carries less water.)  &UR; Monster.com  &LR; is an employment finder, so
named for no reason I can ascertain other than that is the way some
people characterize bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best names are those that succinctly describe
products. For example,  &UR; johnnyglow.com  &LR; sells fluorescent adhesive
strips to put on the inside of toilet bowls to aid men who can't
find the light switch in the dark. (The slang term  &UR; john &LR;  is
applied to men's lavatories because it was once the most common
male first name. I thought I would name my Web site  &UR; tangent.com &LR; ,
but somebody with a wandering mind already did.)
</P>
<P>
   Names make not only news but also profits; and as Amelia Bloomer
and Capt. Boycott taught us, names also make words. We will watch
the coming Internet battles over trademark and copyrights in its
nomenclature, but just as important, we will keep our sticky
eyeballs on the creativity that labels the most eminent domains.
</P>
<P>
   DIPLOLINGO
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic oxymoron of the year was issued by the Egyptian
president Hosni Mubarak, attempting to put the best face on a
disappointing summit meeting between President Clinton and the
Syrian dictator Hafez Assad. ``It's a step forward,'' said Mubarak,
``although there was no progress.''

MARTINEZ JOINED GREATS WITH EPIC '99 SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ He is 28, at the top of his game, the most
valuable player in baseball. As the magnitude of his 1999 season is
finally fully absorbed, Pedro Martinez soars toward the galaxy
where Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, and Junior Griffey light the
starry night.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro is the reason Boston sports fans believe the Sox might
finally win a World Series. He is the reason baseball has reclaimed
its rightful place on the top shelf of the New England sports
cabinet. And he is the reason for our renewed interest in ace
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is coming off one of the best seasons in the history of
big league pitching. Don't ask for an instant replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one special year, and special years don't come every
year,'' he said. ``Of course, in your heart, all of the years you
get to play in the big leagues, they are special. But to have those
numbers and the type of year I had, it would be unfair to ask for
it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Pedro's pitching coach, Joe Kerrigan, ``You won't see that
for another 20-25 years. That happens once in a half-century. Some
people did comparisons in the winter and came up with a theory that
it might have been the best pitching season of the century. So
don't expect that. Our goal is for him to make all 32, 33, 34
starts. If we do that, everything else will fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro last year went 23-4 with a 2.07 earned run average and 313
strikeouts. He was the first Sox pitcher since Cy Young (1901) to
lead the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. His winning
percentage (.852) ranks third in Boston history and he fanned 10 or
more in a game 19 times. He became the first righthander to punch
out 15 or more six times since Nolan Ryan in 1974. He became the
second pitcher in history to fan 300 in each league, and his
average of 13.2 strikeouts per nine innings is the best in history.
He walked only 37 batters in 213 1/3 innings _ an all-time best
ratio of 8.46 strikeouts per 1 walk. He gave up only nine homers,
all with no one on base. He walked the leadoff hitter only six
times and only three of them scored. He fanned 37 percent of all
those who stepped in against him.
</P>
<P>
   This is to say nothing of his dramatics and clutch performances.
In July, Martinez started the All-Star Game at Fenway and put on a
show that rekindled memories of Carl Hubbell at the Polo Grounds in
1934. Hubbell struck out Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al
Simmons, and Joe Cronin in order in the first two innings. Pedro
fanned five (Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa,
and Jeff Bagwell _ four MVPs, plus McGwire) of the six batters he
faced in two innings, earning MVP honors in the American League
win. Two months later in New York, he pitched perhaps the best game
ever thrown against the mighty Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Sept. 10, Pedro toed the rubber at Yankee
Stadium and beat the world champs, 3-1, allowing only one hit and
striking out 17, including 12 of the last 15 and the last five in
order. Seventeen Yankees. All in a line. All of them good ones. He
punched out Darryl Strawberry with a 97-mile-per-hour heater in the
ninth, then fanned Chuck Knoblauch with a 96- m.p.h. fastball to
end the game. Only one of the final 15 hitters put the ball into
fair territory. Eighty-one of his 121 pitches were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   He was beating the Indians in the first game of the playoffs
when a muscle strain in his back cost the Sox the ballgame and
appeared to put them out of playoff contention. But in the fifth
and deciding game, with the score tied, 8-8, in the fourth,
Martinez came out of the bullpen to stop the bleeding. He hurled
six innings of no-hit ball, allowing only one ball out of the
infield. The Sox advanced to the American League Championship
Series and Pedro mastered Roger Clemens and the Yankees in a
memorable Game 3 at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There has never been a pitcher quite like Pedro around here. Cy
Young recorded 192 of his 511 wins with the Red Sox. Babe Ruth had
tremendous success and set a World Series record for consecutive
scoreless innings while pitching for Boston. Mel Parnell proved to
be the Sox' top lefthander, Dick Radatz was the most fearsome
reliever of all-time, Jim Lonborg dominated for one season, and
Luis Tiant was the best big-game pitcher of his generation. Then
there was Clemens, who won three Cy trophies for Boston and tied
Young with 192 career victories in a Red Sox uniform. In 1986 the
Rocket went 24-4, was the All-Star MVP and the league MVP, won the
Cy Young Award, and hurled the Sox to the seventh game of the World
Series. But Clemens '86 still falls short of Pedro '99.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Pedro so tough to hit?
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan: ``He throws 94-97 miles per hour with great control.
Then he's got the best changeup in the game. He's got the best,
violent arm action on his changeup _ the same fastball arm speed,
but it comes out 12-15 miles per hour slower with movement. Players
go up for an entire at-bat and sit on the changeup and they still
don't hit it because of the arm speed and movement. Sometimes it
will go down 8 or 10 inches. Throw in a curveball that's probably
one of the best five curveballs in the American League _ it has
great depth and buckles righthanders. He's starting to learn to use
it against lefthanders because he's more confident. So now he's a
three-pitch pitcher against both lefthanders and righthanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan claims the changeup is Martinez's best pitch. Hitters
can't detect the pitch because it's released at the same point and
Martinez's arm speed doesn't vary.
</P>
<P>
   Spring training offers a rare opportunity for major league
players. Live batting practice is the only time they get a
face-to-face view of their ace teammate at work. In mid-February,
Sox hitters Mike Stanley, John Valentin, Trot Nixon, and Troy
O'Leary experienced the unbearable heaviness of hitting against
Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   What's it like to step into the box against the Cy Young of the
new millennium?
</P>
<P>
   Stanley: ``It doesn't even help that much when he tells you
what's coming. He told me he was going to throw a curveball and I
swung at it even though it ended up outside in the dirt.
Intimidation is the best thing he's got going for him. Then
control. Then his stuff. He's the toughest pitcher I've ever
faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin: ``He's the best pitcher in the game, so sometimes it
doesn't matter if you know what's coming. Any offspeed pitch that's
thrown in a good spot is hard to hit. Pedro's command makes him
tough. He can basically throw it wherever he wants. It's a
different perspective hitting against him than watching from third
base. He throws hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon: ``I was excited to see everything he has. I feel sorry
for some of those hitters that have to face him. When he has those
A-game days, he's tough to face. He threw a lot of changeups and
fastballs to O'Leary and I. It's a nasty changeup. Even when he
tells you, it's still hard to hit because there's so much movement
on his ball.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary: ``I can't hit against Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   There.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Stewart, former ace of the A's and Blue Jays, said, ``No
doubt, he's the best in baseball, the most dominating. He and Randy
Johnson are neck and neck when it comes to that. He changes speed
and has outstanding control and a lot of movement on his ball. He
has a real good idea what he's trying to get done out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro is humble about his stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, being the No. 1 is just a matter of respect,'' he said.
``They recognize that you are the one that had the more productive
year and gives us the best chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said, ``Pedro had a premier year
in '99 _ I know, I saw every game _ but I still see him down here
this spring, trying to be better. That's his whole approach. He's
like the Yankees. All teams get up for him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was 16 years old and weighed about 137 pounds when the
Los Angeles Dodgers plucked him off the fields of the Dominican
Republic in 1988. Brother Ramon would make his major league debut
with the Dodgers two months later. The Dodgers gave Pedro English
lessons and he aced the courses. Meanwhile, he climbed the ladder
in the Dodgers system and made his big league debut in 1992. The
Dodgers used him as a long reliever because Tommy Lasorda and
others didn't think he was big enough to carry the load of a
starter. He was traded to Montreal for Delino DeShields after the
1993 season. Pedro Martinez for Delino DeShields. Straight up.
Think about that one.
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, Expos manager Felipe Alou, a fellow Dominican,
looked at Pedro's enormous hands and whippet body and saw a
starting pitcher. Perhaps Alou remembered the slight build and long
fingers of a small 1960s lefthander named Sandy Koufax. In any
event, there would be no more bullpen duty for Pedro the Younger.
In 1997 he struck out 305 batters, compiled a 1.90 ERA, and won the
Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos knew they couldn't sign him, so they put him out for
auction. Boston general manager Dan Duquette, who was in Montreal
for Pedro's formative years, knew exactly what was being made
available and offered top prospects Carl Pavano and Tony Armas Jr.
After the deal was made, the Duke went to work convincing Pedro to
sign a long-term, $75 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   It was immediately apparent that Duquette had successfully
replaced Clemens. Pedro fanned 11 A's in seven innings and beat
Oakland, 2-0, in the 1998 opener and never looked back. Martinez
went 19-7 with a 2.89 ERA in '98, then snapped Boston's 13-game
postseason losing streak when he beat the Indians in the opening
game of the Division Series. Unfortunately, he never got the ball
back, and it was on to 1999 . . . and baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has become a Boston sports cult hero, surpassing Drew Bledsoe
and any active Celtic or Bruin of your choice. Martinez is only a
couple of years and one championship removed from joining the
pantheon of Boston greats that includes Larry Bird, Bill Russell,
and Bobby Orr. He enjoys boundless popularity and seems to thrive
on the attention. He calls Fenway ``my house,'' and Pedro starts at
Fenway have become must-see events.
</P>
<P>
   Folks who split season-ticket packages now have to divvy up the
ducats so that everybody gets an equal amount of Martinez games.
Seventeen or 18 times a year, Fenway takes on a World Cup flair as
Pedro's countrymen wave Dominican flags from the bleachers and
right-field grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   The ace's enthusiasm is contagious. He encourages teammates and
fans to think positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of these days that little ground ball that went
through Bill Buckner's feet will probably be caught,'' he said. ``I
wasn't born those years they went through all those things. But I
know everything can change. When it's meant to happen, it's gonna
happen. Believe me. It's gonna happen.''
</P>
<P>
   His influence extends beyond his own performance. He keeps
teammates loose with pranks and encouragement, and Kerrigan uses
him as a teaching tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of things out of his delivery and try to carry
them over to other guys,'' said Kerrigan. ``He's great for his
teammates. They learn just by watching him. He has a domino effect
with regard to instruction with each of our pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Fort Myers looking better than ever in the spring of
2000. Sports Illustrated put him on the cover of its baseball issue
and warned the world that this will be the year the Red Sox win the
World Series. Pedro is listed as Reason No. 1.

THOUGHTS ON ARMS, FROM OLD HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some random observations on pitching aces, from those who know
them:
</P>
<P>
   --Pedro Martinez made 15 starts with an extra day's rest last
season (getting at least five days off between starts instead of
four). In those 15 starts, he went 13-0. St. Louis Cardinals
manager Tony La Russa explains the importance of giving an ace
additional time off:
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to do that a lot with Stew (Dave Stewart) and Welchie
(Bob Welch). They used to go deep into a game over and over again.
You can only go so long. It's really important to get that extra
day, because it's important to try to get to the last month of the
season and have some arm left. All of a sudden, you reach the
pressurized games in September and October and the arm's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   --Do aces have a shorter shelf life? Some studies have shown
that pitchers who log 200 or more innings, especially early in
their career, are more susceptible to injury. The Red Sox have
three other pitchers _ Ramon Martinez, Bret Saberhagen, and Jeff
Fassero _ who were all No. 1 starters on other staffs. Saberhagen
has undergone shoulder reconstruction and tore his rotator cuff
again last season, Martinez had shoulder reconstruction surgery,
and Fassero had elbow surgery. And last season, Pedro Martinez
twice went on the DL with shoulder problems.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies ace Curt Schilling, who is starting the season on the
disabled list after elbow surgery, disputes the notion that aces
are more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of the job,'' he said. ``We do stuff with our
arms that is just not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Reds pitching coach Don Gullett, who pitched for World Series
winners in Cincinnati and New York (Yankees), said he was able to
throw a 95-mile-an-hour for at least seven years before tearing his
rotator cuff. But he, too, does not believe the ace is at greater
risk than other pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all has to do with mechanics, and there's a certain amount
of luck involved,'' said Gullett. ``Guys with bad mechanics or
different types of body can't take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken an arm to a piece of machinery, a car or a lawn mower.
They only run for so long, then something is going to break. You're
lucky if you pitch 15 or 16 years. That's a freak of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   --As important as an ace is to a staff, La Russa said, it may be
more important to have depth in your rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a great No. 1 but are shaky from 2 thru 5, you're
not going to win as many games as you would with a solid 4 and 5,''
said La Russa. ``A great No. 1 is a big advantage in the
postseason. If your ace wins the first game of a short series,
that's a major advantage. Over the course of a season, I'd take a
deep rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   --A hitter's approach changes against a No. 1. Phillies batting
coach Hal McRae offers his take:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're not going to get many good pitches to hit. You
know you're probably going to get one shot at this guy. He has to
give you something, and you hope you can take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your biggest fear is you'd better get him now, because as the
game progresses he's going to get better. There's some sense of
urgency that is an advantage to the ace, because as a hitter, you
don't feel like you've got all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually think, `If our guy keeps us close, we'll get the
other guy. He'll make a mistake and we'll hit him.' But if you
don't get an ace in the first three innings, he'll kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   --Intimidation works in an ace's favor, especially when he
throws as hard as a Pedro Martinez or a Randy Johnson. But Stewart,
whose ``death stare'' was famous when he pitched for the Oakland
A's, warns not to overstate its importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's so much intimidation as just being prepared
to do what you have to do to win,'' said Stewart. ``I wish it was
as easy as putting on a face. Intimidation comes from building
success, not from putting a face on. When you start having success
and run off five, six wins in a row, all well-pitched games, you
feel better. You know you're pitching well. All of a sudden, you
build yourself a wall that people can't break.''

LEFTHANDER ANKIEL IS A RED-HOT CARDINALS PROSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; JUPITER, Fla. _ For the man with the hubcap-size biceps, his
livelihood depends in good measure on his ability to judge a
pitcher. So when strongman Mark McGwire puts his seal of approval
on 20-year-old lefthander Rick Ankiel, there should be little doubt
that the St. Louis Cardinals have a special talent in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no fear,'' McGwire said of the rookie pitcher who made
his big league debut last August, just over two years after
graduating from high school in Port St. Lucie, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good,'' McGwire said. ``He doesn't throw anything
straight. He's got pretty close to a Sandy Koufax breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a stunning comparison, given that Hall of Famer Koufax
threw one of the best curveballs ever. But it is not atypical for
Ankiel to be lavished with praise.
</P>
<P>
   He is rated the top prospect in the game by Baseball America,
which also selected him as its Minor League Player of the Year last
season, one that Ankiel began in Double A Arkansas and finished
under the Gateway Arch. His combined record in the Cardinals'
system last season was 13-3 with a 2.35 ERA. He led St. Louis minor
leaguers in wins, ERA, strikeouts (194), and strikeouts per nine
innings (12.7).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a special arm,'' said Cardinals manager Tony La
Russa. ``But one of the qualities that has impressed everybody is
that ever since he came into pro ball he's had a lot of attention,
but he just goes on the mound and competes. He puts as much
pressure on himself as anybody else, and just competes. That's
special. He has a lot of toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second game he pitched for us was an ESPN Sunday night
game against the Braves. He probably had the worst stuff and
command he had in the whole last month with us, but he gave up just
two runs in six innings. He never gave into it. He kept battling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel came into the Cardinals' camp, which is located a short
drive from where he grew up, bidding to win a spot as the fifth
starter. The Cardinals are so enamored of his potential that they
traded 18-game winner Kent Bottenfield this spring for Anaheim
center fielder Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad taught me a lot when I was young,'' said Ankiel, who in
his senior season in high school went 11-1 with an 0.47 ERA, and
struck out 162 batters in 74 innings _ better than two whiffs per
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The first time he pitched with scouts in attendance, he faced 15
batters and struck out 14 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The family has pictures of father and son playing catch when
Ankiel was 3, and his dad coached him throughout Little League.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps another measure of Ankiel's toughness that at a
time when he presumably would like to rely most on his father for
support, Richard Patrick Ankiel, 42, is going to prison. Last
September, barely a month after his son reached the big leagues,
Richard Patrick Ankiel stood before a US magistrate in West Palm
Beach, Fla., and pleaded innocent to federal charges of conspiracy
to distribute cocaine and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claimed that the elder Ankiel was part of a
drug-smuggling operation led by Richard Barker, who earned the
nickname ``Captain Jump-Off'' for smuggling illegal immigrants and
forcing them to swim to shore. The Palm Beach Post reported that
Ankiel had been arrested 14 times in a 24-year period on charges
that included burglary, carrying a concealed weapon, aggravated
assault, fleeing police, and hit and run with an injury. He had at
least six convictions.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the elder Ankiel pleaded guilty to the drug
charges, and earlier this month, while his son was fighting for a
spot on the Cardinals, he was sentenced to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Days before his father's sentencing, Ankiel stood before his
cubicle in the Cardinals' clubhouse and politely told two reporters
he had nothing to say about his father's situation and its impact
on his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even going to talk about it right now,'' said Ankiel.
``It's personal and that's where it's going to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Only grudgingly did Ankiel acknowledge that his father's
situation has been difficult for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got your personal life and you've got your business,''
he said. ``You keep them separate.''
</P>
<P>
   How hard was he finding it to do so? Ankiel, who could pass as a
lifeguard with his bleached hair, deep tan, and strapping physique
(6 feet 1 inch, 210 pounds), didn't blink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people always look at it as hard to do at a young
age?'' he said. ``I'm a person, too. I can do that. I feel like I
can. I hope I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In Double A, he made eight starts and was essentially
unhittable, going 6-0 with an 0.91 ERA and 75 strikeouts in 49 1/3
innings. He pitched 16 games for Triple A Memphis before his
promotion to the big leagues, going 7-3 with a 3.16 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 23, Ankiel pitched five innings for St. Louis in a
no-decision against the Expos. Overall, he appeared in nine games,
making five starts, and thought he had his first big league win on
the last day of the season when he pitched the last inning of a
rain-shortened game against the Cubs, only to learn that in a rain
game, the starter doesn't have to go five innings to be credited
with the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a weak way to win,'' Ankiel said, ``but
I'll take one any way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel was the first pitcher to be designated Baseball America's
Minor League Player of the Year since Tom Gordon, the injured Red
Sox closer, burst onto the scene for the Kansas City Royals in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a chance to be something special,'' said former major
league manager Jim Leyland, now a special assistant to Cardinals GM
Walt Jocketty. ``No question, he's got it all. He has a presence on
the mound. He's got stuff, poise, confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's good. It's like with Doc Gooden. When you have
stuff like that, it's easy to have presence. Confident players are
good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny that Leyland should mention Gooden, who broke into the
majors when he was 19. Gooden was then a member of the New York
Mets, who train in Ankiel's hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was little,'' Ankiel said, ``Doc Gooden was right
there. He was a young kid _ 18, 19 years old _ and just totally
dominated.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, when the Cardinals met the Astros in an
exhibition game, Ankiel pitched against his idol, and beat him,
2-1. He allowed just two hits in five scoreless innings. Houston
manager Larry Dierker offered a comparison between Ankiel and the
Doc of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that with Gooden there was a lot more swinging and
missing,'' Dierker told reporters. ``I'm not sure that with Doc, it
was necessarily how hard he threw but just the life he had on his
fastball. I would guess this guy (Ankiel) doesn't have that. But
the only reason I say that is that nobody else ever really does.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ankiel takes plenty to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a live arm, a good fastball,'' said Cardinals backup
catcher Mike Matheny. ``He's sneaky. His delivery is so smooth, it
doesn't look like he's throwing as hard as he is, but the ball gets
up and in on guys. And he's got good off-speed stuff _ curveball,
changeup, slider. He mixes it up pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's been caught up in the hype. He knows he has
the capability of being an outstanding pitcher. He has as much
potential to be as good as he wants to be. He has a lot of talent.
It's a matter of what he wants to do with it. He seems to be a hard
worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put all those variables together, it's in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's got Big Mac to back him up.

   LOS ANGELES _ What is happening to Whitney Houston? Once the
ubiquitous, uncontested queen of soulful pop, these days she is
gaining quite a reputation instead for her clamorous absences.
</P>
<P>
   She dropped out of last month's Oscars ceremony at the last
minute, supposedly with a sore throat.
</P>
<P>
   She has cancelled a duet she was due to record with George
Michael for a new album, for reasons that are far from clear.
</P>
<P>
   She has not put out a new record since 1998, and stopped her
touring schedule last year to take what her publicists are calling
``a breather.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the rumors are swirling, none of them good. Early
last week, the New York Post challenged the official version of her
withdrawal from the Oscars, reporting that she had turned up to one
rehearsal ``totally out of it,'' and that she had missed cues and
sung the wrong song at a second.
</P>
<P>
   She did not pull out of the event herself, the Post alleged, but
was sent packing by musical director Burt Bacharach.
</P>
<P>
   According to two separate accounts heard by this newspaper, the
stylists and other assistants who showed up at Houston's hotel to
take her to the Oscars rehearsals found her in a state of some
distress with the windows of her rooms blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. The May issue of Jane magazine reports that
Houston showed up four hours late for a photo shoot, claiming a
cracked tooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was extremely unfocused, had trouble keeping her eyes
open, and kept singing and playing an imaginary piano on the
table,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   In her interview with the magazine, Houston remarked that
meeting the president and meeting a junkie are ``just the same.''
``The president gets off on the country. The junkie gets off on a
couple of hits,'' she is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unfortunate use of language for a woman stopped at a
Hawaii airport in January and accused of having half an ounce of
marijuana in her bags.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is well known for her imprecise sense of timing and her
eccentric behavior. She once turned up two hours late to a White
House dinner honoring Nelson Mandela, and has been known to order
hotel staff to hose down her room with mineral water.
</P>
<P>
   Her marriage to fellow singer Bobby Brown, who has a long record
of drunk-driving convictions and arrests for assault, has also
fuelled the celebrity rumor mill. But even her admirers are now
wondering if there isn't something badly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, such speculation is still being roundly squashed. A
publicist for the Oscars, Jane LaBonte, said last week: ``I was in
the rehearsal myself the whole time, and it was really obvious the
poor lady was having a problem with her throat.'' Poor lady,
indeed. &QL;

THE FIRST NAME IN FIREBALLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Chapman had just heard, and only heard, two fastballs
whizzing by him on this overcast day, and he just plumb decided the
dugout would be a more commodious place than the batter's box, so
he placed the bat down and began walking to the Cleveland bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray!'' shouted plate umpire Billy Evans. ``You've got one
strike left!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind, Billy,'' said Chapman as he continued his little
stroll. ``I don't want it!''
</P>
<P>
   The man on the mound was Walter Johnson.

   In the 73 years since Johnson hung 'em up, we have seen many
great pitchers, from Lefty Grove to Pedro Martinez, from Dizzy Dean
to Randy Johnson. But there is no evidence that we have seen a
better pitcher than Walter Johnson. The manager has never lived who
would not be very comfortable with Johnson on the mound in any
certified Big Game.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, nicknamed ``The Big Train,'' pitched his entire career
(1907-27) for the Washington Senators. Often toiling for terrible
teams, he won 417 games (the precise total is the subject of debate
among diamond historians). He won 30 games twice and 20 games 12
times. He had a career earned run average of 2.17, 11 times having
an ERA in the 1s. He led the league in strikeouts 12 times, with a
high of 313 in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched three shutouts in four days in 1908. During the
teens, an average Johnson season was 29-15, 240 strikeouts, a 1.59
ERA, and 371 innings. In 1913, he was 36-7 with a 1.14 ERA. In 1924
and 1925, at which point he had already pitched 5,046 innings, he
submitted back-to-back 20-win campaigns. Oh, and in 1925 he also
batted .433 (42 for 97), giving new meaning to the term ``helping
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Ritter spoke to many of Johnson's contemporaries for
his epic 1966 book, ``The Glory of Their Times.'' It is clear that,
to them, Johnson was ``Half Man, Half Amazing,'' six decades before
Vince Carter was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' said Hall of Famer Wahoo Sam Crawford, ``the
greatest of them all was Walter Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   What struck Crawford, and just about everyone else, were two
things: 1. Johnson was almost exclusively a fastball pitcher. 2. He
threw with astonishing ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't have a curve,'' marveled Crawford. ``Just a fastball.
He didn't need a curve . . . He was the fastest I ever saw, by
far.''
</P>
<P>
   No curve, and no changeup of any kind, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter's idea of a changeup,'' Ty Cobb once said, ``was to
just throw harder.''
</P>
<P>
   This magnificent fastball was thrown by a man who looked as if
he were just having a catch on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever see one of those pitching machines they have?''
Crawford inquired. ``That's what Walter reminded me of, one of
those compressed-air pitching machines . . . You hardly saw the
ball at all. But you heard it. Swoosh, and it would smack into the
catcher's mitt . . . He threw so nice and easy _ then swoosh and it
was by you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that guy could fire the ball!'' declared Davy Jones, an
outfielder of those times. ``He had those long arms, absolutely the
longest arms I ever saw. They were like whips; that's what they
were. He'd just whip the ball in there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lefty Grove was fast, and Sandy Koufax was, too,'' said Jimmy
Austin, another contemporary. ``But you should have seen Walter
Johnson. On a cloudy day you couldn't see the ball half the time,
it came in so fast. That's the honest-to-goodness truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Johnson was born in Humboldt, Kan., on Nov. 6, 1887,
hence a second nickname, ``The Kansas Cyclone.'' But he was
discovered pitching in the state of Idaho by Senators catcher Cliff
Blankenship, who was sent on a scouting mission by Washington owner
Clark Griffith while nursing a broken finger. Blankenship sent back
glowing accounts, as did an anonymous source whose words still
resonate some 93 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws so fast you can't see 'em,'' said the scout, ``and
he knows where he is throwing, because if he didn't there would be
dead bodies strewn all over Idaho.''
</P>
<P>
   Major leaguers quickly learned that the best way to beat the
young rube was to bunt him silly. Batting against him was
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't long after he came to Washington that some of our
hitters, arriving in Walter's vicinity, were reporting to the sick
list,'' chuckled Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Echoed an early Cleveland newspaper account, ``Johnson's speed
was so terrific several Cleveland batters acted as though they had
no particular delight in being at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith leaned on Johnson for two decades. Said late Washington
Post legend Shirley Povich, ``Walter's drawing power and pitching
feats sustained Griffith and virtually kept big-league baseball in
Washington during the lean years. Griffith made the most of Johnson
as a gate attraction, carefully spacing the Big Train's
appearances, both home and road. Griffith would contact sports
editors the night before the game and plead over the telephone,
`Johnson's pitching tomorrow. Give me a headline.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the bunt thing worked only one time around. Cobb
reported that in his second game against the youngster he laid one
down and ``Walter bolted off the mound like a shot. It turned out
he had practiced for hours and hours.''
</P>
<P>
   His Washington teams weren't all bad. Yes, the Senators finished
last twice, seventh four times, and sixth three times during his
21-year career, but they contended strongly in 1912 and 1913 (you
think it had something to do with Walter going 69-19 those two
seasons?) and they finally won back-to-back pennants in 1924-25
(the 36- and 37-year old Walter going 43-14), and a world's
championship in 1924, Walter winning Game 7 in relief.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, it was as Bill James has said it
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his best years,'' wrote James, ``he had records as good as
anybody for teams that weren't as good as anybody's.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, therefore, that he became, along with Cobb, Babe
Ruth, Honus Wagner, and Christy Mathewson, a charter member of the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Johnson was not merely a great pitcher. He was a mythic
figure. Said Chief Meyers, who caught for the Giants in the teens,
``Everybody knew what was coming, but still couldn't hit him.
Walter's right arm was different than yours or mine. It was
special, like Caruso's lungs or Einstein's brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone out there interested in attempting to trump that?

<P>
   The fads of teen-agers can run from the ridiculous to the
absurd: leaving shoelaces untied, sucking on pacifiers, dyeing hair
five different colors, wearing pants so big they expose half the
buttocks. Parents may cringe at such weird behavior, but most
adults realize that battles over teen-agers' styles are futile, the
fads will soon fade and the damage won't be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation can be quite different when it comes to this
craze: body piercing. People, many of them fad-driven teen-agers,
boast of holes in their ears, noses, navels, nipples, eyebrows,
lips, tongues, cheeks and in some cases even their genitals.
</P>
<P>
   And some are putting their health on the line when they pierce
themselves or one another or rely on unlicensed operators who know
little about aseptic technique or the medical risks incurred when
holes are stabbed through various body parts. Even those who head
to the mall to have their ears or noses pierced by jewelry sales
clerks may be asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Many who call themselves ``piercing professionals'' have had no
formal training and may have learned the techniques from seminars,
videos or magazines, or as apprentices to other so-called
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, the decision to get pierced through, say, the
tongue or the nipple is made with little consideration of the pain
involved, the potential hazards and the long recovery time.
Fifteen-year-old David, for example, had his tongue pierced against
his father's wishes. For more than a week, he could hardly talk and
could eat little other than mush. Even when the swelling receded,
his tongue still hurt, his speech was affected, and his father
refused to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   David's warning: ``Not only make sure you have a long, hard
think about a tongue-pierce, but think of the consequences and
things that might happen afterward. When one says that the first
five or six days is close to hell, you won't fully understand it
until you get a tongue-pierce.''
</P>
<P>
   Another teen-ager who had some regrets cautioned his peers ``to
consider their career choices or college choices because of others'
reactions'' to certain piercings.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent issue of Emergency Medicine, a medical magazine, Dr.
Charles Stewart of Colorado Springs and the Dakota Heartland
Hospital in Fargo summarized the various complications that have
been known to result from body piercing.
</P>
<P>
   ALLERGY _ Most common are allergic reactions to the jewelry
inserted, especially if it is brass-plated or contains nickel. The
allergy typically results in a weeping, crusting, itchy wound. To
avoid this problem, ``body jewelry should be made of surgical-grade
stainless steel, 14-karat yellow or white gold, or titanium,''
Stewart wrote.
</P>
<P>
   INFECTION _ Almost as common and potentially far more serious
are infections, which result in redness, swelling, tenderness and
pain and often swelling of nearby glands. When sterile techniques
are not used, bacteria and viruses can be introduced into the
bloodstream, including the hepatitis B virus that can cause chronic
hepatitis and liver cancer, and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In
people born with heart valve disorders, bacterial endocarditis, a
potentially deadly infection of the heart, can result if they fail
to take preventive antibiotics. A Mayo Clinic study of 445 patients
with congenital heart disease revealed that nearly one in four
developed endocarditis after body piercing.
</P>
<P>
   Piercing the nose can result in a staphylococcal infection and
piercing the cartilaginous part of the ear, which has a very poor
blood supply, can result in a pseudomonas infection, necessitating
surgery and a resulting in permanent deformity. Even tetanus is a
risk in people who have not been immunized in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   UNSIGHTLY SCARS AND INJURY _ Some people, most commonly
African-Americans and people from Mediterranean areas, develop
large, ugly scars that may have to be surgically removed. Also, if
piercing jewelry catches on something, the tissue can be ripped.
Piercing of the tongue can result in permanent numbness, difficulty
talking, loss of taste and breathing problems if swelling is
severe. The jewelry inserted in a pierced tongue can cause teeth to
fracture or the lining of the mouth to become chronically inflamed.
</P>
<P>
   MOVEMENT OR REJECTION _ The jewelry may move or the hole become
thin and narrow, causing scarring, inflammation and prolonged
healing. Mechanical stress is a common cause, for example, when the
jewelry is under pressure or friction from clothing, or the
piercing has been placed in an area that changes shape with body
movement, or the jewelry used is too thin or too thick and heavy
for the tissue in which it is inserted.
</P>
<P>
   Start by asking friends who have been pierced about their
experiences and what they would suggest if they were to do it all
over again. Think about your future. How will adults who interview
you for school admission or jobs react when they see your
piercings? One young woman was fired from a law firm because the
rest of the staff was so repulsed by her multiple facial piercings.
</P>
<P>
   Become as well informed as possible about the procedure, its
risks and how long it is likely to take for the piercing to heal.
Are you willing to tolerate whatever pain and complications that
might ensue, regardless of how long they last? And are you willing
to adhere to postpiercing cleaning techniques for as long as they
are needed?
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Muldoon, a pediatric nurse practitioner in Bridgeport,
Conn., pointed out in the Journal of Pediatric Health Care that
``healing times vary from about eight weeks to more than a year,
depending on the site pierced.'' Throughout this time, one must
adhere to strict hygienic practices and avoid touching the hole or
the jewelry except to clean them.
</P>
<P>
   Piercing should be done only by a well-trained professional who
practices sterile techniques, wearing new disposable gloves and
using disposable tools (make sure a new package is opened in front
of you and look for brown sterile markings on the package).
Nondisposable tools must be sterilized between uses in a steam
autoclave.
</P>
<P>
   A piercing gun is safe only for piercing the ear lobe, not the
cartilaginous part of the ear or any other body part, which should
be pierced only with a proper gauge needle. Muldoon cautioned that
jewelry used in ear piercings should not be used in any other area
of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Some states require parental permission to pierce a minor. If
your parents say no, forget about it. Don't se a piercer willing
to skirt the law, and never pierce yourself or a friend. Stewart
said many operators were ``hucksters who, after attending a single
piercing seminar, set up a `studio' with the hope of making a fast
buck.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't rely on the Internet for information about piercing or
access to piercers. Stewart pointed out that much of the
information on Web sites is ``biased, erroneous or downright
misleading.''

ASK ANOTHER DOCTOR? EXPECT A CHILL IN THE EXAM ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost anyone who has ever been part of a couple has experienced
that moment of sudden disorientation when one looks at a partner
and sees only a stranger _ and an unreliable, possibly deranged
stranger at that. The thought hits: ``I must get out of this right
now before I am damaged forever,'' and life suddenly becomes more
complicated than it was an instant before.
</P>
<P>
   For romantic couples the impulse may pass, or it may escalate
into therapy, separation or divorce. The options are more limited
when the couple consists of patient and doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Some patients jarred by that sudden glimpse of Hyde across the
desk do nothing; for others (about one in five, according to a
Commonwealth Fund survey reported in the policy journal Health
Affairs last fall), the moment leads directly into the awkward and
disorienting no man's land of the second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   If medical practice were the science it is sometimes said to be,
even the word opinion would be obsolescing fast. But medical
opinions are everywhere, and second opinions are tricky business
for doctors and patients alike _ superb evidence, as if anyone
really needed it, that patients may be somewhat less empowered than
the gurus of the medical consumers movement like to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping around for a doctor is one thing, but for a patient to
ignore a familiar voice to consult a stranger still takes real
courage _ courage to head out into the unknown and also, as Dr.
Jerome Groopman points out in his new book ``Second Opinions,''
(Viking, 2000) courage to risk leaving ill will behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often a patient and his family hesitate to ask if a second
opinion would be beneficial,'' Groopman writes, ``because they fear
they will `insult' the doctor, that the question will be
misconstrued as a threat and alienate their caregiver.''
</P>
<P>
   It would a pleasure to pooh-pooh those common fears as
groundless, but actually they are not entirely off the mark.
``Alienate'' puts it a little strongly, but only doctors heading
for sainthood usually weather the experience of a long-term
patient's heading elsewhere without flinching just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how justified the doctor knows the decision may be, it
is still a poke in the viscera. Every weird harmonic overtone in
the doctor-patient relationship begins to resonate, from the
military (``I'm in charge here!'') to the professional (``I
certainly do know what I'm doing!'') to the collegial (``Anyway,
we're in this together!'') to the parental (``But you're MY
baby!'').
</P>
<P>
   Even when the second and third opinions concur entirely with the
first one, there's still something hanging in the air that wasn't
there before: not a distrust, precisely, but perhaps just a sudden
awareness of the wide windy world outside the examining room and
the fragility of the arrangement within.
</P>
<P>
   Pity your doctors for their human frailties, but be aware of
their inconsistencies, because in fact they are out getting exactly
the same second opinions on your case all the time. These opinions
simply fly by another name, that of ``consultations,'' and they are
the scaffolding on which the highly fragmented structure of medical
care rests these days.
</P>
<P>
   It is for formal consultations that I cheerfully ship patients
off to specialists, and for informal ones that I waylay colleagues
in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   When P. got that pain back in his tuberculous hip a few years
ago, I contacted every authority in the city I could think of,
friend and stranger alike, just to gather opinions of my treatment
plan. And here's the unvarnished, sorry truth: had P. been the one
who decided to make all those phone calls, I would have applauded
his industry and heeded his suggestions, but that same chilly
little wind would have blown through the examining room
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Science or no science, the balance of power is as much of a
complicated reality in medicine as it is in the marble halls of
government. And so it has always been. In fact, among the first
tasks medical ethicists took upon themselves centuries ago was to
think through the perplexing diplomatic issues posed by second
opinions and consultations.
</P>
<P>
   The British physician Sir Thomas Percival devoted large sections
of his pioneering 1803 textbook of medical ethics to the subject.
Consultations are necessary in ``difficult or protracted cases,''
Thomas wrote, and ``no important operation should be determined
upon'' without them.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew, however, that consultations could provoke serious
internecine conflict, and he devoted pages to protocols for
minimizing it: who should speak first at the meeting of doctors
(the most junior), who should actually administer treatment (the
primary physician), what to do in case of disagreement (find yet
another doctor). And, he advised, be sure never to breathe a word
about the disagreement to the patient (lest the entire medical
profession start to look foolish).
</P>
<P>
   Larger subjects compete for medical ethicists' attention these
days, and the etiquette of second opinions goes largely
unsupervised. Perhaps it is just as well that, as Groopman points
out, most medical decisions do not require them. If they did,
heaven preserve us from the tangled emotions and power struggles
that would begin to strangulate routine health care.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor in me knows that Groopman is entirely right: most
medical conditions are so clear-cut and so routine that seeking out
a second opinion is just looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the patient in me, at the moment, knows no such
thing. My left upper wisdom tooth may be just a tooth, but it is my
own, and when my dentist sympathetically announced a few weeks ago
that it was time to bid it goodbye, suddenly there was Thomas
whispering in my ear that old line of his about operations and
second opinions.
</P>
<P>
   And now I am in a sad pickle indeed. I love my dentist, my
friend for 15 years, but I also love my wisdom tooth, and I love
the second opinion that stated there seemed to be no urgent reason
for its removal. Thomas thinks I need a third dentist. I think that
what I need is simply to talk to my first one and outline in
straightforward fashion what I have done, and what the other
dentist said, and proceed from there.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that I know perfectly well that as soon as I
start to talk, a cool little wind is going to blow through the
examining room and ruffle my dentist's hair, and nothing is ever
going to be quite the same again.

ANNAN SAYS U.N. SHOULD BRING INFORMATION AGE TO POOR NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan proposed Monday
that the United Nations take the lead in bringing advanced
information technologies to poor nations, which he said could
enable them to leapfrog over traditional stages of development at a
surprisingly low cost.
</P>
<P>
   In a report designed to set the agenda for a millennium assembly
in early September to which all the world's leaders are invited,
Annan announced plans to create a new international voluntary
corps, the U.N. Information Technology Service, to train groups in
developing countries to use the Internet. He also proposed an
Internet health network for 10,000 locations in poor nations to
give hospitals and clinics access to the latest medical
information.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a major initiative to be led by the Ericsson
telecommunications company of Sweden, the world's largest producer
of mobile phones, the United Nations and the International
Committee of the Red Cross will establish a quick-response service.
The program will provide mobile and satellite phones along with
microwave links to relief workers facing natural disasters or other
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations were part of a broad report also covering
such predictable subjects as a deteriorating environment,
persistent poverty and the spread of weapons worldwide. But in
making the information proposals, Annan took another step out of
the traditional limits of U.N. action _ through member governments
and with their approval.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his backing to a leading role for private enterprise, to
the discomfort of a number of member nations that strongly oppose
growing links with both global business and nongovernmental
organizations, which often oppose government policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the heavy lifting will be done by private investment,
and partnerships with philanthropic foundations will also be very
important,'' Annan said of his partners in the proposal, which he
suggested would make the United Nations more relevant to a new age.
``Probably the best ideas will come from outside government.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general had a warning for governments that try to
block or roll back the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are depriving their nations, their people of great
opportunity by trying to limit access to these technologies _ and
besides, they are going to fail, so they shouldn't waste resources
trying to block it,'' Annan said at a news conference after
presenting his report to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it is frightening for those who want to control
everything, for those who would want to control information in
their society and what happens in their country,'' he said. ``But
it's simply not going to be possible. I would urge them to be
forward-looking for the sake of their people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a world where more than a fifth of the population exists on a
dollar a day or less and foreign aid has dropped, information
technology may be a cost-cutting device rather than an
extravagance, Annan said at his news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be used without having vast amounts of hardware or
financial capital,'' he said. ``What you need above all is brains,
which are the one common commodity equally distributed among the
world's peoples. So for a relatively little investment _ in
education, for example _ we can bring all kinds of information in
reach of poor people, enabling poor countries to leapfrog some of
the long and painful stages of development that others have had to
go through.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the assembly, Annan acknowledged that there has
been a backlash against globalization, with its effects seen as
negative or even threatening. He mentioned concerns over
biotechnology's inroads in food production and announced that he
would set up a network for discussing the issue and allaying fears
``so that the poor and hungry do not lose out.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters later, Annan said that his report
``contains some pretty alarming facts, particularly in the chapter
on environment, and some pretty shaming ones regarding poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted in his speech that in the last decade, civil wars have
killed 5 million people and driven many times that number from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Annan described his report as ``a comprehensive account of the
challenges facing humanity as we enter the 21st century, combined
with a plan of action for dealing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That may seem absurdly ambitious,'' he said. ``But if the
United Nations does not attempt to chart a course for the world's
peoples in the first decades of the new millennium, who will?''

   Now that we know the earth is as round as Michael Clark Duncan's
head, and Christopher Columbus has his own holiday, we don't have
much patience for flat. And so goes Mob TV after ``The Sopranos,''
now that we've taken David Chase's trip through the
multi-dimensional world of New Jersey's &UR;  &LR; made men and their
blood-stained car trunks. Who has time for a capo without a shrink?
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone,'' a new series premiering Tuesday, is actually better
than flat, but only by a degree or two. It's based on the exploits
of real-life undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone, a family man who
submerged himself in the New York mob. The story made an excellent
movie, ``Donnie Brasco,'' and it's a rich premise for a TV series,
as a moral man gets blood on his hands and neglects his family in
the name of a greater good. Is he a hero, or a workaholic? Is he
secretly turned on by the criminal world he's infiltrating? And
will the mean boys with the guns ever discover his true identity?
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone,'' named after Joe's mob alias, skips in and out of
these questions, and it's a fun ride at first. The series is
tightly plotted, and the twists create moments of satisfying
intrigue, particularly when members of the Volonte family nearly
find out Joe's masquerade. But juicy plot turns alone cannot fuel a
series for long, especially when they repeat themselves, and the
limitations of ``Falcone'' become clearer in its second and third
episodes. Soon you realize that the mob will almost catch Joe in
every episode, and that Joe's wife may never do more than throw
worried looks at the camera again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems: The script is laden with overfamiliar
gangster-crew lingo that becomes tiresome. The noir look, now
predictible in TV crime dramas, is not artfully done. And the
casting is significantly off base. Pistone, played by Johnny Depp
in ``Donnie Brasco,'' is given an overly sensitive spin by Jason
Gedrick, the hunky actor recently seen cleaning Ally McBeal's
exhaust pipe in a car wash. Gedrick, also known from ``Murder One''
and ``EZ Streets,'' is likable, and he could easily carry a series,
but he's too likable in ``Falcone'' to be believable. What
self-respecting mobster would let this softy in on all his evil
plans?
</P>
<P>
   As ladder-climbing mob captain Sonny Napoli, Titus Welliver is
more effective, especially as the series progresses and we see his
cool crumble in explosions of rage. Along with his unusual name,
Welliver has a curiously compelling face, and his hard eyes seem to
whisper evil. On the other hand, his crew members aren't
distinctive, although ``Sopranos'' fans will recognize Lillo
Brancato Jr., who played the idiotic wannabe recently whacked by
Pussy and Tony. Only a raving Eric Roberts, who plays the mob boss
living in a psychiatric hospital, brings true electricity to the
proceedings, but he appears but a handful of times in the first
four episodes. He also adds a blackly comic element sorely missing
elsewhere on the show.
</P>
<P>
   In a risky move, CBS is airing the series as if it were a
miniseries event. Following the two-hour premiere, it will air in
nightly hourlong installments at 10 p.m. through April 12, skipping
only Sunday. The importance of that last date? It's the season
finale of ``The Sopranos.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The two-hour daily commute from Westport, Conn., to
Manhattan gives Maggie Kneip, a children's publishing executive for
Scholastic, plenty of time to catch up on work, but little chance
for exercise. Frustrated and energy-deprived, Kneip, 44, hoisted
her briefcase and raced the 10 flights of stairs to her office one
morning last year and has rarely hopped the elevator since.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past two years, my only workout was running for the
train,'' said Kneip. ``Sprinting the 10 floors is quick and
intense, although I'm so winded at the top, I have to assure my
co-workers I'm not going to faint.''
</P>
<P>
   Climbing to the top in the urban rat race is taking on new
meaning for many overworked professionals who, surrounded by
skyscrapers, are incorporating stair running into their busy
schedules as a convenient and effective workout.
</P>
<P>
   Every Tuesday afternoon, Jerry Silk, 30, a securities lawyer,
changes from business suit to sweats and meets one of the partners
of his midtown law firm in the stairwell of the Paine Webber
building. For the next half hour, the two race from their 33rd
floor office to the top, about 30 flights, and back down again to
lower and lower floors until they reach the point of exhaustion.
Silk estimates they run 80 flights on average and he still feels
the burn in his legs two days later. Workout complete, they shower
at the office and return to work.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the physical and psychological challenge is valuable
preparation for the corporate grind. Dino Bradlee, 41, a vice
president for the Trump Organization, views his 10-minute vertical
workout at his Manhattan apartment building each morning as an
advantage at the office. ``You need every edge you can get,''
Bradlee said. ``Climbing the stairs puts you physically and
mentally at the top of your game. And once you've done it, the rest
of the day is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The workout itself is not. Unlike using a step machine at the
health club, running a stairway pits gravity and the body's own
resistance against the runner, making for a grueling workout that
keeps the heart rate high and develops endurance, strength and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Radu, a fitness trainer who uses the stairwell in
his gym on West 57th Street to incorporate stair running into his
program, a kind of chain reaction is triggered between the muscles,
from the legs through the lower back and even into the upper body
as arms pump and sometimes pull on the banisters. Because there are
often 10 clients at a time running the stairs in Radu's class, the
workouts become competitive. ``The group energy will lift you,
encouraging you to push yourself further,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Plemich, 43, a customer representative in Westchester,
Ill., for PeopleSoft, a business software company, is captain of
her company's seven-member stair running team. Year round, the
group trains together in its 10-story office building after work.
``It's obviously convenient and most of us are training for
marathons and triathlons anyway, so we work together,'' Plemich
said. The group recently competed in the Hustle Up the Hancock, an
annual race up the John Hancock building in Chicago to benefit the
American Lung Association.
</P>
<P>
   The routines vary. Bradlee sprints at full tilt for 10 minutes
and returns to his apartment in ``a heap.'' Linda Modico, a
37-year-old money manager in Manhattan, can spend 20 to 30 minutes
on a workout. It includes a single-step jog from the 33rd floor to
20th floor, then a return to the 33rd in the same pattern. Next,
she goes two steps at a time from 33 to 20 and back up at a skip.
Sometimes she'll jump with both legs or lunge-walk two or three
steps at a time, repeating these sequences up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Given the arduous nature of the sport, fitness experts caution
that the standard warnings given people starting a new exercise
program are especially important. As tempting as the skyscrapers
may be to potential climbers, most city buildings do not allow
general access to stairwells for safety and security reasons, other
than the occasional stair climbing races like the Hancock race and
the Empire State Building Run Up. But many of the smaller office
buildings and larger apartment buildings do allow access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stairway in our building is just begging to be used,''
says Kneip.
</P>
<P>
   For others like Modico, who races through the stairwell of her
downtown high-rise apartment nearly every morning, the exercise is
a little more private. ``I'm sure I'm the only one here doing
this,'' she said. &QL;

because it is _ the '80s TV drama ``Wiseguy'' and the 1997 movie
``Donnie Brasco'' played this tune first. So how does ``Falcone''

&HT;     TABLOID MAKING HEADLINES IN PHILLY SEEKS OUTLET IN SAN
FRANCISCO

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A free tabloid newspaper being distributed on
Philadelphia's buses and subways may make its next stop on the San
Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system.
</P>
<P>
   A legal war is going on in Philadelphia over the Swedish-owned
Metro, which has started free, commuter-friendly newspapers in
Zurich, Prague, Helsinki, as well as Santiago, Chile. The first
North American version of the newspaper began two months ago in
Philadelphia, infuriating some in the mainstream journalism world.
</P>
<P>
   Most stories in the Metro are only three paragraphs long, but
Philadelphia's two daily newspapers object to the deal because they
say a government agency putting out a newspaper creates the
potential for a conflict of interest. Also, Metro is allowed to
distribute 150,000 newspapers on buses and in subway stations,
which is off-limits to the Inquirer and Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Metro International has been courting transit agencies in San
Francisco, Chicago, Boston and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Chicago and Boston have said no thanks. The Municipal
Railway in San Francisco said it had other priorities. But BART
officials say they may bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've expressed interest and we're interested in their
proposal,'' said BART spokesman Mike Healy. ``But I'm not aware of
anything concrete happening at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be because Metro International is locked in a legal
battle over distribution with the Philadelphia Inquirer and
Philadelphia Daily News, both owned by the Knight-Ridder newspaper
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's transit agency gets paid for the exclusive
distribution rights of the 24-page daily, which mostly runs brief
news, sports and entertainment stories.
</P>
<P>
   What troubles newspapers such as USA Today, the Philadelphia
dailies, the New York Times and Boston Globe, which are all suing,
is the dangerous precedent of government getting involved in the
world of publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month rejected the
plaintiffs' request for an injunction to block distribution of the
Metro, but has not yet formally heard the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, known as
SEPTA, gets $30,000 per month in advertising revenue and one page
in each issue to write its own stories in exchange for distribution
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transit agency here is a government agency staffed by
political appointees. It just seems philosophically wrong for them
to be putting out a newspaper,'' said Zack Stalberg, editor of the
Philadelphia Daily News, a tabloid that gets most of its readers
through rack sales.
</P>
<P>
   He is especially galled because he said SEPTA has control in the
five-year contract over editorial content, even though the agency
filed a court affidavit saying it had no intent to interfere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they do or don't'' exercise control, Stalberg said,
``it seems like a bad precedent. The next thing you know the City
Council will be putting out its own paper and then the mayor.
They're pretending to be a newspaper when they're published by the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Stalberg also claims that the newspaper has conveniently ignored
several stories the mainstream newspapers have written about the
transit agency.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roberts, a former Daily News city editor and current boss
at Metro, said that while it is not stated in the contract that
SEPTA will keep hands off the content, they promised to essentially
do that in a court affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aggressively nonpartisan and independent,'' he said,
noting that the newspaper does not have an editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were a scandal at the agency, would his
publication report it? ``Absolutely,'' said Roberts, noting that
the newspaper ran a story on the agency's loss of a $50 million
lawsuit over a boy who lost his foot in a SEPTA accident.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts indicated he thinks the issue revolves more around
professional jealousy and newspapers that want to protect their
share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts also argued that the Daily News wanted the bus drivers
to sell the newspapers on board.
</P>
<P>
   Whether BART decides to distribute the publication is still
undecided, although the San Francisco area transit agency said a
deal with the Metro could mean revenue of $1 million per year.
Healy hinted that the agency probably would not want to get into an
agreement while a lawsuit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' he said. ``I don't think we would
enter into anything that would give us exposure.''

   Butterfly's Light Show
</P>
<P>
   All those Jumbotrons, Nasdaq-o-ramas and other giant TV screens
in Times Square have one thing in common. They use combinations of
just three colors _ blue, green and red, usually produced by
light-emitting diodes _ to create the infinite palette that humans
perceive.
</P>
<P>
   While it cannot display stock quotes, a male Indonesian
butterfly uses much the same principle to produce the spectacular
green color of its wings. It does not employ diodes, of course, but
there is no pigment to speak of either. The color is the result of
differing reflections of light.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Exeter in England, studying the
wing surface in detail, have found that it is covered in millions
of pits, each less than five microns wide, like some vast
microscopic muffin tin. The pits are made up of a multilayered
material that is iridescent; that is, it reflects light at
different colors depending upon the angle at which the light hits
it.
</P>
<P>
   Light hitting the flat bottoms of the pits is reflected back as
yellow. But light hitting the sloping sides is reflected as blue,
because it hits at a shallower angle. Ordinarily, this blue light
would not be reflected back to the observer.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the researchers report in the journal Nature,
the angles are such that the light bounces off one side to the
opposite side, where it is reflected back toward the source. These
reflections are so tiny that the human eye cannot distinguish them;
instead they mix to create green.
</P>
<P>
   Return to the Wild
</P>
<P>
   One of the original group of 27 California condors that were
captured in the mid-1980s as part of an effort to save the birds
from extinction will be released back to the wild Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The condor, the last female caught among the original group and
the first to be sent back, will be released in her native habitat,
the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in the Los Padres National Forest, about
30 miles east of Santa Barbara. She will be a ``mentor'' to two
10-month-old condors hatched in captivity and being released at the
same time. Among other things, she is expected to teach the younger
birds about where to find sites for roosting and foraging.
</P>
<P>
   The bird had been at the San Diego Zoo, part of the California
Condor Recovery Project, which was initiated in the mid-1970s and
has seen the condor population swell to 155, including 56 that have
been released into the wild. The bird, known as AC-8, had nine
offspring, but is now believed to be beyond breeding age.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the project expect that AC-8 will have little
trouble readjusting to the wild, even after 14 years. She has spent
the past several months in a flight pen at the Los Angeles Zoo,
preparing for her re-entry.

   SIDE EFFECTS: Of Pills, Pressure and Diabetes Risk
</P>
<P>
   A new study has found that one important class of high blood
pressure medication, thiazide diuretics, does not increase the risk
of diabetes, as had previously been suspected. In fact, patients
taking these drugs developed fewer cases of diabetes than people
not taking them.
</P>
<P>
   One other class of hypertension medications, beta blockers, was
found to increase diabetes risk by 28 percent. But the authors of
the study, published last week in The New England Journal of
Medicine, said that result by itself should not frighten patients
away from beta blockers, which for many people are the most
effective medicine with the fewest side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not suggesting that doctors stop prescribing beta
blockers, as they have proven benefits in lowering the risk of
cardiac events,'' said Dr. Frederick L. Brancati, a professor of
medicine and cardiology at Johns Hopkins University. ``But
physicians need to weigh the benefits against the diabetes risk and
monitor patients carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The study drew its conclusions by comparing the results of
detailed physical examinations collected over six years on 12,550
middle-aged adults with heart disease or significant risk factors.
The study also found no increased risk of diabetes for patients
taking blood pressure medicines known as ACE inhibitors or calcium
channel blockers.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: Boys' Heights Linked to Failing Grades
</P>
<P>
   Boys who are shorter are more likely to be held back in school,
a study from Australia suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published March 29 in The Archives of Disease in
Childhood, researchers from the University of Melbourne compared
the heights of 2,848 students ages 5 to 12 from 24 schools.
</P>
<P>
   They found that at every grade, the oldest third of the students
were the shortest _ and that the difference was accounted for
almost entirely by the 133 children who had been held back a grade,
two-thirds of whom were boys.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggested that height as a sign of maturity or
lack of it might tip the balance in some decisions on whether to
hold back a struggling student. Some evidence suggests that adults
tend to treat children at a level appropriate to size, rather than
age, the article concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Melissa Wake, a pediatrician who was the study's lead
author, said that she often heard parents raise the issue of size
while wrestling with the difficult question of whether to hold
their child back a grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, `He's really big, he'll stand out from the
younger kids,' or `He's really little, he'll fit in,''' she said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main advice I would give parents is to focus on the
child's educational needs, but to be aware that height might be
playing a role in their or their school's decision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AT RISK: Surgery, Under the Influence of Herbs
</P>
<P>
   Half of the surgical patients surveyed in a University of
Colorado study used herbal or alternative medicines or vitamins in
the days before their operations, although many of these substances
could have interfered with their anesthetics, prolonged bleeding or
affected blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, published February in The American Association of
Nurse Anesthetists Journal, found that 51 percent of 500 patients
took one of these substances in the two weeks before surgery _ the
period of abstention recommended by the American Society of
Anesthesiologists. Twenty-four percent took more than one.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven percent took substances _ including garlic, ginko,
kava, vitamin E, fish oil and some Chinese herbs _ that could have
interfered with coagulation, the study found. Twelve percent
reported taking substances known to affect blood pressure, like
black cohosh and St. John's wort, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine percent took herbs, like kava or valerian, that could have
increased the sedating effect of anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   The study's author, Carol Norred, a nurse who is a doctoral
student at the University of Colorado Health Science Center's
Department of Anesthesiology in Denver, noted that earlier surveys
had found that 70 percent of people who took alternative medicines
never told their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can compromise a patient's safety if these medicines
aggravate a health condition or interact poorly with the drugs used
during surgery,'' Norred said.
</P>
<P>
   MUSCLE GROUPS: With Massage, Relief but No Renewal
</P>
<P>
   Massage may make tired athletes feel better, but it does not
appear to help &QC; the muscles recover from exertion any faster, a
study published last week in The British Journal of Sports Medicine
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the Division of Sports Studies at the
University College Northampton enlisted eight amateur boxers to put
massage to the test.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-minute workout, in which an average of 400 punches
were thrown, half the boxers were given 20-minute massages and half
just rested for the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Before they got back in the ring for a second workout, blood
samples were taken and lactate levels were compared. Lactate,
produced as a byproduct of exertion, can hinder muscle function.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of massage suggest that it increases blood flow and
thereby speeds up the process of flushing lactate out of tired
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, however, showed no difference in lactate levels, and
both groups saw their punching power fall by similar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the boxers who got the massages did report feeling much
better than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   SAFETY: Thinking _ A Behind-the-Wheel Hazard
</P>
<P>
   Thinking while driving can be dangerous, but mental tasks that
involve spatial calculations seem to distract drivers more than
verbal problems, a new study from Spain concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Safety officials know that distraction is a serious hazard on
the road, but have little data so far about what kinds of mental
activity are more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   In research conducted in and around Madrid, drivers were sent
out on highways and two-lane roads in a Citroen Bx-GTI equipped to
record their eye movements.
</P>
<P>
   As they drove, they were asked to &QC; repeat words starting with a
certain letter, or to visualize the letters of the alphabet,
categorizing them as ``open'' or ``closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Luis Nunes, a government psychologist who was a co-author of
the paper, said in an e-mail interview that most of the drivers
considered the spatial task easier than the verbal one, but that in
fact the visual work interfered with driving to a far greater
degree.
</P>
<P>
   During the spatial-imagery tasks, drivers fixed their eyes on
certain points longer and glanced less often at their mirrors or
dashboards, according to the study published last week in The
Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied. ``It seems that during
the visual tasks, a person's eye freezes up,'' said Nunes'
co-author, Dr. Miguel Recarte, a psychologist at Complutense
University in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Nunes said in the e-mail message that they were not advocating
``extreme isolation'' of the driver. Some secondary activities,
like listening to music, have been found to enhance concentration,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you find yourself thinking about a problem that needs a
lot of attention,'' he advised, ``simply leave it for later _ or
you can have a more serious problem because of an accident.''

   BOSNIA-WARCRIMES (The Hague, Netherlands) _ U.N. prosecutors
rejoiced as the most senior war crimes suspect to date was arrested
Tuesday in Bosnia and brought for trial, galvanizing their crusade
to bring the architects of the Balkan ``ethnic cleansing''
campaigns to justice. Momcilo Krajisnik, a close ally of former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, was arrested at his home in
Pale by French NATO troops who witnesses said forced open the door

   Alcohol and Heat
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why does drinking alcohol give the illusion of warmth without
keeping you warm in cold weather?
</P>
<P>
   A. The assumptions of the question are not totally true, said
Dr. Samir Zakhari, a pharmacologist who is director of the division
of basic research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just drinking but where you drink and what kind of
clothes you have on'' that determine whether the body ends up
warmer or colder, Zakhari explained.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, he said, is that alcohol causes the blood vessels
in the skin to dilate, so that more blood passes through, and more
blood means more heat going through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you drink and are sitting in the living room with a
sweater on, that heat due to vasodilation will be retained, and you
will feel warm,'' Zakhari said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you go outside without enough clothing, all that heat
will dissipate, so that the body loses heat,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Such heat loss poses a serious risk of death from hypothermia
for people drinking outside in cold weather, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive drinking also impairs sensation and the judgment that
would ordinarily tell a person that it is time to come in from the
cold.

   To a boater drifting in the open ocean on a calm day, the seas
seem to stretch uniformly from horizon to horizon, one level
expanse of water gently rolling with a calming oscillation.
</P>
<P>
   But the oceans, even when unjostled by wind and waves, are
hardly perfectly level from one place to another. The height of an
undisturbed sea's surface can differ from a few inches to several
feet from place to place depending upon what lies far beneath the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have learned to exploit this phenomenon from above to
map mountains, valleys, trenches and other features on the ocean
floor that have gone virtually unvisited by humans and their
devices.
</P>
<P>
   This information, coupled with data from submarine exploration,
sonar scans and instruments lowered to the depths, has now produced
the most comprehensive, detailed maps of sea-floor topography
released to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The undersea renderings are part of a new set of color,
computer-generated relief maps depicting the textured surface and
seabeds of the earth on a scale not previously available. The new
set is six times as detailed as a 1991 version.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen new views of the earth are included in the images
released last month by the National Geophysical Data Center in
Boulder, Colo., part of the Commerce Department's National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration. The center gathers and exchanges
geophysical and geological information with international
organizations, academic researchers, government agencies, the
military and other sources. It compiles the information into
computerized databases used by its scientists to create maps and
other images.
</P>
<P>
   The maps, which depict the earth as seen from space with no
covering clouds, provide shaded, three-dimensional views of the
geophysical variations that give the planet its unique look.
Continental uplifts with their mountain ranges, plains and
depressions contrast with deep ocean basins fractured by shifting
tectonic plates and massive crustal upswellings. Some of the images
even show the location of fault lines that produce earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter W. Sloss of the data center said the detail of the
undersea topography maps was the biggest change from earlier
versions. This time, researchers were able to include sea-surface
data gathered in the late 1970s by satellites that scanned the
oceans with radar.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing sea heights measured by radar with models of where
the surface ought to be if undisturbed by gravitational variations
underneath, Sloss said, researchers can infer what the ocean floor
looks like by the subtle changes it produces higher up. Computers
are programmed to filter out waves and other short-term
disturbances that influence sea-surface heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sea mountain, for instance, attracts water toward it because
its mass produces gravity that pulls down in all directions, from
its top all the way down its sides,'' he said, ``The object below
actually creates a hump over itself that roughly suggests its
shape. The same is true of a trench, which we can see as a subtle
trough on the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloss said the satellite data was calibrated at certain points
by physical depth measurements to confirm that it could be used
accurately to interpret the nature of the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   Set of images and forms for ordering copies are available at the
data center's Web site, www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/whatsnew.html.

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR CASE ON LIMITS ON LEGAL AID TO POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The highly charged question of what strings the
government can attach to the use of federal money reached the
Supreme Court again Monday, this time in the context of legal
services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to decide whether Congress had violated the
First Amendment when it restricted the type of arguments that
lawyers supported by the Legal Services Corp. can make on behalf of
clients seeking welfare benefits. Under the restriction, the
lawyers can help clients who are seeking to receive or restore
specific welfare benefits, but may not become involved in ``an
effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in New York ruled last year that
because the provision, first imposed on the agency in 1996,
``clearly seeks to discourage challenges to the status quo,'' it
amounted to ``viewpoint discrimination'' that the First Amendment
made impermissible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest protection of the First Amendment's free speech
guarantee goes to the right to criticize government or advocate
change in government policy,'' Judge Pierre N. Leval said in his
majority opinion for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, adding
that criticism of the government ``is also speech for which liberty
must be preserved to guarantee freedom of political choice to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration appealed to the Supreme Court,
arguing that the restriction posed no constitutional problem
because Congress ``has simply chosen to pay for certain services
but not others.'' The administration said it was clear from Supreme
Court precedents that the government could incorporate such a
preference for the use of its money into federal law or
regulations. The case the administration cited was a 1991 decision,
Rust vs. Sullivan, which upheld a prohibition on counseling about
abortion in family planning clinics that received federal money.

ZEBRA MUSSELS STAR IN HUDSON'S ECOLOGICAL MELODRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silently, mostly out of sight and unknown to all but a handful
of the millions of people who live along the Hudson River, a subtle
but elegant ecological drama is under way that may determine
whether the revivified, revitalized river can continue its hard-won
recovery from decades of pollution and degradation.
</P>
<P>
   The central player in the drama is the zebra mussel, a
coin-size, hard-shelled, black-and-white-striped mollusk from
Eurasia that hitchhiked to the Great Lakes aboard oceangoing ships
in the late 1980s and has since been on the march in waters of the
northeastern United States. The mussels first appeared in the
Hudson a decade ago; their fluctuating population there is
estimated at 500 billion to 600 billion in peak years.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, attention has focused on the mussel's ability to
disrupt water supplies by clogging intake pipes. But its ecological
impact is perhaps more spectacular; it has simply transformed the
chemistry of the freshwater portion of the Hudson, roughly above
West Point, and threatened the stability of that entire stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for some time, for instance, that the
heaviest concentrations of mussels filter all the water in their
part of the river through their bodies every three days, as
compared, in their absence, with every 50 days for all other
aquatic organisms combined. In doing so, the mussels strain out and
consume microscopic plants, called phytoplankton, that are the
basis of the aquatic food chain.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been that numbers of tiny aquatic animals that
feed on the phytoplankton were cut about in half, sharply reducing
food supplies for creatures higher on the chain. Another is that
freshwater clams, which also consume phytoplankton, declined
drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Now experts have discovered another serious threat posed by the
mussels. They suck up so much oxygen from the water that in summer,
much of the ecosystem is approaching a danger point at which other
aquatic creatures begin to flee or die, according to a new study by
a team of ecologists at the Institute for Ecosystem Studies in
Millbrook, N.Y., who have been studying the Hudson ecosystem since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   The report of the discovery, by Dr. Nina F. Caraco and six
colleagues at the institute, appears in the April 1 issue of
Environmental Science and Technology, a publication of the American
Chemical Society. Their study was based on detailed measurements of
dissolved oxygen in the river and an analysis of differences in
oxygen concentrations before and after the mussels appeared.
</P>
<P>
   There is some irony in the discovery, since oxygenless dead
spots that once plagued the river as a result of an influx of raw
sewage have been eliminated over the last three decades at the cost
of several billion dollars' worth of sewage treatment systems.
Bacteria consume oxygen as they decompose sewage and other organic
matter.
</P>
<P>
   For the bacteria to match the mussels' depletion of oxygen,
Caraco said, ``you would have to increase present sewage in the
river threefold.'' The oxygen loss caused by the mussels would be
twice as bad as it is except for another aspect of their impact,
she said, and it is here that the ecological plot thickens.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, Caraco said, that the mussels also remove from the
river many small particles that cloud the water and reduce the
penetration of sunlight. With more sunlight flooding the clearer
water, slender, underwater native plants called water celery have
flourished. The plants give off oxygen as they convert sunlight to
energy through photosynthesis, and this extra oxygen has partly
offset the loss of it to mussels.
</P>
<P>
   But another actor now enters, altering the equation yet again.
It is a second exotic invader called the water chestnut, a floating
plant that produces spiny seed pods that can pierce a rubber sole
and grows so densely that some boats cannot go through it.
</P>
<P>
   Like all aquatic plants, Caraco said, the fast-spreading
chestnuts draw oxygen from the river as part of their metabolism;
but unlike the water celery, none of the oxygen they give off in
photosynthesis returns to the water; instead, it is vented to the
air. The result is that the water in many chestnut beds has no
oxygen at all in the summer _ when higher temperatures accelerate
organisms' activity _ and tidal mixing distributes some of this
water to other parts of the river.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Hudson has had a startling recovery since the
days in the 1960s when it was a foul stream polluted by the raw
sewage of cities and towns up and down its length. Some parts were
literally dead in the summer from lack of oxygen. Today, as a
result of deliberate cleanup efforts, industrial decline and the
recapture of onetime farmland by resurgent forests that reduce the
runoff of sediments, the river bursts with life. More than 200
species of fish live in or visit it, and the water is clean enough
in many places to swim in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its resurgent vitality, though, the Hudson is in many
ways no longer natural but rather a human artifact. People control
and alter its shape, the flow of nutrients that sustain it, the
character of its habitats _ and the mixture of species that live in
it. At least scores and probably hundreds of species from other
lands and other parts of the continent inhabit the river and its
immediate environs. About 10 percent of these, according to earlier
research, have had an ecological impact, most of it negative.
</P>
<P>
   The zebra mussels are Exhibit A. At peak densities, they
outweigh all other organisms in their territory combined. The
territory stretches from the dam at Troy to the fringes of the New
York metropolitan area, where the water becomes too salty for them.
</P>
<P>
   They are especially concentrated in the upper stretches, where
the rocky bottom is to their liking and they cluster in densities
estimated at 10,000 to 20,000 individuals per square meter (about
10 square feet). Even in the lower, softer-bottomed stretches, they
may account for a third to a half of all organisms by weight, said
Dr. David L. Strayer of the Millbrook institute, one of Caraco's
co-authors.
</P>
<P>
   In a stroke of bad ecological luck, Strayer said, the highest
concentrations of mussels happen to be where the Hudson's
phytoplankton production is also concentrated. ``That's one of the
reasons the ecological impacts are so severe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems likely that the mussels' drain on oxygen will
probably not get much worse than it already is, he said, the spread
of the water chestnut could combine with the mussels' oxygen use to
worsen it. Even if this never gets to the point where extensive
fish kills result, he said, it could well place a cap on further
efforts to enhance the river's health.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, areas dominated by the water chestnut are
already devoid of summertime oxygen, and this limits habitat for
native species, hobbling habitat restoration efforts and shrinking
rather than expanding the ranges of many aquatic creatures.
Expansion of the water chestnut could shrink the available habitat
even more.
</P>
<P>
   It is, Strayer said, as if the mussels and the chestnut are
limiting opportunities for further improvement of the Hudson.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After having a biopsy taken of a suspicious lump, a patient
usually puts his fate in the hands of a person he has never met: a
pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   Off in a lab somewhere, the pathologist decides whether a sliver
of tissue is benign or malignant, and if cancerous, how aggressive
the disease is, decisions that are pivotal to the treatment. But
most people don't know anything about the pathologist, don't ask
for his credentials or those of the laboratory, or ask for a second
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   For most patients, this hands-off approach works well. But
according to a study that reviewed the biopsy slides of 6,171
patients referred to Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions for cancer
treatments, 86 patients had diagnoses that were significantly wrong
and would have led to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of error was 1.4 percent, which is low, but not
insignificant. At Johns Hopkins alone, it would be equal to about
one cancer patient a week with a wrong diagnosis, and across the
country could add up to a conservative estimate of 30,000 mistakes
a year.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 patients, a second opinion changed a malignant diagnosis
to a benign one. In five other cases, a growth reported to be
benign was later found to be malignant, and in six cases one type
of cancer had been mistaken for a different type. These results,
published in December in the journal Cancer, are consistent with
previous studies.
</P>
<P>
   Some types of cancer, though, like ovarian, cervical, skin or
lymphatic, are more difficult to diagnose and are somewhat more
prone to errors. In an earlier study at Johns Hopkins, a review of
the slides of cancer patients referred for prostate surgery found
major errors in 6 of 535 men, sparing them from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 study at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center in Dallas, a review of ovarian, uterine, cervical and vulvar
biopsies found major errors in 2 percent of the cases, leading
doctors to cancel six operations and five chemotherapy treatments.
And a 1997 review of patients who went to the University of Texas
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for second opinions of their brain and
spinal cord biopsies found major errors in 8.8 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did not include more minor errors in rating how
fast-growing and how advanced a cancer was. These so-called grading
and staging errors are more common and can affect how aggressively
a patient is treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to send a panic among everybody that their
biopsies are wrong,'' said Dr. Jonathan I. Epstein, the study's
lead author and professor of pathology, urology and oncology at
Johns Hopkins. In fact, the majority of people who have been told
they have cancer do indeed have it and are getting the correct
treatment, he said. ``But,'' he added, ``there's a sizable
minority, maybe 2 to 3 percent, who have a wrong diagnosis or who
could have a more accurate diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically once a biopsy is taken, the specimen is sent to a
commercial laboratory or a hospital's in-house laboratory. Though
there is a general perception that pathology is an exact science _
that a cell is either malignant or not _ the differences between
malignant and benign can be subtle, and interpretations can be
subjective. In some cases, spotting a malignancy is easy, but in
others, the clues that tell a pathologist a cell is cancerous are
well concealed.
</P>
<P>
   Experts attribute the majority of the errors to the many benign
mimickers of cancer and the reverse: malignancies that mimic benign
processes. One patient at Johns Hopkins received a diagnosis of
skin cancer of the ear and was told that a section of the middle
ear had to be removed. The pathologist who reviewed the slide found
that it was a simple fungus infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pathologists who have a lot of experience can recognize the
mimickers, whereas a pathologist who's not as experienced may
confuse the two and make a misdiagnosis of cancer,'' Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The pathologist's job is only getting more difficult as doctors
move toward less invasive procedures that are designed to disturb
the body as little as possible. Using needles to remove samples
from the prostate and breast, for instance, surgeons are eking out
the smallest possible amount of tissue, often no thicker than the
nib of a pen, giving pathologists much less to examine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on seeing how the abnormal cells differ in their
growth and appearance from normal cells,'' said Dr. John E.
Tomaszewski, director of surgical pathology at the University of
Pennsylvania Medical Center. ``That may get lost if you have a very
small piece of tissue. What was an easy diagnosis of a large piece
of tissue becomes a very difficult diagnosis on a small piece of
tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as the options for treating cancer have multiplied, it
has become important not only to make the diagnosis of cancer, but
to subclassify tissue and grade it as more or less aggressive and
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very delicate classifications, and to some extent
subjective and dependent on the experience of the pathologist,''
said Dr. Juan Rosai, who recently was chief of pathology at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center but became chief of
pathology at Italy's National Cancer Institute. The difference in
grade could influence whether someone gets surgery, chemotherapy,
radiation or no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   As the field of pathology grows more challenging, hospitals are
adopting new strategies and some health experts are advocating more
stringent rules for diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein and his co-authors, for example, are advocating that
when a diagnosis has been made at another institution, hospitals
require an in-house pathologist to examine a patient's slides
before beginning treatment. ``Hospitals shouldn't trust somebody
else's diagnosis to treat a patient,'' Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Many comprehensive cancer centers and academic medical centers
already have this type of policy in place, though it is not always
followed by some doctors. Among smaller hospitals, only some have
such policies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe hospitals should even go a step further by
insisting that every biopsy, not just referrals, be seen by at
least two sets of eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Large academic centers typically have a daily conference to
discuss difficult cases, and specimens can be viewed by a few
experts through a multiheaded microscope. These centers also have
many subspecialty pathologists, experts in gynecological cancer,
for instance, who tend to consult with each other informally.
</P>
<P>
   Some small institutions require two pathologists to be involved
in every cancer diagnosis, whereas others recommend that the
practice be used only with cancers that are more difficult to
diagnose. Some hospitals randomly send 10 percent of slides to
outside labs for quality control, Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Even where there are no formal procedures requiring them to do
so, it is common for pathologists to show ambiguous slides to
colleagues or to send them out to a nationally recognized expert
for review.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts question whether there is reason to require
widespread use of second opinions. ``On an individual basis,
getting a second opinion is obviously a good thing to do, but on a
health-care-wide basis, where you're asking the question of cost
effectiveness, this is a difficult question,'' Tomaszewski said.
</P>
<P>
   One solution may be to set guidelines specifying which types of
cancers and cases are more difficult and should be routinely
reviewed. Cancers with a higher likelihood of misdiagnosis include
those that are gynecological and lymphatic, as well as leukemia,
sarcomas and those of the prostate, skin, liver and kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Patients can take it upon themselves to request second opinions
on their biopsies. And some pathologists have seen an increase in
requests for second opinions made directly from patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a devastating diagnosis with so much implication for
treatment that I think it's perfectly reasonable to have a second
opinion,'' says Dr. William Hoskins, deputy physician and chief for
disease management at Sloan-Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein added: ``If I were a patient and was diagnosed with a
malignancy, I would get a second opinion before undergoing any
major surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. And if I had a negative
biopsy on an organ that's known to have a higher rate of error I'd
also get a second opinion.''

PLAYING SOLITAIRE AT WORK? SOFTWARE LETS EMPLOYERS TRACK YOUR
MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY E. NEVALA  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been used to catch a Connecticut embezzler and an Eastern
Washington electronic solitaire whiz playing on company time. An
Oregon law firm installed it to snag employees planning vacations
at work, and a Virginia consulting company fired a man after
watching him spend days e-mailing friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers use this to find out what's happening in their
business,'' said Richard Eaton, the Kennewick, Wa.-based developer
of Investigator, a software sleuth that nets employees who use
their computers to slack off or sneak around _ and more _ on
company time.
</P>
<P>
   Stealthy software programs like Eaton's enable employers to
watch every tap of the their employees' keyboard _ including
deletions never stored or used in the final version.
</P>
<P>
   Memos typed, e-mail sent, proposals drafted and Web sites
visited _ all can be viewed by bosses without the employees'
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator software users pooh-pooh their Orwellian powers and
lavish praise on a program they say tightens security and helps
eliminate workplace slouches and cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates worry about the fuzzy laws still
surrounding the workplace computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees often think they have privacy rights, when in fact
they have very little,'' said Jeff Mathias, an Iowa attorney and
employment law producer with the Seattle-based Prairielaw.com, a
legal issues Web site.
</P>
<P>
   No federal laws specifically address the issue, and in court
cases regarding workplace computer privacy, employers more often
emerge victorious, Mathias said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, former Microsoft employee Bill McLaren Jr. argued in
a Texas court that Microsoft invaded his privacy by reading his
e-mail stored in a ``personal folders'' application on his office
computer.
</P>
<P>
   The courts ruled for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument is that since the computer belongs to the
company, they have a right to view everything on it,'' Mathias
said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer monitoring is completely legal, said Eaton, who
describes his $99 Investigator software as ``a security audit
trail. It's there in case there is trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He has sold more than 6,500 licenses worldwide to corporations,
government agencies, businesses and private individuals since he
developed the program in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Daily sales jumped from five licenses to 20 this month after the
Wall Street Journal included Investigator in a story.
</P>
<P>
   Customers include Exxon Mobil Corp., Delta Air Lines, Lockheed
Martin Corp. and Ernst &AMP; Young LLP. Government users include the
U.S. State Department, the Navy and the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Competing computer-monitoring software Silent Watch, which
allows stealth surveillance of 50 computers from a central PC, has
enjoyed similar success, said Roy Young, vice president for sales
and marketing of Adavi Inc. in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last month our sales increased 53 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of similar programs, including pcAnywhere, Desktop
Surveillance, RealSecure and CyberCop can be purchased from
software companies or downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a demand,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of U.S. companies engage in electronic
surveillance of their employees, according to a 1999 American
Management Association survey. That includes companies which watch
Internet and e-mail, monitor telephone calls and use video
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Banking, brokerage, insurance and real estate industries lead
among those who monitor, the survey said. Performance review and
legal compliance topped the list of reasons for employee
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Nabbing cyberslackers, e-mail-happy employees and computer game
enthusiasts are others.
</P>
<P>
   In Orondo, Wash., John Auvil installed Investigator after
workers at his fruit company habitually shrugged at the ``no gaming
on company time'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty minutes after we installed it, boom, we caught someone
playing solitaire,'' said Auvil, the company's network
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty employee, a man killing time while defrosting company
refrigerators, received a verbal reprimand but still has his job.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Privacy Act, which prohibits recording private
communications by phone, radio, telegraph or other device without
the consent of all parties, does not apply to e-mail and online
chats, according to Spokane County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the judge in a Spokane case _ involving a man
trapped in a sting operation while seeking sex with minors he met
online _ ruled that Washington's privacy law does not apply to
computer communications.
</P>
<P>
   The words of the statute do not specifically mention computers
as a covered device, the judge concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have had little success passing workplace computer
privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   In October, California's governor vetoed a bill that would have
required employers to notify workers when monitoring e-mail traffic
and computer files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws like this are seen as anti-business and anti-industry,''
said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The American Management Association survey found that 84 percent
of companies inform their employees of surveillance policies
through bulletin board postings or during hiring orientations.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said he added a warning default statement commonly used on
government computers to his Investigator software.
</P>
<P>
   The statement is visible at the discretion of the installer
during the log-in sequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals using this computer system without, or in excess
of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities
on the system monitored and recorded by system personnel,'' it
reads in part.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Maltby, president of the non-profit National Workrights
Institute in New Jersey, argues companies could go a step further
than simply warning their employees that they are being watched.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that companies track the time people spend on the
Web, rather than spying on every Web site they visit.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of rummaging through every computer file, Maltby
said companies should specifically target the file in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, employers have a right to know if their employees are
doing illegal things. But if your boss wants to read your personal
e-mail for fun, he can do it,'' Maltby said. ``And that's just not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigator is nearly impossible for the user to detect and
even harder to kill from the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantastic,'' said a network administrator at a Portland, Ore.,
law firm after Investigator caught one of his employees building
personal home pages on company time and another scouring vacation
sites and buying books online.
</P>
<P>
   A Connecticut real estate manager last month used Investigator
to catch an employee siphoning money from his firm to her personal
bank account via a company computer.
</P>
<P>
   And in Virginia, Doug Dobrynski recorded two employees at his
government consulting business who spent their days
instant-messaging friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent entire days just goofing off. We're talking zero
productivity,'' said Dobrynski, the company's director of
management information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The company fired one employee and the other left voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said 90 percent of his Investigator licenses sell to
business and industry. Private individuals, from suspicious spouses
to parents of cybersavvy teenagers, make up the other 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Miki Compson, a Maryland mother of four daughters, programmed
Investigator to send daily reports of her teenagers' online
discussions to her laptop computer while she vacationed in
Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Compson said she worried about the strangers her children met in
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can trust your children to an extent, but you have to keep
their safety in mind,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton said he created Investigator's first version as a help
system to track tangles encountered by his software system testers.
</P>
<P>
   By seeing each keystroke, Eaton eliminated the problem-causing
guessing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When glitches happened we had no way of tracing that. We
couldn't see what caused the software to crash,'' Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has used Investigator for similar purposes, Eaton said. The
program allowed its scientists in one state to witness every detail
of computer work happening thousands of miles away, saving time and
money flying personnel across the country to monitor work.
</P>
<P>
   While Investigator and programs like it have ruffled some
feathers, ``they are neither good nor bad, they're just tools,''
said Bill Machrone, vice president of technology for Ziff-Davis, a
New York computer magazine publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   Software monitoring programs are like a hammer, he said. ``You
can build a house with a hammer, or you can kill somebody with
it.''

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ira Flatow is one of the most influential
communicators of science.
</P>
<P>
   His National Public Radio talkfest, ``Science Friday'' (2 to 4
p.m. Eastern time) is a weekly dialogue with scientists and members
of Flatow's audience of two and a half million listeners, who phone
in questions, ideas and opinions. And for six years, he was host
and writer of ``Newton's Apple,'' a PBS science program for
children.
</P>
<P>
   But don't call him a popularizer. ``You don't have to popularize
science,'' he said recently over coffee in Manhattan. ``All you
have to do is make it accessible to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Flatow grew up in Brooklyn and on Long Island. In 1971, not long
after graduating from the State University of New York at Buffalo
with an engineering degree, he began science reporting for NPR and
has been there since.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow, 51, lives in Connecticut with his wife, Miriam, and
their three children.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you describe what you do?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm a yenta. I can't wait to learn new things. And then to
tell people about them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. As a science yenta, how do you make complex subjects simple
enough for your listeners to understand?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First, I have to understand the story. And once I understand,
I can act like a transducer and translate it in plain English. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you're broadcasting, you break into your guests'
statements frequently. Didn't your mother teach you manners?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. She didn't tell me not to interrupt. (Laughs.) Look, I'm
trying to put science into English. I have a rule for guests:
``Stay away from jargon as much as you can because I'll be breaking
in and interrupting.''
</P>
<P>
   I tell them: ``I want you to make believe we are in your kitchen
sitting around having a nice chat.'' Then, I come into the studio
with two dozen questions in front of me. Most of the time, we never
get to them. A successful show takes on a life of its own. My goal
is for people to see that science can be as interesting a
conversational topic as Jennifer Aniston's wedding or stock
prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. As a child, did you grow up dreaming of someday becoming
Wizard, the television personality of the 1950s who introduced baby
boomers to the joys of science?
</P>
<P>
   A. I practiced it. I was the kind of kid who did experiments in
basements. I'd travel to Vesey Street in Manhattan and go through
electronics stores to pick up old radar parts and transistors. Then
back at home, I'd take a heavy duty wire-coil, plug the wire into a
wall socket and turn it until it glowed. That basically turned it
into a toaster. I'd get transformers and hook them up backward and
get mushroom clouds out of them by plugging them into the walls and
then melting them.
</P>
<P>
   I liked plugging stuff into the walls. As a kid, I almost blew
up my mother's bathroom trying to take chlorophyll out of leaves. I
was more worried about my mother finding out than I was about the
fact that I'd almost burned down the house. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do your listeners differ from those of, let's say, Rush
Limbaugh?
</P>
<P>
   A. Our audience runs the gamut: parking attendants, science
geeks, professors. When we got our first call from a homeless
person, I was impressed. He asked a very good, very intellectual
question. More often, we get professors because they want to hear
what colleagues are up to.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I sometimes get callers who are scientists
with contrary ideas to those of my guests. They'll call in and
complain, ``I've been trying to reach you for years, and you won't
return my call. Why won't you read my paper?''
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you make science visual on the radio?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You create shtick. I once got a letter from a woman in
Baltimore who wrote, ``My kids go into closets and they chew
wintergreen Lifesavers because they spark in the dark. What's this
about?'' So Susan Stamberg and I took a microphone into a closet at
the studio and starting chewing wintergreen Lifesavers while
describing to the listeners what was happening. ``If you folks out
there understand this phenomenon, call us and tell us about it,''
we said.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang off the hook. ``It's something called tribo
luminescence when you chew on a sugar crystal, the crystal breaks
down and creates a little spark,'' one listener explained.
``Francis Bacon wrote about this hundreds of years ago because he
used to keep sugar in a giant lump in the basement,'' another told
us.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, a tanker ran aground off Nantucket and they were
talking about whether or not all this oil was going to foul up the
ocean. So I said, ``Let's create our own oil spill.'' I got a
10-gallon fish tank, sand, artificial fish, and some No. 6 heating
oil. We created this oil spill in our tank and talked about it:
``Oh look, there are globules and some of them are sinking down to
the sand! They are getting stuck on the sand just like they say is
happening in New England.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is there so little science on commercial television?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There's a lot of medicine on the air, but not much science.
For science to get on commercial television, it has to be
sensational, polarized.
</P>
<P>
   I think part of the problem in TV is the media gatekeepers:
they're the people in charge of putting people like me on the air.
And they are often people, I believe, who had trouble with science
when they were in school. They just don't think science is terribly
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who's your favorite interview subject?
</P>
<P>
   A. Leon Lederman, the physicist. He's got a Nobel so he's got
credentials. He's not afraid to speak in a language we all
understand. Even though he's a serious scientist, he doesn't take
himself seriously. Most important, he's self-confident enough that
he's willing to admit that he doesn't know everything.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What made Carl Sagan so terrific a science-communicator?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. He was willing to suffer the slings and arrows of his
colleagues. Carl Sagan was despised by many in his field because he
was a popularizer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How critical of science policy are you willing to be on your
show?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We're critical that scientists are not proactive, that when
they really believe in something they don't take a stand. We're
critical about where funding goes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of the show's funders is the National Science Foundation.
Does the NSF's generosity create any conflict when you cover their
work?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If there is a conflict, we always mention that the NSF backs
the show. But that tie is going to end this year. At the end of
this year, we'll be totally backed by NPR. Actually, there isn't so
much a problem with them as some of the other funders of NPR. NPR
has underwriters who are from biotechnology companies and we are
doing more and more stories on biotechnology. Sometimes we'll have
guests who are funders. When that happens, we say it up front. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you consider yourself as a kind of missionary for science?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Because missionaries have to convert people. I don't have
to convert anybody. People love science to begin with, and they'll
take as much of it as you'll give them. &QL;
</P>

REMOVING HEALTHY BREASTS FOUND EFFECTIVE IN HIGH CANCER-RISK
GROUP 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   A desperate measure for reducing the risk of breast cancer,
removing both breasts while they are still healthy, has been proved
effective even for women who carry genetic defects that put them at
the very highest level of risk for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings come from the first long-term study to include
women with mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, which cause 5
percent to 10 percent of all cases of breast cancer. Women with the
mutations have a 56 percent to 85 percent chance of developing the
disease. Removing the breasts reduces the risk by 90 percent for
those women, according to a study presented Monday in San Francisco
at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted at the Mayo Clinic, included 214 women
considered high risk because breast cancer ran in their families.
All had their breasts removed as a preventive measure from 1960 to
1993. So far, of 148 who have been tested, 28 women had BRCA
defects, including 17 with defects specifically linked to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After a median of 15 years of follow-up, none of the 28 women
has developed cancer. There have been three cases of breast cancer
in the high-risk group despite the surgery, but none in women with
BRCA mutations. Overall, in a group of 214 high-risk women, 38
cases of breast would have been expected.
</P>
<P>
   The same researchers had already proved last year that breast
removal could protect women who had a strong family history of
breast cancer, and doctors had assumed that the findings would also
apply to women with BRCA defects. But they could not be sure,
because surgery had not been studied specifically in women known to
carry the mutations.
</P>
<P>
   The operation can never remove all breast tissue, and there was
always the possibility that enough mutant cells would evade the
scalpel to give rise to tumors later on.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings show that the surgery, prophylactic mastectomy,
does work. But not many women choose it, and it is controversial,
especially when treatments for women who already have breast cancer
are aimed at saving the breast whenever possible. In the study, the
number of cancer cases averted was small compared to the number of
women who had mutilating surgery and who might never have developed
cancer anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A patients' advocacy group, the National Breast Cancer
Coalition, said in a statement that very few women fall into the
high-risk category, and that although the surgery does appear to
help, it is drastic and ``should not be recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the operation provides the largest risk reduction
available. Another option is to take the drug tamoxifen, but it
reduces risk by only 45 percent, and can be taken for only 5 years.
It is not clear how long the protection lasts, and tamoxifen may
cause blood clots or uterine cancer in some women.
</P>
<P>
   Women at risk can also have frequent mammograms and breast
examinations in hopes of catching the disease early enough to cure
it, but it is not clear how well that approach works.
</P>
<P>
   The new information was presented by Dr. Lynn Hartmann, a
medical oncologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and an
author of the 1999 article showing that the operation worked. The
214 women she reported on Monday were part of a group of 639 who
had their breasts removed and had a risk reduction of 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the original study, the researchers calculated the risk
reduction by comparing women who had the surgery to their sisters
who had not, and finding more breast cancer in the sisters who had
not had the operation.
</P>
<P>
   But at first, the researchers did not know whether any of the
women had BRCA mutations. They have since gone back and begun
performing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Hartmann said she did not think her findings would change
doctors' or patients' minds about prophylactic mastectomy. ``I have
not seen waves of women coming forward to do this,'' she said,
estimating that the operation is done only 10 to 15 times a year at
the Mayo Clinic. ``For women who are interested, the data just help
them believe in the effectiveness of it. If a woman is not inclined
in this direction, this is not going to change her preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Payne, a psychologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center in New York, said he counsels about one woman a month
who is considering the preventive surgery. Most go ahead with it,
and he said it was good news that the operation has proved
effective. But he also said that the data would not be used to push
women into having their breasts removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's elective surgery, with incredible ramifications for body
image,'' he said. ``Our job to some degree is to slow down the
process and make sure they're thinking through every part of it.''

`MONDO DESPERADO': ECCENTRICITIES IN A SMALL IRISH TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title of Patrick McCabe's new novel, ``Mondo Desperado,''
comes, of course, from the 1963 Italian movie ``Mondo Cane,'' that
so-called ``shockumentary'' that chronicled the varieties of human
bizarreness around the world. McCabe's contrived little stories do
not range so widely about the globe. Rather they chronicle the
eccentricities and self-deceptions of people living in the small
Irish town of Barntrosna, ``a one-horse town'' whose innocent
facade hides ``a reality as shocking as any seething mass of
serpents uncovered by two arms sunk deep in a barrel of seemingly
fragrant, beguiling potpourri.''
</P>
<P>
   It is McCabe's conceit that these stories were written not by
him but by a local hack named Phildy Hackball, and it's easy for
the reader to understand why he would have wanted to hide behind
such a fictitious author. Although ``Mondo Desperado'' borrows the
premise of Sherwood Anderson's ``Winesburg, Ohio'' _ a series of
tales depicting individual ``grotesques'' meant to provide a group
portrait of a town _ it does so with none of Anderson's insight or
conviction. For that matter, the book pales next to McCabe's own
earlier works like ``The Butcher Boy'' (1993) while reprising many
of his favorite themes.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Butcher Boy,'' ``Mondo Desperado'' limns the
suffocating atmosphere of small-town life and the alienation
experienced by those who defy its provincial mores. And like
``Breakfast on Pluto'' (1998), it chronicles the efforts of such
outsiders to cope by fleeing into fantasy and dreams. The
difference is that the enormous sympathy McCabe lavished on his
earlier heroes _most notably on Francie Brady, the lonely, deranged
boy turned psychotic murderer in ``The Butcher Boy'' _ is nowhere
to be found in these pages. The characters in ``Mondo Desperado''
are flimsy, laughable creatures, stupid, self-deluding or venal,
and quite bereft of the humanity the author's earlier protagonists
possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the tales in ``Mondo Desperado'' depict people who
allow paranoia or wishful thinking to push them into embarrassing
delusions. The narrator of ``Hot Nights at the Go-Go Lounge''
allows a friend's casual remarks to convince him that his wife has
a secret life, hanging out in basement dives with two-bit
musicians, ``popping quaaludes and shoveling gin like it's going
out of fashion.'' The narrator of ``My Friend Bruce Lee'' believes
that the famous kung-fu expert has come to his apartment and shared
a Chinese dinner with him, despite all the evidence that his
friends have made him the butt of a practical joke. And the
narrator of ``I Ordained the Devil'' persuades himself that a
successful rival priest is actually Satan in disguise, attributing
to him virtually every untoward act that has occurred in the
village in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Though these characters tell us their stories directly, McCabe
makes their naivete laughable: Instead of being invited to share
their inner lives, we are asked to stand back and laugh at their
dimness and gullibility. This same dynamic is at work in the story
of Tom Gully, a farmer with a huge boil in the middle of his
forehead: When Tom meets a beautiful, flirtatious woman in a bar,
he thinks he has finally found true love; when he wakes up the next
morning, he is shocked _ shocked! _ to discover that the woman has
disappeared with all his money.
</P>
<P>
   Other stories in ``Mondo Desperado'' showcase McCabe's gothic
imagination. But while he managed, in ``The Butcher Boy,'' to blend
the supremely ordinary and the startlingly horrific into a seamless
whole, here his shock effects seem like shallow afterthoughts,
clumsily grafted onto his tales for the sole purpose of unnerving
the reader. One story ends with a boy being blown to bits with an
air pump inserted into his rectum; another, with a man and his
nephew being beaten, kidnapped and forced to perform in
pornographic films. A third tale of persecution and revenge
concerns a family curse brought on by a doctor's botched efforts to
create a hybrid being that's part human, part mule.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Mondo Cane,'' these stories are meant to make us marvel
at the oddness of the human condition, but McCabe's writing is so
awkward that we come away thinking, merely, that his tales are
contrived. ``The Luck of Dympna Wrigley'' is a dark and thoroughly
implausible fairy tale about a woman who abandons her mother,
becomes a whore, and then meets her Prince Charming. And ``The
Forbidden Love of Noreen Tiernan'' tells an equally hokey story
about a sweet, good-hearted nurse who leaves Barntrosna for London
and becomes a razor-wielding crook. When her mother and fiance turn
up in the city looking for her, she obediently leaves her new life
behind and returns home with them.
</P>
<P>
   These stories do not come together to create a persuasive
portrait of Barntrosna; nor do they stand on their own as
compelling fictions. Instead of giving us a window on a desperate
world, they give us the spectacle of a gifted writer inexplicably
masquerading as a hack.

come any earlier than this summer. Appeals could last years. A look

<P>
   MICROSOFT-CONSUMER _ Consumers shouldn't expect any real change
in how their computers work, what products are on the market, and
how much they pay. But long-term some of the penalties could change
personal computing. For instance, it's very possible that the Web
browser portion of Windows will be split off, creating more
competition. And prices could eventually fall. (Husted, Atlanta

_ including from Microsoft and the government _ that discuss the

<P>
   MICROSOFT-WIRELESS _ One of the options open to Microsoft is to
explore new fields where it can dominate. One of those options is
to emphasis the use of wireless access to the Web. Katz visited

Washington headquarters. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   MICROSOFT-JUDGE _ WASHINGTON _ In the early days an earlier
stage of federal antitrust action against Microsoft Corp., when the
company insisted that the Windows 95 operating system wouldn't work
without its Internet browser, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson separated them himself with the help of a court technician.
Jackson's dive into the technical aspects of the case is indicative
of his approach to law. (Regan, Cox News Service).

   COXNET PTECH 0404 _ A high-tech community in Arizona is using a
sophisticated network to bring neighbors together. DC Ranch, with
200 homes occupied and another 6,000 slated for construction, has
made high-speed Internet connections a standard feature of the
houses it sells. Its quiet, cactus-studded streets and upscale
homes are wired with fiber optics and coaxial cable to provide each
household with at least two high-speed, ready-to-surf Internet
connections, six e-mail addresses, and digital TV and telephones _
all for $50 a month. (Holmes, Cox Washington Bureau) Art includes

executive vice president is someone you take seriously, even when
he moves against the grain of conventional thinking. About a month
ago, as the Lakers were about to face Portland in the most
anticipated game of the NBA season, West said that, dominant
records notwithstanding, maybe they weren't the two best teams in
the league. You might recall West having said, ``The Spurs have to
be favored to win the title. Why? Because of the two big guys. They
may not excel in the backcourt or at small forward, but it's hard
to stop them when you've got to shoot over the top of Tim Duncan
and David Robinson.'' Some, Spurs' guard Steve Kerr among them,
thought West was merely deflecting pressure from his Lakers.
``Favorite'' was not a word Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich associated
with the defending champions. (Rosner, Austin American-Statesman).

 &HT;    MICROSOFT LAWSUIT COST BOTH SIDES MILLIONS
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's decade-long antitrust battle
against Microsoft Corp. has cost taxpayers an estimated $15
million, and the tally could be millions more before the last
appeal is filed and the last court order signed.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides in the case have been reluctant to disclose
exact costs, the Justice Department bowed to congressional pressure
last fall and provided an accounting for $13.3 million for several
legal actions against Microsoft dating back to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That includes $7 million to finance the current lawsuit, which
was filed in May 1998, through last October. Since then, continuing
government work on the case has almost certainly pushed the total
up about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   That does not include expenses for 20 states that also have been
involved in the Microsoft suit and which have not disclosed how
much they are spending. Nor does it count what the company itself
has spent in its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mounting costs, pursuing Microsoft has cost less
than earlier titanic cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would hope that it wouldn't cost as much,'' said Joe Sims,
an antitrust lawyer who once served as the second-ranking Justice
Department official. He noted that the case that broke up the AT&AMP;T
telephone monopoly, estimated by published reports at $34 million
in current dollars, took eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The government spent 13 years on its unsuccessful attempt to
break up the computer giant IBM, Corp., and that case has been
estimated to cost $29 million in current dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The current Microsoft case has taken only two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said the expense to the Justice Department has been modest
enough so that ``you could argue about whether it make sense on
substantive grounds to file the case, but not according to the
expense.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Justice Department has enjoyed one break in the
Microsoft case. Its star prosecutor is private attorney David
Boies, who earlier beat back the government's attempts to break up
IBM. Boies has agreed to work for the government at an annual
salary of $104,000, which works out to about $50 an hour, a tenth
of his usual fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea what Microsoft has spent,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Microsoft have said the company's spent $1 million
each week during the opening phase of trial in U.S. District Court
here, which took more than four months. In one symbol of the
spare-no-expense defense, an expert witness testified that he was
paid $250,000 by the company.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, company lawyers spent 3,000 hours on their
unsuccessful attempts to reach an out-of-court settlement,
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates told reporters last weekend in a
conference call. With lawyers, led by the Wall Street firm of
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, charging rates of $500 an hour, the failed
talks cost the company at least $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the growing legal costs for Microsoft, the
company's most recent financial report says that it spent $506
million for ``general and administrative costs'' in the quarter
ending last December, an increase from $149 million the prior year.
The report cited ``increased legal fees'' as one reason.
</P>
<P>
   The expenses are not likely to break to the world's leading
software company, which also reported that as of last Dec. 31 it
had $17.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, plus $100
million in ``standby'' lines of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft might need some of its cash if it chooses to fight the
Justice Department with appeals all the way to the Supreme Court, a
process some believe could take up to four more years.

category. Some, as noted, will also move in the (w) Washington
category.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is almost
certain to rule Microsoft violated federal antitrust law. The big
shoe to fall will be the penalty stage of the ruling that won't
come any earlier than this summer. Appeals could last years. A look
at what those penalities could be and what the tactics of both
sides, the government and Microsoft, are likely to be during this
period. It's predictable that Microsoft will try to put a PR spin
on the event and that'll be included too. (Glass, Cox News
Service). 50-60 _ With optional trim for papers wanting a shorter
story.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT LAWSUIT COST BOTH SIDES MILLIONS
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's decade-long antitrust battle
against Microsoft Corp. has cost taxpayers an estimated $15
million, and the tally could be millions more before the last
appeal is filed and the last court order signed.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides in the case have been reluctant to disclose
exact costs, the Justice Department bowed to congressional pressure
last fall and provided an accounting for $13.3 million for several
legal actions against Microsoft dating back to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That includes $7 million to finance the current lawsuit, which
was filed in May 1998, through last October. Since then, continuing
government work on the case has almost certainly pushed the total
up about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   That does not include expenses for 20 states that also have been
involved in the Microsoft suit and which have not disclosed how
much they are spending. Nor does it count what the company itself
has spent in its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mounting costs, pursuing Microsoft has cost less
than earlier titanic cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would hope that it wouldn't cost as much,'' said Joe Sims,
an antitrust lawyer who once served as the second-ranking Justice
Department official. He noted that the case that broke up the AT&AMP;T
telephone monopoly, estimated by published reports at $34 million
in current dollars, took eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The government spent 13 years on its unsuccessful attempt to
break up the computer giant IBM, Corp., and that case has been
estimated to cost $29 million in current dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The current Microsoft case has taken only two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sims said the expense to the Justice Department has been modest
enough so that ``you could argue about whether it make sense on
substantive grounds to file the case, but not according to the
expense.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Justice Department has enjoyed one break in the
Microsoft case. Its star prosecutor is private attorney David
Boies, who earlier beat back the government's attempts to break up
IBM. Boies has agreed to work for the government at an annual
salary of $104,000, which works out to about $50 an hour, a tenth
of his usual fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea what Microsoft has spent,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Microsoft have said the company's spent $1 million
each week during the opening phase of trial in U.S. District Court
here, which took more than four months. In one symbol of the
spare-no-expense defense, an expert witness testified that he was
paid $250,000 by the company.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial, company lawyers spent 3,000 hours on their
unsuccessful attempts to reach an out-of-court settlement,
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates told reporters last weekend in a
conference call. With lawyers, led by the Wall Street firm of
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, charging rates of $500 an hour, the failed
talks cost the company at least $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the growing legal costs for Microsoft, the
company's most recent financial report says that it spent $506
million for ``general and administrative costs'' in the quarter
ending last December, an increase from $149 million the prior year.
The report cited ``increased legal fees'' as one reason.
</P>
<P>
   The expenses are not likely to break to the world's leading
software company, which also reported that as of last Dec. 31 it
had $17.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, plus $100
million in ``standby'' lines of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft might need some of its cash if it chooses to fight the
Justice Department with appeals all the way to the Supreme Court, a
process some believe could take up to four more years.

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending March 25 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   BKN-LAKERS-WEST _ Jerry West is an astute judge of basketball
talent who measures his words carefully. The Los Angeles Lakers
executive vice president is someone you take seriously, even when
he moves against the grain of conventional thinking. About a month
ago, as the Lakers were about to face Portland in the most
anticipated game of the NBA season, West said that, dominant
records notwithstanding, maybe they weren't the two best teams in
the league. You might recall West having said, ``The Spurs have to
be favored to win the title. Why? Because of the two big guys. They
may not excel in the backcourt or at small forward, but it's hard
to stop them when you've got to shoot over the top of Tim Duncan
and David Robinson.'' Some, Spurs' guard Steve Kerr among them,
thought West was merely deflecting pressure from his Lakers.
``Favorite'' was not a word Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich associated
with the defending champions. (Rosner, Austin American-Statesman).

 By MARK DERR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After splitting genetically from wolves about 135,000 years ago,
dogs have followed humans through every step in their cultural and
social development, from hunting and gathering to agricultural
societies, from the farm to the city and suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The dog has helped domesticate sheep and cattle, served
selflessly as a guard, beast of burden, guide, and companion
capable of easing the pain of loneliness. So closely entwined are
their lives that a number of evolutionary biologists argue that
dogs and humans have evolved together.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, a loose-knit band of scientists in
laboratories in the United States and abroad have worked diligently
to bring man's esteemed friend, wagging its tail behind, into the
postindustrial, postmodern age of the genome. Compared with the $5
billion Human Genome Project, the dog effort resembles a poorly
capitalized cottage industry, but researchers have recently begun
to speed the search for disease-causing genetic mutations in dogs,
which often have human counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a small group of people who want to map the dog genome
for a variety of reasons, including the study of human genetic
diseases,'' said Dr. Gregory Acland, a research scientist at the
James A. Baker Institute for Animal Health at Cornell University.
``The dog might also be the best model for looking at the genetics
of behavior. Beyond that, most of us just like dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The dog seemingly changed little in appearance from the wolf
until some 15,000 years ago, when it began to move with humans into
more permanent settlements, according to Dr. Robert Wayne, an
evolutionary biologist at the University of California at Los
Angeles. Since that time, through conscious and unconscious
selection, humans have created more than 400 breeds with greater
variability in size and shape than any other species, with the
exception of humanity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Breeders have traditionally relied on the ``founder effect,''
mating popular sires to numerous females to spread their
characteristics rapidly, and inbreeding, mating related descendants
of that dog to fix the traits they want, according to Dr. Donald
Patterson, a professor of medicine and medical genetics at the
University of Pennsylvania. If a popular sire also happens to carry
a genetic defect, it too spreads rapidly through the line.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, Patterson has maintained a database now
listing 370 genetic disorders in dogs, with 5 to 10 new ones added
each year. (By comparison, there are some 5,000 identified human
genetic disorders.) Like behavioral and physical characteristics,
those canine diseases and the responsible mutations tend to
segregate according to breed, with many prone to more than one
affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, progressive retinal atrophy, a form of hereditary
blindness, is caused in different breeds by a mutation to any one
of at least seven different genes, according to Dr. Gustavo
Aguirre, a professor of ophthalmology at Cornell's Baker Institute.
In 1998, his research team, including Acland, located a marker for
the gene causing heredity blindness in Labrador retrievers,
Portuguese water dogs, poodles, American and English cocker
spaniels, and possibly five other breeds. (Because of hybrid vigor,
mixed breed dogs suffer from genetic disease far less than their
purebred cousins.)
</P>
<P>
   Progressive retinal atrophy is the equivalent of retinitis
pigmentosa in humans. In fact, nearly 60 percent of the genetic
disorders in dogs correspond to genetic diseases in humans,
Patterson said, including epilepsy, cancer, deafness, blindness,
autoimmune disorders, congenital heart disease, skeletal
malformations, neurological abnormalities and bleeding disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closed gene pools and extensive pedigrees of purebred dogs
make them ideal for mapping genetic diseases that have been
intractable in humans,'' said Dr. Elaine Ostrander, head of the
human genetics program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle. Ostrander is studying the genetics of breast and
prostate cancer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Dr. Jasper Rine, a professor of genetics at the
University of California at Berkeley, and Ostrander, then a staff
scientist in his laboratory, conceived of using the dog to examine
how genes shape specialized behavioral and physical
characteristics, as well as disease. In the process, they would
establish a genetic map that could be linked to that of humans,
with whom dogs share 80 to 90 percent of their genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   Rine is no longer involved, but Ostrander has continued as
coordinator of the Dog Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   She and a core group of 15 researchers from laboratories in the
United States and Europe have created and are rapidly expanding
several different maps showing the location of hundreds of
signposts, or markers _ genes and microsatellites, which are
repetitive strands of genetic code, with an unknown meaning, that
are useful for tracking familial inheritance of genetic traits and
finding the genes.
</P>
<P>
   They have also created a database containing cloned stretches of
canine chromosomes. At any one time, 50 to 100 laboratories
worldwide are drawing on the project's resources and contributing
new data, according to Ostrander. Reviewing progress to date for
the March 2000 issue of Trends in Genetics, Ostrander and her
co-authors, Patterson of Penn and Dr. Francis Galibert of the
University of Rennes in France estimate that ``the majority of the
canine genome is now assigned to its corresponding part of the
human map.''
</P>
<P>
   But assigning the markers used in the mapping to specific canine
chromosomes, an essential process to exploiting the data's full
potential, has proceeded more slowly. Although the canine genome,
like that of humans, is estimated to have three billion base pairs
of DNA and 100,000 genes, they are distributed over 78 chromosomes,
compared with 46 in humans. To date, only about two-thirds of the
dog chromosomes have been identified, many of them by the Animal
Trust Fund in England, and fewer than half of the existing markers
have been assigned to chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   Incomplete as it is _ and researchers emphasize that the dog
genome itself may never be fully sequenced without specific
financing _ the material that does exist has opened a new season in
the hunt for defective genes. Since 1989, scientists have
identified and characterized 21 specific canine disease genes, half
of them since 1996, and markers have been found for others,
according to Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most spectacular was the discovery in 1999 of the gene
and mutations responsible for narcolepsy in Doberman pinschers,
Labrador retrievers and dachshunds by Dr. Emmanuel Mignot, an
associate professor of psychiatry at the Stanford University School
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog unlocked the mystery of narcolepsy in humans so that
we can now work to develop new treatments and better understand
sleep,'' Mignot said. Given the pace of discovery, Acland predicts
that ``all single-gene disorders in the dog will be eliminated
through genetic testing and selective breeding within the next 20
years.'' The American Kennel Club's Canine Health Foundation and 60
breed clubs are supporting much of that work.
</P>
<P>
   Even disorders caused by unknown combinations of genes may soon
be better understood. Dr. George Brewer, a professor of human
genetics and internal medicine at the University of Michigan,
believes he will begin to unravel the genetics of hip dysplasia, a
disabling form of osteoarthritis that afflicts many breeds, in the
next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging as those advances are, the Dog Genome Project has
yet to contribute significantly to its initial goal of
understanding morphology and behavior. Rine said that with the
human and mouse projects drawing to a close, it was time to
sequence the entire dog genome. That would not only accelerate the
search for individual genes but help scientists understand more
complicated questions about the nature of the dog, its incredible
talents and the origin of breeds.

PROSPECT OF ISRAELI PULLOUT INCREASES ANXIETY ON ISRAELI-LEBANESE
BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FATMA PASSAGE, Israeli-Lebanese Border _ Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Monday that he did not expect a military confrontation
after Israeli troops withdraw from southern Lebanon this summer,
and that he foresaw no need for a significantly larger
multinational peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   But here on the border, the commander of Israel's southern
Lebanese allies radiated anxiety about the consequences of the
planned withdrawal for the residents of a region that has been a
proxy battleground for Middle Eastern adversaries. The commander,
Gen. Antoine Lahad, wearing soft white leather loafers and a
worried expression, said defiantly that his forces would not
disband and flee but stay put and ``defend their land unto the
death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to stay in their homes,'' he said of his people.
``They want to die in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Barak moves steadily closer to his July deadline for ending
the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, his hopes for doing so
in the context of an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement are fading
fast. Speaking sanguinely in Jerusalem Monday, he addressed a
rising concern that a unilateral troop withdrawal could produce
violent chaos in the border region or even provoke a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that there is an immediate danger of a
flare-up of any kind,'' he said, expressing determined confidence
that Israel's military strength, combined with international
support for its withdrawal, would discourage any attempt to
escalate the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The military forces in this border region have moved into full
preparation for a complete shake-up of the decades-long balance of
power in the nine-mile-deep buffer zone. Locked in their war rooms,
the Israeli army, the South Lebanese militia, the U.N. forces and
the Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas are all devising battle
plans, and end-of-battle plans.
</P>
<P>
   At the physical heart of the security zone conflict is the
Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army commanded by Lahad, who strongly
opposes a unilateral pullout by Israel. ``If it is Israel's
decision to leave without security or peace established, well, then
it is Israel's decision,'' he said at a briefing sponsored by the
Israeli army. But he also said Monday, for the first time since the
Israeli Cabinet voted to withdraw the troops, that he and his
fighters had decided not to abandon their struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Lahad said he had changed his mind about seeking asylum abroad
now that the possibility of Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese
agreements are dimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm responsible not only for the South Lebanese Army, but for
the 70,000 to 80,000 people in the area,'' said the general, who
was widely believed to be contemplating a new life in France, where
his family lives. ``I would be viewed by them as a traitor if I
left now.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace agreements would presumably have spelled out the future
for the population of the security zone and for the 2,500 fighters
of the South Lebanese Army, many of whom have been convicted of
treason by the Lebanese military courts and sentenced in absentia
to punishments including death.
</P>
<P>
   Without such agreements, Lahad said his soldiers would defy
Lebanese forces seeking to regain control of the area unless they
were granted amnesty for their convictions in absentia. Using a
very strong analogy, he mentioned the ``Masada precedent,''
referring to the ancient Jews who committed suicide on a hilltop
above the Dead Sea rather than be taken captive by Romans.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli journalist, Yoram Hamizrahi, who used to be a
commander in southern Lebanon, said on the Israeli radio Monday
that Lahad's extreme statements ``should not be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Lebanon, they say, ``There is no tax on words,''' he said.
``Antoine Lahad is not going to kill himself. There is not going to
be any Masada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who believes that the SLA, which is supported by the
Israeli army, can suddenly turn into an army of heroes that can
fight on its own against Hezbollah _ anyone who believes that is an
utter fool,'' Hamizrahi said. ``Yet Antoine Lahad's statements
today are dangerous because they hint that the fence will not be
closed, they hint that southern Lebanon will remain under Israeli
patronage.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat out of sync with Lahad's thinking, a senior Israeli
military official made an unequivocal pledge Monday on behalf of
Israel to take care of the southern Lebanese. Standing by the side
of his South Lebanese Army counterpart, Brig. Gen. Beni Ganz said
Israel would be ready to absorb the entire population of the
southern Lebanon security zone if it sought refuge in Israel. Ganz
quickly said that it was more a statement of principle than a
concrete plan, because most of the Lebanese have no desire to
become refugees in Israel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Israeli army is believed to be scouting locations for
the resettlement of South Lebanese Army soldiers _ in the northern
towns of Nahariya and Metulla, for instance _ and to be negotiating
with third countries to relocate some high-ranking officers.
</P>
<P>
   In Metulla, eight Israeli employers have banded together to seek
government permission to sponsor the relocation of their 100
southern Lebanese workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to tell you how terrified they all are,''
said Miriam Hod, 49, who owns the Bet Shalom Motel. ``They're sure
they're going to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can barely function, they're so worried. I think that the
state of Israel has a moral obligation towards these people. There
is going to be a massacre there. I am the daughter of Holocaust
survivors, and I know we have to do something to save them.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to such anxiety, Ganz said he believed that the
withdrawal would take place in the context of some kind of
``arrangement,'' if not a peace agreement. He presumably referred
to an arrangement with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak said his confidence that violent chaos would be
averted was partly inspired by his ``memory of how effective the
Lebanese were in disarming other militias and pacifying other parts
of Lebanon.'' He said he believed that the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon, which comprises 4,500 troops, would be able to handle the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure that there will be a need for any extra
forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who stood by Barak's
side Monday, added that he did not believe that U.S. troops would
get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Barak continued: ``If there is a will, there is a way to solve
this issue. But we are not going to lead it. We will pull out to
the border out of our own interests, and we will defend Israel and
its interests from our borders. We don't have a claim on a single
square mile of Lebanese territory.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will push off the Atlantic Seaboard
ahead of a cold front crossing the Appalachians on Tuesday. Very
mild, moist air along the East Coast will be replaced by cooler and
drier air from the west. However, a disturbance over the Tennessee
Valley will sponsor a chilly rain on the west slopes of the central
and southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms are likely near the Southeast coast.
Meanwhile, brisk winds from the northwest will combine with
residual clouds and sprinkles to produce a gray day in the Ohio
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, dry air over the South will yield to a brighter and warmer
afternoon. A surge of very warm air will cover the Rockies, but the
Northwest will become cooler with more clouds and scattered
showers. The Southwest will remain warm, though clouds will be
nestled along the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOCUS: APRIL TORNADOES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the monthly tally of tornadoes, May is the most
active in the nation, with an average of more than 160 twisters.
But April holds the dubious distinction of spawning more killer
tornadoes. With the speedy jet stream continuing to derive energy
from large north-south temperature contrasts in April, robust
Pacific disturbances still come ashore and then forge slowly east
toward the Plains. Ahead of the system, humid air streams inland
from increasingly tepid waters of the Gulf of Mexico. When potent
disturbances meet high humidity, killer twisters can result.

FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS.  MOVING IN THE
``E'' AND ``K''
 CATEGORIES) 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Live''? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the `washington Post' and the `New York Times'. ''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The Next Generation) to the current version (``Star Trek:
Voyager''), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment: Earth,'' sent an agent from the future into
Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the arms
race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infra structure, they don't fire
real weap ons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commen tary on
the virtues of anti-interven tionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Kahn, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled ``The Wrath of Kahn''.
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next
Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next'' ``Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country''),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' ''

&HT;     GUN MAKER'S DEAL WITH CITES, STATES COULD BACKFIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ State and local governments have embraced a
former enemy, Smith &AMP; Wesson, since it broke ranks with fellow gun
manufacturers by agreeing to introduce a series of safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's decision, which allows it to settle lawsuits
with more than 30 cities and counties, has alienated loyal
customers, firearms distributors and retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides plan to use their economic clout to influence the
company: Many police agencies are vowing to buy only Smith &AMP; Wesson
firearms but distributors and retail stores are refusing to stock
the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith &AMP; Wesson has made some powerful new friends but its new
enemies have a lot more clout when it comes to selling guns,'' said
Tom Diaz, a senior analyst with the Violence Policy Center and
author of the 1999 book ``Making a Killing: The Business of Guns in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will see a coordinated effort to unravel this
deal. ... This is a very vindictive industry,'' Diaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies account for 20 percent to 25 percent of
sales in the $1.5 billion-a-year gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the agreement, announced by President Clinton on
March 17, that allows Smith &AMP; Wesson to settle its lawsuits by
adopting a series of more than 100 measures, including mandatory
trigger locks and restrictions on distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, 65 cities and counties have agreed to try to use
their collective buying power to prod other gun makers to adopt a
similar code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capacity to squeeze manufacturers like a pincers
and hurt them in the marketplace,'' said New York Attorney General
Eliot L. Spitzer, a leader of the newly created Communities for
Safer Guns Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The gun industry and some consumers plan to squeeze back harder,
making Smith &AMP; Wesson a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Clinton's announcement, Smith &AMP; Wesson was part of the
industrywide resistance to lawsuits and other anti-gun efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident that no other major manufacturers will desert
this coordinated effort in favor of their own individual deal,''
said Robert Delfay, president of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the nation's largest firearms trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement contracts are eagerly sought by high-end gun
manufacturers, which often discount their handguns from the usual
retail price of about $500 each. Police contracts also give
companies bragging rights when marketing products to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson's main competitors in the police market _ Glock,
Beretta and Winchester _ have no plans to change their marketing
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Under its agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson said it would quickly
install gun locks on all the weapons it sells, introduce ``smart
gun'' technology permitting weapons to be fired only by their
owners and bar sales of its weapons at gun shows without a
background check.
</P>
<P>
   The company also agreed to sell its products only to authorized
dealers, who in turn must agree to receive training and to abide by
the same code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But many dealers are angry about the restrictions it places on
them. Many gun-rights activists are vowing to boycott the company
for caving in to gun-control forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ill-conceived action on the part of one of the most
revered names in the American firearms industry,'' Delfay said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of Smith &AMP; Wesson's largest single distributors, the
RSR Group in Florida, said last week it will no longer stock the
company's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to the difficult conclusion that we cannot
continue to do business with Smith &AMP; Wesson under the problematic
terms of their current agreement,'' the company said in a
statement. ``Although this agreement is being hailed by some as a
positive new development, it is our opinion as a wholesale
distributor in the shooting sports industry that its terms are
one-sided and fall short of offering any realistic solutions to the
problems concerning the criminal misuse of firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some critics of the gun industry doubt that the Smith &AMP;
Wesson deal can withstand the pressure from retailers, distributors
and gun-buying activists.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said the deal with Smith &AMP; Wesson ``is going to fall
apart'' because the brunt of the pain is felt by distributors and
dealers who can destroy the company in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sell a gun to every cop in America and that still is
not going to save Smith &AMP; Wesson,'' Diaz said.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ ``I mean, this is driving me crazy!'' says the
actor planted in the audience, interrupting the play and causing
the actors onstage to confront the impertinent intruder directly.
``This is the whole problem with 20th-century theater. This is part
of the reason nobody wants to buy a ticket. We used to get stories;
now we get interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that so? The question _ the issue, really _ is at the heart
of ``Anton in Show Business,'' a mischievously self-skewering
comedy by the pseudonymous playwright Jane Martin being staged at
the Actors Theater of Louisville as part of the annual Humana
Festival of New American Plays. It is a play about a play about a
small theater company putting on a play (``The Three Sisters''),
and thus consciously an example of the problem it addresses, often
with aching hilarity _ that the world of the theater is growing
ever more estranged from the straightforward business of telling
stories.
</P>
<P>
   And except that it doesn't have a rape (or the threat of one) in
it, as four of the six full-length works staged here do, ``Anton''
made an apt spokesplay for the festival, which ends here this week.
Long on appropriating, analyzing, reconstructing and deconstructing
stories, the festival plays were a little short on making them up.
That's a characterization only, not an overall judgment; several of
the works presented here seem destined for future life. But in
addition to Martin's invocation of Chekhov, one play examined the
life of Orson Welles, one was a contemporary adaptation of a Greek
tragedy and one, ``No. 11 (Blue and White)'' by Alexandra
Cunningham, told the story of a privileged high school rapist that
was clearly drawn from the Alex Kelly case in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Like two other plays that have recently opened in New York,
``The Hologram Theory,'' about the murder of a New York City club
kid, and ``Down the Drain,'' about Susan Smith, the South
Carolinian who killed her children, ``No. 11'' was an attempt to
examine the cultural resonance of an already foraged-over crime. It
failed for the same reason; it unearthed only the already familiar.
Tied to these stories, the issues feel exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   The general amalgamation in the entertainment universe (where
any story seems fair game for all media) seems particularly
threatening to the theater, which has long felt its relevance
slipping, its stories drowned out by the ever more clamorous din of
television and the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume of narrative to which we are exposed has made us
distance it,'' said Jon Jory, the producing director of the Actors
Theater, who founded the play festival 23 years ago. ``The
playwright lives in fear of hearing, `Oh, yes, that was a
television movie.' It objectifies narrative in a way that scares
us; we're all told we have to be tied into some larger
significance. I do sense, in young people, a fear that their
stories have become part of some Jungian pool and that they must
somehow find a way to tell the story of society. They feel an
intellectual pressure about this.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea saddened him, Jory said, sounding a lot like the spirit
of Jane Martin's play, which is pertinent because Jory is widely
thought to be Jane Martin (who is the nominal author of ``Talking
With'' and ``Keely and Du,'' among other plays) or at least the
chairman of a Jane Martin committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I can't tell you that,'' said 61-year-old Jory, when asked
directly if he is the playwright. But ``Anton in Show Business''
struck many at the festival this weekend as the valedictory
statement of a man who after this season is leaving the Actors
Theater, which he has led since 1969, to teach acting and directing
at the University of Washington in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Anton'' no element of the theatrical landscape escapes
satire. Self-involved actors, autocratic directors, romantic and
uninformed producers, complacent audiences, presumptuous critics,
cynical corporate sponsors all get their comeuppance here _ even
Actors' Equity, the union, one character says, that makes sure ``no
more than 80 percent of our membership is out of work on any given
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The barbs are insider-specific and most are affectionately
applied, and in the end the message is clear. The theatrical
enterprise has been so fouled by money problems, so twisted by a
culture of celebrity, so swaddled in intellectual pretension, that
the simple desire to put on a show, to tell a story onstage, has
been hopelessly _ almost hopelessly _ buried. What has risen in its
place is a hermetic theater world that talks to itself and whose
citizens are defensive and embarrassed about the fundamental joy
that drew them to the stage in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other highlights was ``Big Love,'' Charles L. Mee's
highly physical adaptation of the Aeschylus tragedy ``The Suppliant
Women,'' which turns the story of 50 sisters, who are promised in
marriage against their will and vow to murder their husbands on
their wedding night, into a modern-day war-of-the-sexes parable.
</P>
<P>
   It is a play staged on a wrestling mat because the actors are
called upon to hurl themselves about in remarkably vigorous
fashion; in twin set pieces, one with three women, one with three
men, the actors enact a fiercely violent ballet, with bruising
collisions and falls, conducted to screaming speechifying about the
irksome qualities of the opposite sex. Mee's script, an amalgam of
angry, essayistic monologues and jokey references to things like
hair products and Ken dolls, is also too often cornered into
preachy high-mindedness: ``Love trumps all,'' says the old woman
who is given the role of sage. ``Love is the highest law.'' Still,
the primordial, communal twitch of loins and heart has rarely been
so viscerally acted out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``War of the Worlds,'' conceived and directed by Anne Bogart and
written by Naomi Iizuka, is a deconstruction of the life of Orson
Welles. Even amid a rash of biography-based works, Welles has been
well scrutinized lately, the subject of a television movie, ``RKO
281,'' and a new play, ``Orson's Shadow'' by Austin Pendleton,
which had its premiere at Steppenwolf in Chicago this season and
will be remounted at the Williamstown Theater Festival this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bogart's production, which is to appear at the Next Wave
Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the fall, is visually
striking and very busy. Iizuka's script doesn't have the lyric
weapons to stand up to the staging pyrotechnics, but this is
nonetheless an intellectually engaging work, presenting Welles as a
self-defeating artist obsessed with capturing the truth of life
``within a frame'' and conducting a lifelong battle with the
standard he set for himself in his first movie, ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   The effective and clever narrative gimmick is that Welles' life
is presented as Welles presented the life of William Randolph
Hearst _ in flashback, with a reporter seeking the meaning of the
man's dying utterance. Kane said, ``Rosebud,'' of course; Welles,
we are told, said, ``Thorn.''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a series of scenes that are refracted mirrorings
of the film's, suggestive not only of parallels between Welles and
Kane but also of differences between the stage and the screen, the
separate but equal potency of metaphorical imagery offered live and
realistic imagery framed and shaped by film. The climactic moment
has a narrator intoning a list of Welles' credits as Welles himself
(in a stylish mimicry, without caricature, by Stephen Webber) is
piling chairs with haphazard fury at center stage, recalling Kane's
reckless despair as he tears down Xanadu, the mansion he built as a
monument to himself.
</P>
<P>
   The two original full-length stories at the festival (there was,
as usual, a program of 10-minute plays and, as there was last year,
a series of dial-in ``telephone plays'') both concerned rape. One,
``Touch'' by Toni Press-Coffman, is an inexpressibly windy piece
about the anguish of a young astronomer when his wife is abducted
and murdered. The other, ``Tape'' by Stephen Belber, is a
well-constructed if not-quite-credible psychodrama about two men
and a woman in a three-way fencing match over a long-ago sexual act
that may or may not have constituted rape.
</P>
<P>
   Quality aside, the fact that so many of the plays here focused
on the primitively charged subject of sexual violence seems another
sign of a theater fearful of losing an audience; see four of them
in a weekend and you begin to think of crotch-grabbing stand-up
comics. Indeed, the lingering impression left by the festival is
that in a competition with television and the movies for
straightforward stories of human experience, theater's diminished
confidence in its relevance is probably justified. What will
restore it is not yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my question would be if plays, doing plays, doesn't
speak to the culture, then examining why or satirizing why is kind
of beating a dead horse,'' the audience member complains in ``Anton
in Show Business,'' adding, after a beat: ``From the inside.''

 &HT;    Brewski bill a faint hope for beer snobs
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I'm no beer snob but ... Oh, why start off
with a lie? I am a beer snob and it's not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Other kinds of snobbery give you social standing, opportunities
to bully lesser men, but beer snobbery? It gets you no further than
video-game snobbery. (''I won't buy Tomb Raider V. They ruined
Laura Croft's purity of line.'')
</P>
<P>
   This is not an easy vice to pursue. You suffer the effects of
pretentiousness without the advantages. At parties, you are
discovered systematically rifling the cooler until you find
something, anything, with a long neck, maybe a foil wrapper and
certainly without a twist-off cap.
</P>
<P>
   In stores, you scan the shelves for labels with 19th-century
style lettering and Victorian dingbats on the labels _ sure hints
the liquid within may be dark and heavy.
</P>
<P>
   You can't go to the corner convenience store for lottery tickets
and a six-pack of Ye Olde Oat and Crankshaft Extra-Heavy Cream
Stout. (''You know it's the real thing because there's stuff
floating in it.'') People make fun of you for trying to order it in
public. And even the Florida Legislature works against you.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, the Legislature. It suppresses the sale of obscure
beers in the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   How? Well, since 1965, Florida has required that beer be sold in
only four sizes of bottles or cans _ 8 ounces, 12 ounces, 16 ounces
or 32 ounces. That's it. Because the rest of the world uses the
metric system, this has the effect of banning foreign beers from
</P>
<P>
   Florida unless they are specially packaged for the Florida
market.
</P>
<P>
   Big brewers and wholesalers like this arrangement. It keeps
pesky, small brewers out of the state and restricts foreign beers
lest they corrupt the palates of Florida's beer drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Good, old-fashioned protectionism served cold.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's beer wholesalers won't come out and say they support
the law because it limits competition. That would be un-American.
Instead, they make their campaign donations and talk about the
pernicious effects if consumers were faced with too many choices.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Morroni (R-Clearwater), chairman of the House
Regulated Industries Committee, says he is leaning against a bill
that would finally end this nonsense and allow stores to stock any
size beer bottle under 32 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   He says feels this way because ``it would allow larger beer
sizes on college campuses.'' Another factor might be $1,000 in
donations he received last election from the Florida Beer
Wholesalers' ``good government'' fund.
</P>
<P>
   As serious as the problem of college alcohol abuse is, I don't
think small bottles are a deterrent. Many students have figured out
that if they can't get drunk on one bottle of beer, they can buy
more than one bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Those college kids can be very, very clever.
</P>
<P>
   Beer wholesaler lobbyists argue that more choices on the shelf
would ``confuse consumers'' and force stores to waste money
stocking a greater variety of beers in different sized bottles.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad car dealers don't think that way. Parking lots would
look pretty grim if the state required all cars to be black and
built only in four sizes. But anything else would confuse consumers
and create needless costs, wouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   And bookstores that could sell only four kinds of books? That
would be really depressing _ but not at all confusing.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sadly silly law, but all efforts to fix it have died
quiet deaths, year after year. This would be a small thing, except
it vividly shows how selective our legislators are when they talk
about less government. They are willing to cut environmental
protections, scale back health and safety regulations and make it
harder to sue when manufacturers are negligent. But when it comes
to nonsensical government restrictions that exist solely to benefit
a few favored businesses that donate at election time, talk about
fighting government interference in the marketplace disappears
faster than a cold beer on a hot summer day.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to be able to drink Plump Muskrat Cloudy Ale in
400 milliliter bottles. That you can't do so in Florida is another
demonstration of the veto power of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-state beer snobs, drink your next one for me.

FOREIGN POLICY AND THE ENTERPRISE: TV'S `STAR TREK' OFFERS CRASH
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MISSED THIS.  MOVING IN THE
``E'' AND ``K''
 CATEGORIES) 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To analyze U.S. foreign policy, it takes a keen intellect, years
of study and a deep understanding of international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you could just watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, the popular science fiction show
has provided a stunningly accurate barometer _ make that a
tricorder _ for the nation's philosophy on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is bound to become a major issue in the upcoming
presidential election, so what better way for the candidates,
especially George W. Bush, to bone up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to sort Greeks from Grecians, Bush can keep
his phasers on stun and engage the warp drive. Trouble on ``Larry
King Live''? Have Scotty beam you up.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush gets behind in the polls, he can hint to the media that
Al Gore just might be a Borg. Given the vice president's robotlike
movements, who could argue?
</P>
<P>
   No need to crack those books when you can watch ``Star Trek''.
</P>
<P>
   The exploits of characters like Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and Capt.
Picard have created a unique forum to analyze _ and criticize _
U.S. foreign policy, said Howard Fienberg of the Statistical
Assessment Service, a Washington group that specializes in
scientific and social research.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, with the U.S. mired in the Cold War, ``Star
Trek'' offered parables about the folly of nuclear proliferation,
the danger of brinksmanship and the arrogance of superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was safe because it was a metaphor,'' said Fienberg, who
counts himself as a ``Trek'' fan. ``Because you put it out in the
realm of science fiction, you can think about these things in a
different way . . . as opposed to fighting it out the editorial
pages of the `washington Post' and the `New York Times'. ''
</P>
<P>
   The show's mythology has kept up with the times, morphing from a
pro-interventionist bent in the 1960s (the original show), to a
less aggressive, post-Vietnam style in the 1980s and '90s (``Star
Trek: The Next Generation) to the current version (``Star Trek:
Voyager''), which reflects the management-by-crisis of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing can match the original show for political
content and social commentary. The program, which first aired in
1966, presented a mirror image of the real world, with superpowers
dominating the action.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was represented by the United Federation of
Planets (along with Capt. James T. Kirk and the starship U.S.S.
Enterprise) while the Soviets were the Klingons _ violent,
underhanded enemies who would stop at nothing to vanquish Star
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Chinese were the Romulans, a mysterious, powerful enemy
that popped up every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   The show offered strong anti-nuclear proliferation themes. One
episode, ``Assignment: Earth,'' sent an agent from the future into
Earth's 20th century to frighten the superpowers out of the arms
race. In another, ``The Omega Glory,'' the Enterprise crew
encounters a planet where World War III has already been fought and
the Asians won.
</P>
<P>
   The show also proffered anti-interventionist rhetoric in the
form of the ``prime directive,'' the Federation's policy against
interfering in the development of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   But Capt. Kirk was more Douglas MacArthur than Colin Powell.
While paying lip service to diplomacy, he discarded the prime
directive (much like MacArthur defied Truman in Korea) when it
suited him.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode ``A Taste of Armageddon,'' the Enterprise is
dispatched to a solar system where two planets have been fighting
an interstellar war for generations.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve their culture and infra structure, they don't fire
real weap ons. Instead, battles are fought by computer, real people
are tagged as casualties and then willingly march into
disintegration chambers.
</P>
<P>
   This offends Kirk's sensibilities, so he and his trusty first
officer, Mr. Spock, roam the city, destroying the disintegration
chambers and pushing the planet to the edge of real war. Naturally,
they come to their senses, but the episode is hardly commen tary on
the virtues of anti-interven tionism.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology that surrounds the show and its companion films
has matured over the years. Kirk ultimately pays the price for his
earlier cavalier behavior. In the TV episode ``Space Seed'' Kirk
dumps a group of troublemakers on a planet and then forgets about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later (on the show and in real life), the Federation
stumbles over the group, who have been decimated because a nearby
planet exploded. They are led by Kahn, a genetically engineered
warrior from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Don't want to ruin it for you, but the resulting film is
subtitled ``The Wrath of Kahn''.
</P>
<P>
   Though the original show was canceled in 1969, the ``Trek'' myth
survived in ubiquitous reruns. Then, in 1987, came ``The Next
Generation,'' a kinder, gentler ``Star Trek'' that reflected the
Vietnam Syndrome that dominated U.S. foreign policy since the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to get involved, basically, in any conflict
overseas, for fear they'll get bogged down and trapped in it,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make sure they can win. . . . They're looking for
the cheap and easy Grenada-type conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Next Generation,'' the Enterprise (newer model, sans
mod bucket seats) is commanded by Jean-Luc Picard, a cerebral
Frenchman (more Powell than MacArthur) who follows the rules,
doesn't like to blow things up and employs a half-psychic
``counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have someone around to make sure everyone gets
along,'' Fienberg said. ``Whereas in the old show, if you don't get
along, you get shipped out or they put a red suit on you and you
get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kirk needed to talk, he got liquored up with the ship's
doctor, Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy. Picard chatted with the bartender
of the ship's lounge, which is more like a Portland coffeehouse
than any bar Kirk would be caught dead in.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the hated Klingons, still representing the Soviets,
have become a shaky ally, and their home world is in political
turmoil, mirroring the breakup of the Soviet Union. Keep in mind
that the early seasons of ``The Next'' ``Generation'' aired as the
Berlin Wall was coming down.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Kirk himself who sets the stage for the peace
treaty (in the film, ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country''),
shortly before Mr. Spock tells him that ``only Nixon could go to
China.'' Somewhere along the way, the Klingons are transformed from
bloodthirsty cutthroats to futuristic Samurai, just as the U.S.
began to de-demonize the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   In the two most recent shows, ``Deep Space Nine'' and
``Voyager,'' the Federation is on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Space Nine,'' which was canceled last year, placed the
characters on a far-flung space station, trying to keep the peace
among warring factions, much like recent U.S. efforts in China and
North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The station is filled with other races and species, who are
annoyed at the homogenous nature of the Federation. That relects
``how other nations resent the Americanization of their nations,''
Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``Voyager'' crew is lost in space, trying to deal
with problems as they come and somehow survive. That's a good
metaphor for Bill Clinton's foreign policy, Fienberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to get home,'' he said, ``and then this race
comes up saying you can't pass. And they're thinking, `How are we
going to get through this without getting killed?' ''

 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is campaigning in the crucial rust belt state of
Pennsylvania this week. In tow is Gov. Tom Ridge, the Catholic
pro-choice GOP member being mentioned as the kind of running mate
who could help Bush win the upper Midwest states he'll need to beat
Al Gore. Cox Newspapers' Jena Health reports that Bush will stay
over at the governor's mansion Monday night and is expected to
continue touting education with an address on character education
today.
</P>
<P>
   CLEANING UP THE RUST BELT
</P>
<P>
   Monday in Pennsylvania, George W. Bush took on an issue that Al
Gore has promoted since 1993. Bush went to the site of a former
Jones and Laughlin steel plant in Aliquippa that was cleaned up,
and unveiled a plan to speed up redevelopment of polluted
industrial sites. ``Prosperity will mean little if we leave to
future generations a world of polluted air, toxic lakes and rivers
and banished forests,'' he said. J&AMP;L Steel had left steel deposits,
or slag, behind. US Gypsum cleaned up the 117-acre site and built a
$120 million plant that will open in May, making sheetrock with
synthetic and recycled materials and without discharge into the
Ohio River.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACKS ON GIULIANI TEMPERED
</P>
<P>
   A subdued President Clinton took to the fund-raising trail
again, abandoning steaming criticism of his wife Hillary Rodham
Clinton's Republican Senate opponent, Rudy Giuliani, and casting
attacks on the GOP in general economic terms. Clinton headlined at
two events in Las Vegas that were expected to bring in $525,000 for
the Democratic National Committee. In Las Vegas, in contrast to a
fund-raiser in Washington the day before where he lambasted
Giuliani as a tool of the ``right-wing venom machine,'' Clinton
just talked about this fall's election hinging on what the parties
plan to do with the federal budget surplus. Later, he repeated the
message Monday in San Jose, Calif., at a $1 million fund-raiser for
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKED FROM THE OTHER SIDE
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that life on the Senate
campaign trail is harder than expected, especially for women. ``I'm
almost embarrassed to think back _ all the times that I would say
to my husband, `Well, you could have said this differently, or you
could have done that,''' she told about 100 people at a community
forum in Coxsackie, N.Y. ``Now, I would like to take all those
words back because it's very tough for both men and women,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH WON'T GIVE UP ON CALIFORNIA
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is taking pains to show he won't let history
repeat itself in California, eight years after his father ceded the
state early to Bill Clinton in a move that helped the Democrats win
back the White House. With symbolism and actions, Bush is seeking
to reassure jittery Republicans that he intends to fight for the
state and win _ just as his father did in 1988. One example: Even
though he's far behind Gore among Hispanics in the state, he's
going out of his way to seek their votes. But Gore is 10 points
ahead in the latest Field Poll, has a powerful ally in Gov. Gray
Davis, and the Clinton administration has had federal funds pouring
in recently.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER YEAR OF THE WOMAN?
</P>
<P>
   While 1992 was dubbed the ``Year of the Woman'' after four women
won Senate seats and 24 were elected to the House, 2000 is quietly
shaping up as the sequel. Women are seeking four of the 11 Senate
seats and six of the 18 House seats considered most competitive by
Congressional Quarterly. Women in top Senate races: Democratic Rep.
Debbie Stabenow challenging GOP Sen. Spencer Abraham in Michigan;
development executive Rebecca Yanisch against GOP Sen. Rod Grams in
Minnesota; Hillary Rodham Clinton facing Republican Rudy Giuliani
in New York; Democratic state Sen. Allyson Schwartz trying to
unseat GOP Sen. Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania; and in Washington
state, former Rep. Maria Cantwell and state Insurance Commissioner
Deborah Senn both are vying for the Democratic nomination to oppose
GOP Sen. Slade Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTAL GUIDANCE
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, President Clinton was far more popular among
women than among men as he sought a second term. Among women with
children at home, Clinton thoroughly dominated Republican Bob Dole:
Mothers preferred Clinton 60 percent to 37 percent. Today, in a
striking reversal for Democrats, mothers are solidly backing George
W. Bush. The gap is 11 points _ 52 percent to 41 percent _
according to independent pollster Andrew Kohut. Among fathers, Bush
is ahead of Al Gore by an even larger margin: 54 percent to 36

   READY TO TAKE THE MOUND FOR A SAVE IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   A Republican congressman who once had his eye on the New York
Senate race is shifting his gaze there again. Rep. Rick Lazio of
Long Island said his party is stumbling badly with Rudy Giuliani as
its Senate candidate against Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``We are in
the process of potentially blowing this race,'' he said. But Lazio
stopped short of saying Giuliani can't win. ``What I'm prepared to
say is we're less likely to win relative to myself or maybe even
another candidate who can bring the party together,'' he said.
Lazio said he could still replace Giuliani as the GOP candidate if
he gets the go-ahead from state GOP leaders, particularly Gov.
George Pataki.

<P>
   TURNING OUT THE LIGHTS NO SIMPLE TRICK
</P>
<P>
   There's still activity at Bill Bradley headquarters in West
Orange, N.J., where a skeleton crew is manning the phones. Though
his campaign is gutted and shrinking by the day, campaign and
federal officials say it could take years before ``Bradley for
President'' officially goes dark. That is because, having accepted
federal matching funds for the primaries, Bradley's campaign must
now undergo a federal audit to determine how much of its remaining
funds must be returned to the Treasury. The campaign had $2,957,650
on hand Feb. 29, and that doesn't take into account the money
raised and spent in March ahead of the March 7 Super Tuesday
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   VERBAL DIFFICULTIES OFF THE CUFF
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reports that George W. Bush, ad-libbing his
way through an education speech several days ago, vowed to remove
the federal ``cuff link'' that stymies local control of schools.
</P>
<P>
   PAPERS TAKE STOCK OF BUSH
</P>
<P>
   According to the Washington Post, George W. Bush faces questions
about his ``demeanor and intellectual maturity _ or `gravitas,' as
columnist George F. Will has put it _ (that) continue to dog him
and threaten to become a central issue in a presidential race that
many believe will be decided as much on personality as issues.''
And the New York Times, exploring Bush's ability to broaden his
base, concluded that ``Bush must immediately and emphatically
establish himself as an unconventional Republican who is less bound
by an unyielding conservative ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   GOT THE HORSE RIGHT HERE, HIS NAME IS . . .
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Quarterly handicapped the Republican veep field,
giving Elizabeth Dole 9-2 odds, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge 6-1
odds, retired Gen. Colin Powell 7-1 odds, and Indiana Sen. Richard
Lugar and New York Gov. George Pataki 12-1 odds. Others range from
15-1 to 1,000-1 (Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura).
</P>
<P>
   GRAHAM: WHY NOT ME
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), touting himself as a potential vice
presidential candidate, was quoted by ABC and the New York Times on
what he could bring to Al Gore on the ticket: ``I have had a long
association with some of the key issues in this campaign. ... I was
chairman of the education commission. ... I come from a large
state.''
</P>
<P>
   GREAT, IF HE'S RUNNING FOR BISHOP
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes is still running. He brought his message of
``restoring America's moral authority'' to Appleton, Wis., speaking
to about 500 people at Lawrence University's Memorial Chapel. Said
the Appleton Post-Crescent: ``The resemblance to a church service
didn't end there. Keyes' presentation is much in the style of a
tent show preacher, and so was his message. In fact, it wasn't
until the question-and-answer session at the end did he offer
specific policy proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   BILLIONAIRE COMES THROUGH
</P>
<P>
   Billionaire Eli Broad has given $1 million to the Democratic
National Convention's host committee in hopes of helping
fund-raisers meet their final goal. The donation is the first by
Broad to the organization he co-chairs, and it puts the
fund-raising total to date at $26.6 million of the $33.5 million
goal to cover convention costs. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan,
who recently took control of the host committee, has been urging
potential donors to help make up the nearly $7 million difference.
The convention is set for Aug. 14-17 in downtown L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ELVIS LIVES ON AND IS RUNNING FOR MAYOR
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Presley is alive and stumping for enough votes in the
Wisconsin North Woods to remake The King into a mayor. Make no
mistake, Elvis Presley is his legal name. The 50-year-old Elvis
impersonator and tavern owner is running for mayor today in
Phillips, a town of about 1,700 people. He sports deep sideburns
and has had dental work to look more like the late singer. But he
has dropped about 40 pounds from the days he fit snugly into a
white sequin jump suit.

   Published by the Boy Scouts of America, this magazine is fun for
Scouts and non-Scouts alike, offering easy-to-read articles,
age-appropriate advice, cartoons and puzzles. My favorite how-to
this month is a primer on replacing a bike tire inner tube. Such
knowledge is especially useful in Arizona, land of the angry thorn.
There is also a Q-and-A on camping, which counsels Scouts to pack
out their garbage and avoid scratching their names on trees or
burning down the forest. Keep in mind that the magazine does have
some religious overtones. This issue includes a short story on
Scouts visiting churches, chapels and temples to learn more about
other religions. With baseball season starting, there also is a
reprint of the Thayer poem, ``Casey at the Bat,'' and a short story
on a light-hitting Little Leaguer who saves the day. &QL;

<P>
   Answers the burning question, ``What's on Heather Graham's
Mind?'' which, after reading the story, we have to conclude is
``not much.'' Still in all, it's an amusing if self-conscious story
about the winsome actress, whose appearance in ``Austin Powers 2:
The Spy Who Shagged Me'' has vaulted her to instant cult status,
especially among the denizens of the Internet. It's funny to learn
that she first appeared in film as a dead junkie in ``Drugstore
Cowboy.'' In that inexplicable ``Esquire''-think, the magazine
lists the 18 most important golf courses in America, and then tops
the list with the Old Course at St. Andrews, SCOTLAND. They're
trying to be cute here, but it just doesn't work. There is also a
piece on golfer John Daly, he of the thunderous swing and alcohol
problem. Again, we have to wade through all the self-serving pap
about the writer palling around with Daly until we get to the real
story: Daly is losing but happy. I wonder if that is his final
answer. &QL;

   This is the camping issue, but hey, isn't every issue? Worth

heroin addiction _ twice. Now he's competing on the surfing
equivalent of a senior's tour. Who knew? There also is an
interesting piece on those so-called adventure races where people
scale cliffs and navigate rapids so they break their arms and legs
and are shown weeping on the Discovery Channel. Article wonders
aloud if it's all just becoming too commercial. Surely not. Being
on TV has nothing to do with making money, does it? Also includes a
nicely done piece that suggests leaving behind all your techno

   The libertarian magazine goes after _ surprise! _ Bill Clinton
this month, noting that he's survived scandals not because he's

program for surviving endless scandal,'' noting that Clinton
doesn't feed scandals and uses his office to distract the public,
mostly by having the military blow something up.
</P>
<P>
   There's another piece on agronomist extraordinaire Norman
Borlaug, the father of the so-called Green Revolution and a Nobel
Peace Prize winner, who is still teaching at Texas A&AMP;M at age 86.
Borlaug is widely credited with increasing wheat yields in the late
1960s and saving millions from starvation in Mexico, India and
Pakistan. There also is a good piece noting that this year's
presidential election will be less about issues than any election,
ever. &QL;

WATCH OUT, WISEGUY, ONE FALSE NOTE... 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Love those Sopranos? Well, here come the countertenors, the
whining gangsters who strut through ``Falcone,'' the series that
begins Tuesday night on CBS. Like many of the journeymen crooks who
fleetingly pass through it, this earnest drama is trying to live by
the rules. And like those mobsters, it's being set up. It's gonna
get whacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' is bound to fall short in the inevitable comparisons
to ``The Sopranos,'' the groundbreaking HBO series, and to ``Donnie
Brasco,'' the 1997 film that shares its source material with
``Falcone.'' Nor is it well served by CBS' bombardment-style
introduction: two episodes Tuesday night and seven more over the
next eight nights (with Sunday off for good behavior).
</P>
<P>
   This is not ``Millionaire''-style soda pop for the millions to
guzzle night after night. It's a dark but strangely sanitized brew,
a decaf espresso, better sipped in small quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Gedrick stars as Joe Pistone, which is the real name of a
former FBI agent whose memoirs of infiltrating the Mafia inspired
first the film and now this series. When encountered Tuesday night,
the fictionalized Pistone, using the name Joe Falcone, has been
accepted by a mob family in New York. He's spending far too little
time with his real family: his wife, Maggie, and two daughters in
New Jersey. When he does slip away to visit them, the reunion can
be bumpy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks!'' rails Maggie (Amy Carlson) in a scene meant to
establish the toll all this takes on her. ``Two weeks you been gone
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was workin', Maggs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I can't tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts might worry her. They'd certainly confuse her. And
maybe you, too. Joe is watching from the inside as a couple of
third-string capos vie for power. Joe had better side with the
right one, otherwise he'll get whacked. (This is the word heard
most in this show.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes down t'choosin', I'll go wit' my instincts,''
Joe tells his FBI boss, Jules Weller (Robert John Burke). Joe does
choose correctly, and he becomes a trusted underling of the
triumphant Sonny Napoli (Titus Welliver). Thus Joe is given orders
by two glum middle managers, both of whom try to be as fair as
their inflexible codes allow. But like other promising elements in
the show, this one isn't explored.
</P>
<P>
   This series pulls its punches. Of course it must conform to the
requirements of broadcast television, so the language never
descends further than an occasional grade-school epithet. (Words
can still be offensive, however, as in the third episode, when a
black police detective looks down upon the body of a whacked
mobster and snarls an anti-Italian slur.)
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no sex here; in one scene set in a strip club,
the women writhing onstage display as much skin as your average
basketball player. Yes, plenty of whacking is depicted. Plenty. But
it's curiously bloodless. Besides deaths by shooting, stabbing and
strangling, Tuesday night's two hours offer a toe broken with
pliers and two scenes of faces shoved into hot food (pizza and chop
suey).
</P>
<P>
   Nobody cusses, nobody copulates, nobody sweats, and hardly
anybody bleeds. The only dramatic tension surrounds the question of
whether Joe's true identity will be discovered. But in that case,
he'd be whacked, and the show would be over.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves characterization to carry the day. Some of the
peripheral figures are winningly quirky. And Gedrick might be able
to charm the audience if given a chance. He gives great close-up.
In a moment that supplies one of the series' infrequent grace
notes, Joe gets home long enough to tell his girls a bedtime story,
his own version of the legend of Ulysses, another good guy who was
away from the house a lot. ``Tomorrow night,'' he tells them, ``the
suitors get whacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers from New Jersey, grumpy over the depiction of their
state on ``The Sopranos'' as a hotbed of crime (not to mention hot
beds), may take a grain of comfort from ``Falcone.'' Here the crime
is all on the New York side of the Hudson; when Joe crosses to the
west side of the river, he enters the oasis of normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those viewers may also catch an inside joke, an
appearance by Floyd Vivino, the clown prince of New Jersey cable.
He convincingly plays a character called Rocky TV, an apt
description of his eternal turn as Uncle Floyd. But any happiness
over the sight of Vivino without his oversize bow tie and
madras-plaid porkpie hat is quickly dashed: Rocky gets whacked.

 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books: &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE OPERATOR'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Tom King (Random House, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This biography of producer and record industry mogul David
Geffen is interesting on two levels. First, there is King's
portrayal of Geffen as a man of ratlike cunning, a dealmaker with a
voracious lust for money and power. Even more interesting is
Geffen's involvement with celebrities of the past three decades,
whose professional and personal lives he directed with both
tyrannical self-interest and the concern of a doting den mother. He
was engaged to Cher until she dumped him for Gregg Allman. ``I want
all my presents back!'' Geffen shouted and then went into a deep
depression, which he conquered by attending ``est'' seminars and
facing up to his homosexuality. He was arrested for buying drugs
for David Crosby, and he comforted Yoko Ono at the hospital after
John Lennon died. His friends included Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and
Jackson Browne, and he was once rumored to have secretly married
Keanu Reeves. He even counseled the president and first lady after
the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke _ there is no end to his
territory. King is a reporter for the ``Wall Street Journal.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``SEEING MARY PLAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Frances Kiernan (Norton, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a word for Mary McCarthy, and it isn't pretty. Today,
more than a decade after her death, she is known for her
controversial meanspiritedness far more than for her fiction or
criticism. As Kiernan says in this honest and oddly affectionate
biography, if she had never written a single word, we would still
want to know about her. She was outspoken, sarcastic, beautiful and
intimidating, a writer who held strong views on many subjects and
did not suffer fools gladly. She is most widely known, perhaps, for
the remark she made about Lillian Hellman in a televised interview
with Dick Cavett in 1980: ``Every word she writes,'' McCarthy said,
`is a lie, including `and' and `the.' '' Hellman sued but McCarthy
refused to back down, even when the lawsuit threatened to bankrupt
her. Kiernan, a former editor at the ``New Yorker,'' conducted
interviews with McCarthy's friends, former lovers, colleagues and
acquaintances, some of whom reveal lingering distaste for a woman
who was capable, as Clifton Fadiman once wrote, ``of dissecting
people and leaving a nasty mess on the table.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``JOAN OF ARC'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Mary Gordon (Viking, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The delight of the ``Penguin Lives'' series of short biographies
is the pairing of author and subject, and the brevity of the
effort. These ``biographies'' rarely reach 200 pages, and because
of it they take on a decidedly personal tone _ we sense the
writer's pleasure in what he or she is writing about, and it
becomes part of our pleasure as well. Past or planned installments
include Larry McMurtry writing on Crazy Horse, Jonathan Spence on
Mao Tse-tung, Edna O'Brien on James Joyce, Bobbie Ann Mason on
Elvis Presley, and Roy Blount Jr. on Robert E. Lee. Now we have
Mary Gordon, whose writing is steeped in her experience of Roman
Catholicism, pondering the shocking and much-manipulated story of
the French girl-soldier who at 17 left her village to lead an army
and two years later died in agony. Joan was not perfect, and Gordon
addresses her sins as well as her sainthood. She is not so much the
patroness of France, writes Gordon, as ``the patroness of the vivid
life, prized not for military victories but for the gift of
passionate action taken against ridiculous odds, for the grace of
holding nothing back.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CYBILL DISOBEDIENCE'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Cybill Shepherd (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd has written a memoir about her sex life, and she has
dedicated it to her parents. OK, we exaggerate _ only half of it is
about her sex life (including a romp with Elvis Presley _ you'll
want to read that part). Maybe she's hoping her parents won't
notice. Still, once you get past its unfortunate title and
prologue, this is an engaging book. Shepherd is smart. She says she
reads Henry James and Joseph Conrad and is inspired by Goethe. She
might be making that up, but she uses the word ``flummoxed''
correctly and with a straight face, and we think she means it. She
is funny and self-deprecating in much the same way that Candice
Bergen was in her better-than-average memoir, ``Knock Wood.''
Shepherd talks about her family, career, marriages and lovers,
leading men (Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis), aging and its
ramifications for an actress (``It's OK for Robert Mitchum to get
up early in the morning and look like Robert Mitchum, but it was
not OK for me to wake up in the morning and look like Robert
Mitchum . . .''). She's not Goethe, but there's more to her than
meets the eye.  &QL;

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is almost
certain to rule Microsoft violated federal antitrust law. The big
shoe to fall will be the penalty stage of the ruling that won't
come any earlier than this summer. Appeals could last years. A look
at what those penalities could be and what the tactics of both
sides, the government and Microsoft, are likely to be during this
period. It's predictable that Microsoft will try to put a PR spin
on the event and that'll be included too. (Glass, Cox News

   &UR; Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books: &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE OPERATOR'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Tom King (Random House, $25.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This biography of producer and record industry mogul David
Geffen is interesting on two levels. First, there is King's
portrayal of Geffen as a man of ratlike cunning, a dealmaker with a
voracious lust for money and power. Even more interesting is
Geffen's involvement with celebrities of the past three decades,
whose professional and personal lives he directed with both
tyrannical self-interest and the concern of a doting den mother. He
was engaged to Cher until she dumped him for Gregg Allman. ``I want
all my presents back!'' Geffen shouted and then went into a deep
depression, which he conquered by attending ``est'' seminars and
facing up to his homosexuality. He was arrested for buying drugs
for David Crosby, and he comforted Yoko Ono at the hospital after
John Lennon died. His friends included Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and
Jackson Browne, and he was once rumored to have secretly married
Keanu Reeves. He even counseled the president and first lady after
the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke _ there is no end to his
territory. King is a reporter for the ``Wall Street Journal.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``SEEING MARY PLAIN'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Frances Kiernan (Norton, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a word for Mary McCarthy, and it isn't pretty. Today,
more than a decade after her death, she is known for her
controversial meanspiritedness far more than for her fiction or
criticism. As Kiernan says in this honest and oddly affectionate
biography, if she had never written a single word, we would still
want to know about her. She was outspoken, sarcastic, beautiful and
intimidating, a writer who held strong views on many subjects and
did not suffer fools gladly. She is most widely known, perhaps, for
the remark she made about Lillian Hellman in a televised interview
with Dick Cavett in 1980: ``Every word she writes,'' McCarthy said,
`is a lie, including `and' and `the.' '' Hellman sued but McCarthy
refused to back down, even when the lawsuit threatened to bankrupt
her. Kiernan, a former editor at the ``New Yorker,'' conducted
interviews with McCarthy's friends, former lovers, colleagues and
acquaintances, some of whom reveal lingering distaste for a woman
who was capable, as Clifton Fadiman once wrote, ``of dissecting
people and leaving a nasty mess on the table.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``JOAN OF ARC'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Mary Gordon (Viking, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The delight of the ``Penguin Lives'' series of short biographies
is the pairing of author and subject, and the brevity of the
effort. These ``biographies'' rarely reach 200 pages, and because
of it they take on a decidedly personal tone _ we sense the
writer's pleasure in what he or she is writing about, and it
becomes part of our pleasure as well. Past or planned installments
include Larry McMurtry writing on Crazy Horse, Jonathan Spence on
Mao Tse-tung, Edna O'Brien on James Joyce, Bobbie Ann Mason on
Elvis Presley, and Roy Blount Jr. on Robert E. Lee. Now we have
Mary Gordon, whose writing is steeped in her experience of Roman
Catholicism, pondering the shocking and much-manipulated story of
the French girl-soldier who at 17 left her village to lead an army
and two years later died in agony. Joan was not perfect, and Gordon
addresses her sins as well as her sainthood. She is not so much the
patroness of France, writes Gordon, as ``the patroness of the vivid
life, prized not for military victories but for the gift of
passionate action taken against ridiculous odds, for the grace of
holding nothing back.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CYBILL DISOBEDIENCE'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Cybill Shepherd (HarperCollins, $26) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd has written a memoir about her sex life, and she has
dedicated it to her parents. OK, we exaggerate _ only half of it is

 Review of: 
 
 ``AMERICAN DREAMER: THE ART OF PHILIP C. CURTIS'' 
 Hudson Hills Press ($45) 
 
 
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considering the longevity of Philip Curtis' distinguished career
as a painter, it is surprising that only now has the first
full-length book of the artist's work been published.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``American Dreamer: The Art of Philip C. Curtis,'' the
book is a rich coffee-table compendium of the artist's work, filled
out with a series of essays by art critics and historians about the
Scottsdale resident.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly worth the price for the reproductions, which
cover Curtis' career from 1937 to the present, beginning with the
early New York social paintings and abstractions.
</P>
<P>
   The essays are less of a gift. They offer the occasional
insight, but mainly they pad the volume with endless jargon and
obscurantist palaver. It is a tough read and you come out the back
end without feeling a sense of either enlightenment or enjoyment.
This is not a book of graceful prose.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is little to illuminate the life and
personality of Curtis, who is a wonderfully interesting man, with a
wry sense of wit that can cut through the BS like a scalpel. He
once told me, ``Yes, I'm happy, but not so happy that I'm an idiot
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been helpful to have at least one essay that would
serve as a biography or at least a snapshot of the man's
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, each essay dives headfirst into the list of ``isms''
and influences that make up an art historian's narrow worldview.
Several of the essays repeat the same information, almost word for
word, as if there had been no editor to keep track of the
redundancies and weed them out.
</P>
<P>
   And the verbiage reaches a climax in the essay by Susan Ehrlich,
``Invocations of Wonder Transfixed in Time,'' in which the author's
love of Roget outmans her and wrestles her to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis' work, she writes, ``bears filiations with the cryptic
illusions of Belgian Surrealists.''
</P>
<P>
   And she tells us ``suspense accrues from the enfilade of
sequestered rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   And a door ``leads to secluded recessions (that) can signify
psychological travel through shrouded corridors of the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   This stuff is thick.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on: ``Certainly Curtis over the years has juggled
antitheses, clothing complex issues in simple attire, treating
prosaic forms in a Surreal way, and imposing a rationcinative order
on ideation's fugitive wraiths.''
</P>
<P>
   The horror. The horror.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of these essays, we are given a tour of the alleged
influences on Curtis, and how you can spot Matisse here, or Helen
Lundeberg there, as if such observations meant anything.
</P>
<P>
   There is some relief in the longish final essay by Harry Rand.
It is not gracefully written, either, but it does offer some
insight into the sophistication of Curtis' mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even Rand can lob out a line like: ``He was not alone in
eschewing a reductionist telos of Abstract Expressionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a one of them seems to understand Curtis with the clarity of
``Time'' magazine founder Henry Luce, who once wrote that
``Curtis's people are clearly all `waiting for Godot.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He hits a simple truth of the art that all the righteous
scholarship of the art historians seems blind to in the verbal
blizzard of their glossolalia. &QL;

 &HT;    General Electric retains top spot on Forbes list
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ General Electric tops the Forbes (April 17) list of
best-performing companies for the third straight year, with 1999
sales of $111.63 billion, a net profit of $10.7 billion and a
market value (share price times shares outstanding) of more than
$80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``By every yardstick, 1999 was a remarkable year of growth for
America's largest corporations,'' says Forbes. ``You'd have to go
back to 1994 to find a better year (for profits).''
</P>
<P>
   Total sales for companies on the magazine's 32nd annual Forbes
500 list rose 11 percent to $6.5 trillion. Profits rose 26 percent
to $440 billion, assets rose 13 percent to $16.8 trillion and
market value rose 25 percent to $14 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes ranks U.S. companies according to sales, profit, assets
and market value. That means its rankings are usually different
from the Fortune 500, which ranks companies by revenue. General
Motors, with 1999 sales of $189.1 billion, topped Fortune's list,
which was released over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Just behind General Electric on Forbes' list are Citigroup,
Exxon Mobil, Bank of America and IBM. The highest-ranking
Georgia-based company is BellSouth, at 30th place.
</P>
<P>
   A SALTY BEVERAGE COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   By dominating the salty-snack market, Pepsico has become leaner
and more profitable, Business Week (April 10) says in a cover
profile of Coca-Cola's biggest competitor. The credit goes to Roger
A. Enrico, a 29-year Pepsico veteran who became chief executive in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dramatic change at Pepsi is that soda and juice run a
distant second to the big engine that now drives Pepsico:
(Frito-Lay) snack foods, in which the company enjoys near-total
dominance,'' the magazine says. ``Pepsi-Cola is still second to
Coca-Cola, but last fall Pepsi's Mountain Dew edged out Diet Coke
for third place.''
</P>
<P>
   Enrico's challenge, says Business Week, is to do for Pepsi's
lagging stock what he has done for the company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH MENTIONING ...
</P>
<P>
   _ The Internet is here to stay, but many investors aren't sure
about some of the companies that inhabit it, says Kiplinger's
Personal Finance (April 11), which identifies companies and mutual
funds its analysts believe will grow.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inc. (April), a small-business magazine, looks at ways
enterprising companies can raise money without automatically taking
a trip ``down the much-vaunted venture-capital/IPO route.'' Among
the alternatives are local banks and online investors.

TEXAS TRIED CAMPAIGN REFORM AND FAILED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Judging from my e-mail, I haven't been able to
convince everyone of the need to improve campaign finance laws. But
we can all enjoy the spectacle of our two major presidential
candidates trying to carry the ``reform'' banner.
</P>
<P>
   Any ``reform'' effort obviously will be difficult, and it will
be complicated by the superrich people who can afford to fund their
own campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature once tried to ``even the playing field'' _
as the cliche goes _ between wealthy and nonwealthy candidates. The
law didn't work, but the exercise is worth recounting because it
shows how laws can be ambushed.
</P>
<P>
   The effort stemmed from the 1990 gubernatorial race, in which
Democrat Ann Richards beat Republican Clayton Williams in a
hard-fought campaign. Williams, a West Texas businessman, spent
millions of his own dollars and may have won if he hadn't
repeatedly shot himself in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Among other gaffes, he told several reporters an insensitive
joke about rape, prompting much public outrage. And, further
endearing himself to taxpayers only a few days before the election,
he admitted publicly that he hadn't paid any federal income taxes a
few years earlier because of business losses.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 election occurred as the Legislature was getting a lot
of bad publicity about large lobby expenditures and large ethical
lapses. So there was a major effort in the 1991 legislative session
to enact an ``ethics reform'' law covering special interests'
influences on elections and the lawmaking process.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, who had battled Williams' wealth with some large
campaign contributions from supporters, urged lawmakers to limit
political donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think small,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't say how small, but presumably she meant something
smaller than the $350,000 in contributions and loans she had
received from her biggest money source _ Beaumont trial lawyer
Walter Umphrey and his law firm's political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Richards also asked the Legislature to ``temper the influence of
personal wealth in campaigns'' by limiting the amount of political
contributions wealthy candidates could use to repay themselves for
their personal expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bill Clements largely funded his own first successful
race for governor in 1978 but, after taking office, raised enough
money to repay himself from contributors eager to mend fences. Had
he won in 1990, Williams would have been able to do the same thing,
and Richards didn't think that was fair.
</P>
<P>
   Although wealth alone obviously isn't enough to win a
presidential race, as Steve Forbes and Ross Perot have recently
proved, it can be a significant factor in local and statewide
races. And the U.S. Supreme Court, while upholding limits on how
much money a candidate can raise from other people, has ruled that
lawmakers can't limit how much a candidate may spend to get
elected.
</P>
<P>
   So Richards proposed _ and the 1991 Legislature enacted _ an
indirect attack on a candidate's wealth. Lawmakers didn't limit
contributions from special interest groups and other sources, but
they restricted gubernatorial candidates' ability to repay
themselves from campaign donations to $500,000 per election. Other
statewide officeholders were given a $250,000 limit.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics law also imposed some additional lobby reporting
requirements, but, overall, it was pretty weak. It also created the
Texas Ethics Commission to advise state officials and candidates on
do's and don'ts and, occasionally, point out loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, answering a question from a judicial candidate,
the commission found a dandy loophole for the rich. It said the
payback limits didn't apply if a candidate, instead of spending his
own money outright, used his wealth to guarantee bank loans for his
campaign. The candidate could then raise as much money as necessary
to repay the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaire David Dewhurst, who borrowed more than $3 million to
win the land commissioner's office in 1998, could use that
loophole. He hasn't repaid his loans yet, but maybe that's because
land commissioners can't raise money as fast as governors and
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   One legislator filed a bill last year to close the loophole, but
it went nowhere. That kind of ``reform'' apparently isn't in style
with most lawmakers anymore.

 &HT;    OLDER WORKERS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO REMAIN, PANEL TOLD
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government and businesses should assist senior
citizens who want to continue working beyond 65, a Senate panel was
told Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Skill training for older workers is not the norm, and senior
citizens in the work force remain under-represented in company
training programs, said Joseph Perkins, president of AARP.
</P>
<P>
   The best way employers could encourage older workers to remain
or re-enter the labor force is to provide appealing part-time
employment opportunities and ``phased retirement,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Phased retirement allows employees to gradually reduce their
work week as they approach retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``With unemployment at record lows and the need for highly
skilled and competent workers at record highs, employers will have
to re-think their attitudes about older workers as well as their
labor practices if they want to encourage good workers to stay on
the job longer or re-enter the marketplace,'' Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens who can only work part-time should receive
pensions and private saving plans such as 401(k)'s, said Sen. Chuck
Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on
Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the labor pool shrinks, and as baby boomers age, we'll see
more creative ways to keep older employees then ever before,'' he
said. ``Customizing retirement arrangements and flexible scheduling
will be the norm. Congress has to respond in kind. We have to make
sure federal laws don't hurt older workers. Our economy depends on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans don't have enough money to retire and have to
work until they are older, the senator added. With that in mind,
Congress should pass laws that encourage retirement savings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last week voted 422-0 to repeal the Social Security
earnings test, which reduces benefits for workers age 65 through
69. The Senior Citizen Freedom to Work Act is awaiting the
signature of President Clinton, who has promised to approve it. The
law will take effect retroactive to Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repealing the earnings limit was a good start. Next, we have
to help employers accommodate the needs of older workers,''
Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins noted that baby boomers are living longer, healthier
lives, are better educated than their parents, and are used to
having more options with regarding their work and leisure.
</P>
<P>
   A recent AARP study found that older workers continue to be
recognized and valued for having a good work ethic and providing
experience, knowledge and stability in the workplace, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the study's findings, many businesses try to
eliminate their older workers by offering lucrative retirement
packages when they are 62, or by imposing subtle forms of
discrimination.

&HT;     AAA AFFILIATE SEES BIG DEMAND FOR AUTO SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUSTINO AGUILA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The concept may seem far-fetched: You're
drinking a mocha and surfing the Internet with your laptop, while
your kids play nearby and somebody changes the oil in your car.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the California State Automobile Association is
offering as it steps into the auto repair business with a chain of
shops catering to everyone from Gen X-ers to parents of young
children to anyone with a high-tech lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've gotten so much accomplished,'' said Barbara
Motton-Sims, who recently visited AAA Car Care Plus in Santa Clara.
``In one stop, I had lunch, had time to finish my Easter cards and
had my car checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   CSAA, the second largest AAA affiliate in the nation with 4
million members and membership revenue approaching $20 million, has
quietly ventured into the car repair business after surveys
indicated its members wanted more than diagnostic clinics and
referrals to AAA-approved garages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to get your car fixed is like going to the dentist,''
said Mark Woods, general manager for CSAA's auto repair line.
``It's not something that's pleasant, but we're trying to change
that here when people bring their cars in.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, CSAA has only the pilot location in Santa Clara. It
opened in February 1999 and serves people from San Jose and
surrounding areas. Another site is under construction in Sacramento
and will open this summer.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 more CSAA garages are being planned in the next four
years in the club's Northern California territory, which extends to
some parts of Nevada and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here for maps and tour books,'' said Pradeep Saraswat,
45, as he munched on a banana nut muffin in the clean,
air-conditioned cafe next to the repair garage. ``My car needed a
25,000-mile service.''
</P>
<P>
   After the facility opened, Saraswat visited the nearby AAA
membership offices and wondered what the new garage was all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealers tend to talk you into getting things for your car that
you don't want,`` the Fremont resident said. ``I think AAA won't do
that. The services are also 15 to 20 percent cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Value and quality are what CSAA is aiming for, especially since
many people already trust the brand name, Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can still get evaluations on their vehicles' needs and
select from a menu of minor to major vehicle repairs, smog checks
and oil changes. They also can get their cars washed and detailed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high demand for auto service, David Whitgob,
chief operating officer of the local affiliate's automotive
operation, doesn't think the new repair chain will affect business
at other repair shops.
</P>
<P>
   When the Santa Clara site opened, CSAA estimated it would
service 35 vehicles a day, but the number jumped to more than 50
with the average driver spending about $100 per visit, Whitgob
said.
</P>
<P>
   The repair shop is usually booked 4 1/2 weeks in advance,
leaving some drivers to look elsewhere. Those who can't be helped
at the site can be referred to AAA-approved garages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even then, people will wait,'' Whitgob said. ``They trust the
AAA brand.''

COLLEGE FINANCING MAY BE NEGOTIABLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SHANNON BUGGS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The majority of the nation's high school seniors find
out this week if the colleges they want to attend want them to
enroll.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the time when they and their parents are told just how
much a higher education sojourn will cost them.
</P>
<P>
   Average college tuition has more than doubled in the past two
decades, while median incomes for families with college-age
children has risen only 22 percent, according to The College Board,
which administers the SAT college entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
   During the last school year, $64 billion in financial aid was
distributed nationally, with about 58 percent of it in student
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The increased availability of federal and state education loans
gives many more students the opportunity to attend college. But it
also saddles graduates with debt loads that are often difficult to
manage and pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Before accepting any admissions offers, students should
carefully consider the full financial ramifications of their
college choice.
</P>
<P>
   Students with aspirations of attending law, medical or business
school need to think twice about taking on a lot of debt in their
undergraduate years, because much of their graduate education will
be financed with loans.
</P>
<P>
   Those who plan to pursue fulfilling careers in low-paying
professions, such as education, social services or journalism, also
may have to worry about making enough to keep up with their loan
payments after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   So before you commit to a school, negotiate for the best
financial aid package you can get. Here are some tips on how to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Apply for aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person that I could tell you with absolute assurance
that is not eligible for financial aid is the person who does not
apply,'' says Robert Sheridan, director of scholarships and
financial aid at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   April 1 is the annual priority deadline for mailing in the Free
Application for Federal Student Aid that all colleges require
students seeking aid to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Those who missed it can still apply for financial aid, but the
chances of getting a federal grant to pay for school this year have
declined significantly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Calculate the costs.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost certain no two financial aid offers will look the
same. So, pay close attention to how much in grants and
scholarships the school is giving you vs. how much money you will
have to earn or borrow. The goal, of course, is to get as much free
money as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Also, find out if outside scholarships are used to reduce the
amount the student and family must contribute or if the money will
be used to lessen the school's grant amount.
</P>
<P>
   To help with your dollar and cents breakdown, use the calculator
at www.collegeboard.org.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make a case in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Outline where the shortfalls are. For example, the estimated
transportation budget may not cover a roundtrip airline ticket home
for winter break or the true cost of filling your tank for the
daily commute to school.
</P>
<P>
   You may also want to include better offers from comparable
schools with a note stating your preference for the school you are
negotiating with and your concerns that you will not be able to
afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Present all this information in person or by fax or e-mail and
follow up with phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think just saying you're not good at managing money is
enough to get a change made,'' says Ann Wright, vice president for
enrollment at Rice University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And complaining about sticker shock also won't get you more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges consider making adjustments in aid package if something
has happened that significantly alters a family's finances.
Setbacks usually considered are illness, divorce and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges also realize that the federal financial aid form cannot
capture everything relevant to your family's finances. So, inform
your aid officer of any ongoing situations, like caring for an
elderly relative or paying off medical bills, that strain your
family's income.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask, don't demand.
</P>
<P>
   Financial aid maneuvering is not the same as hiring
negotiations. You are not in the position of power in this
situation _ the school is. So, don't make threats or demands.
Polite and diplomatic behavior will get you closer to what you
want.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, most public universities offer the best aid package
they can in the beginning and don't dicker. Many private schools
also have limits on what they will do. But it never hurts to ask.

   The first mummy, it is said, was the Egyptian god Osiris _
brother and husband of Isis. And the last mummy, it may someday be
said, is a man who died in Baltimore in 1994 of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The latter left this life in his 70s. By now, his mummifiers
imagine, this man has already approached Osiris and been deemed
worthy.
</P>
<P>
   One of his mummifiers is Ronn Wade, director of the Maryland
State Anatomy Board and director of the Anatomical Service Division
of the University of Maryland. He is in charge of finding and
allotting to medical schools the bodies of those who donate
themselves to science.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years ago, these quarters opened a small window
onto the funerary practices of the ancient Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the family it was a `long-term' research project,''
Wade says. ``They don't know that Dad's a mummy, but from my point
of view, we treated him like a king.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Wade was contacted by the classical scholar Bob Brier,
a professor of philosophy and Egyptology at the C.W. Post campus of
Long Island University in New York. After years of studying
hieroglyphs and investigating tombs, Brier had decided that his
research would not be complete until he mummified a human body. The
problem: where to get the body.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague put him in touch with Wade, who agreed to help. They
became partners in a plot to re-create ancient Egyptian techniques
of body preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Wade and Brier waited months for the perfect subject _ someone
who was relatively healthy and physically intact. Finally, the
ideal candidate arrived: a 187-pound man in his 70s, dead after a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Following 2,000-year-old descriptions of mummifying techniques
and using only replicas of ancient tools, Wade and Brier
transformed the body into an Egyptian-style mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics say the team's project was frivolous, both men
insist their purpose was to understand _ in real time _ how and why
certain procedures were accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was not a mummy,'' Brier says sternly. ``The goal was
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brier and Wade were determined to answer nagging questions
regarding Egyptian mummification. Why did it take 70 days, as Greek
historians Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus claimed? How did they
remove the organs and minimize injury to the body's exterior? How
was the brain removed?
</P>
<P>
   Removing the brain, Brier emphasizes, was the critical step _
and it proved a challenge. Herodotus had described taking clumps of
brain tissue out by hooking it on the end of a metal tool and
lifting it out one chunk at a time. But Wade and Brier found that
brain tissue wasn't dense enough to hold together for that kind of
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tissue just doesn't adhere to the tool,'' Brier says. ``We
had to put the hook in and rotate it like a whisk.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed to thread the whisk up the nostril and through the
olfactory tract to get it into the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did figure the whisking out, the brain tissue poured
out pink, with a little blood, like a strawberry milk shake,''
Brier says.
</P>
<P>
   To cleanse the skull, they wound linen strips on the end of the
hook and swabbed out excess tissue and moisture. Then they packed
the skull with linen rubbed with frankincense _ one of the seven
sacred substances the ancient mummifiers used. The other sacred
substances known are myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to extract and preserve the internal organs.
(The brain, considered unimportant, was discarded.) Because ancient
Egyptians believed that the dead would use their bodies in the next
life, minimizing damage to the exterior was crucial. The organs had
to be removed through a small, three-inch cut in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Herodotus, the first incision was made with a sharp
``Ethiopian stone.'' Brier took the term to mean obsidian _ a
glassy black volcanic rock that can be flaked to a razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obsidian is sharper and thinner than any surgeon's scalpel,''
Brier says. ``Inside the body we used bronze and copper knives, but
obsidian was definitely meant for making the first slit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade, the designated surgeon, then reached into the slit with a
small copper knife firmly wedged between his first and second
fingers so that only a few centimeters of blade peeked out. The
first organs removed, Wade recalls, were the upper intestinal tract
and the pancreas. Next were the spleen, kidneys, bladder and more
of the digestive tract. The intestines, colon, stomach, liver and
lungs followed.
</P>
<P>
   The heart _ considered the nexus of thought and soul by ancient
Egyptians _ was left in the rib cage. When the deceased approached
Osiris in the afterlife, his heart would be weighed. If it was as
light as the feather of Maat, the goddess of truth, the person was
a step closer to being accepted by the gods.
</P>
<P>
   As a final touch, 29 linen-wrapped packets of natron were tucked
inside the body. In addition to collecting water, hastening
desiccation and absorbing foul odors, the packets helped preserve
the natural contours of the body for its resurrection in the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wade and Brier placed the body on a wooden platform covered
with natron and heaped more natron upon it. The organs were placed
on ceramic platters nearby. They, too, were covered with natron.
</P>
<P>
   Just as salts will preserve and dry meats, the natron _ 580
pounds of it _ would draw out the body's moisture and render the
dried flesh impervious to bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The platform holding the body and the other organs was put into
an embalming preparation room in the basement of Wade's department
and left at 90 to 107 degrees Fahrenheit. Two dehumidifiers working
around the clock for 35 days would re-create the dry desert
conditions of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   At midday of the 35th day, Wade and Brier opened the room
containing the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natron was wet,'' Wade remembers. ``It smelled like wet
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The white, sandy compound had clumped on top of the body and
become stiff from the fluids it had absorbed. The body, originally
156 pounds with its organs removed, ``now weighed 79 pounds,'' Wade
said. ``He lost 77 pounds of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to remove the natron packets through the initial
cut. ``The incision had been drawn tight by the body's shrinking,''
Wade says. ``I could barely get my hand in it.'' Brier and Wade
managed to get out all but a few.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Wade and Brier began the beautification process.
First they rubbed the skin with linen strips that had been soaked
in oil containing frankincense, myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
Then they wrapped the body with linen strips, securing it with dabs
of lacquer made of cedar resin.
</P>
<P>
   According to ancient texts, the body was supposed to be kept
under natron for 35 days, and then kept around, exposed, for
another 35 _ perhaps for a period of mourning or other religious
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Brier and Wade departed from Egyptian tradition
and waited 140 days to make the final preparations. The body had
lost more moisture. It now weighed about 70 pounds. This was the
day to complete its linen shroud and inscribe the cloth with
appropriate prayers. Each finger, toe and limb was wrapped
individually, and as each was done, Brier recited a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mummy rests three doors down from Wade's office. It has
been admired by museum-goers and coveted by Egyptologists as a
control for analyzing the physical conditions of ancient mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic archaeologists can already determine if the person
mummified had parasites, arthritis, or sometimes, bacterial
disease. Now that they know what mummification does to the body's
tissues, they can extrapolate with more accuracy the health
conditions of ancients who were mummified.
</P>
<P>
   If Brier uttered the proper prayers as the final wrappings were
applied, the Egypt of the afterlife may have a new, unexpected
citizen. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The world's first bowling robot hunkers down in an alley in
Muskegon, Mich., plotting its next strike. Ten feet high and 20
feet long, with an arm the size of a howitzer and springs like
rocket launchers, Throbot weighs more than 8 tons. Stored in its
Pentium-powered brain are tens of thousands of throws by dozens of
human bowlers, their exact spin, velocity and position recorded by
video cameras, ultrasonic and infrared sensors, and a
computer-aided tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' says Bill Orlikowski, a professional
bowler whose throws the machine often imitates. ``I sit behind it
and get the same feeling as when I'm bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarier still, to the average weekend player, may be the sheer
scientific sophistication of modern bowling. Professional bowling
now requires space-age equipment _ urethane balls, plastic-coated
pins, lanes laser-inspected for smoothness _ and true success is
measured in thousandths of inches.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting strikes, of course, is slamming the ball into
the ``pocket'' _ for right-handers, the space between the first pin
and the one angled behind it to the right.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. A ball that hits the pocket
straight on will deflect away from the pins, rather than
ricocheting through the pyramid. To knock down every pin, it should
hit the pocket after veering six degrees from its original path,
says Roger Dalkin, executive director of the American Bowling
congress. ``But you have to hit a target 1 inch wide that's 60 feet
away, and more hook equals less accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where science and technology can help. Beneath a bowling
ball's urethane shell lies a dense core of polyester infused with
calcium carbonate or barium sulfate. This structure lowers a ball's
inertia by concentrating its weight in the center, thus helping the
ball to roll faster and more easily.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly off-center, irregularly shaped core also lends itself
to sidespin, which makes a ball curve down the lane. To see what
works best, bowling engineers use computers to model balls. When a
prototype is ready at the Brunswick Bowling research center in
Muskegon, Throbot gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Bill Wasserberger, Brunswick's director of
high-performance bowling-ball research and development, placed one
of his creations into Throbot's paw _ a U-shaped chuck, set at a
10-degree angle _ and set it spinning. When the ball reached 300
revolutions per minute (the forward rotation an average bowler can
achieve), the giant arm swung back, locked with a thunk and then
slowly tightened its springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solid professional bowler has about an inch and a half
variation five feet down the lane,'' Wasserberger said. ``Throbot
has between two- and four-tenths of an inch.'' By the time the arm
hurtled forward and the ball blasted out at a programmed height and
angle, a strike seemed preordained. Yet even Throbot can't control
every variable.
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain a ball's speed, bowling lanes are usually
coated in mineral oil once or twice a day, Wasserberger explained.
In a typical bowling alley, the edges of the lane are lightly
oiled, and the last 20 feet are left dry. That way, a ball with
sidespin can better grip the lane, curving clear of the gutter and
hooking into the pocket at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But lane oil is hardly a constant. Alley owners can slather
their lanes with various types and quantities of it. Professional
lanes are coated with an even layer of oil across their entire
width, but they still suffer more from patchy distribution as balls
spread the oil around. Because a bowler can't see the oil pattern
from the top of the lane, his first toss is a blind trial. After
that, he can adjust his throw, try a different ball or, as a last
resort, sand or polish his original ball to alter its coefficient
of friction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get rid of some of the guesswork, Wasserberger's
engineers had given the ball he was testing an arrow-shaped core
and a shell made of a new kind of urethane called Proactive. The
core made the ball change its axis as it rolled, so a dry part of
the ball touched by the lane on every turn, thereby improving its
grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the ball gets to the back part of the lane, you
get an increase in hooking action,'' Wasserberger said. Whenever
the ball hit an especially oily patch, special particles in the
urethane shell (Wasserberger wouldn't reveal their composition)
increased the ball's traction.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the difference such small changes can make,
Wasserberger had Throbot try the exact same throw with a more
traditional ball. This time, it swung short of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there is no limit to how precise and powerful a
bowling ball could be made. But the American Bowling Congress and
the Women's International Bowling Congress keep a sharp eye on
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In one room at the congresses' joint testing center in
Greendale, Wis., 16-pound balls are weighed to make certain that
their balance isn't off-center by more than an ounce. In another
room, a ball rolls down a ramp and through an archway strung with
fiber-optic infrared sensors. When the ball hits a pin, both the
ball speed and the pin speed are measured to ensure that no more
than 35 percent of the ball's energy has been transferred to the
pin.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a ball on a conveyor belt continually climbs another
ramp and then knocks down sets of newly manufactured pins. If they
give higher or lower scores than regulations allow, they won't be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling lanes have their own strict specifications to meet: They
are not supposed to have dips, peaks or crosswise tilts of more
than 40-thousandths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But John Davis, president and chief engineer of the Kegel
Company in Sebring, Fla., thinks there is still room for
improvement. Forty-thousandths of an inch may be less than the
thickness of a quarter, he says, ``but that amount of tilt can
affect how a lane plays.''
</P>
<P>
   One machine Davis has designed scoots down a lane, stopping
every two feet to check the surface topography with a laser at 80
separate points across the boards. Another of his inventions uses
microprocessors and fluid measuring devices to apply as little as
one-thousandth of an ounce of oil to each board of the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it doesn't matter on the recreational level,'' Davis
says. ``But why wouldn't you want the same conditions as the
competitive level to compare yourself to the stars?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, success or failure lies in human hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the technology in the world,'' Wasserberger say, ``can't
help you if you stink.''

   The world's first bowling robot hunkers down in an alley in
Muskegon, Mich., plotting its next strike. Ten feet high and 20
feet long, with an arm the size of a howitzer and springs like
rocket launchers, Throbot weighs more than 8 tons. Stored in its
Pentium-powered brain are tens of thousands of throws by dozens of
human bowlers, their exact spin, velocity and position recorded by
video cameras, ultrasonic and infrared sensors, and a
computer-aided tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' says Bill Orlikowski, a professional
bowler whose throws the machine often imitates. ``I sit behind it
and get the same feeling as when I'm bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarier still, to the average weekend player, may be the sheer
scientific sophistication of modern bowling. Professional bowling
now requires space-age equipment _ urethane balls, plastic-coated
pins, lanes laser-inspected for smoothness _ and true success is
measured in thousandths of inches.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting strikes, of course, is slamming the ball into
the ``pocket'' _ for right-handers, the space between the first pin
and the one angled behind it to the right.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. A ball that hits the pocket
straight on will deflect away from the pins, rather than
ricocheting through the pyramid. To knock down every pin, it should
hit the pocket after veering six degrees from its original path,
says Roger Dalkin, executive director of the American Bowling
congress. ``But you have to hit a target 1 inch wide that's 60 feet
away, and more hook equals less accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where science and technology can help. Beneath a bowling
ball's urethane shell lies a dense core of polyester infused with
calcium carbonate or barium sulfate. This structure lowers a ball's
inertia by concentrating its weight in the center, thus helping the
ball to roll faster and more easily.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly off-center, irregularly shaped core also lends itself
to sidespin, which makes a ball curve down the lane. To see what
works best, bowling engineers use computers to model balls. When a
prototype is ready at the Brunswick Bowling research center in
Muskegon, Throbot gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Bill Wasserberger, Brunswick's director of
high-performance bowling-ball research and development, placed one
of his creations into Throbot's paw _ a U-shaped chuck, set at a
10-degree angle _ and set it spinning. When the ball reached 300
revolutions per minute (the forward rotation an average bowler can
achieve), the giant arm swung back, locked with a thunk and then
slowly tightened its springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solid professional bowler has about an inch and a half
variation five feet down the lane,'' Wasserberger said. ``Throbot
has between two- and four-tenths of an inch.'' By the time the arm
hurtled forward and the ball blasted out at a programmed height and
angle, a strike seemed preordained. Yet even Throbot can't control
every variable.
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain a ball's speed, bowling lanes are usually
coated in mineral oil once or twice a day, Wasserberger explained.
In a typical bowling alley, the edges of the lane are lightly
oiled, and the last 20 feet are left dry. That way, a ball with
sidespin can better grip the lane, curving clear of the gutter and
hooking into the pocket at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But lane oil is hardly a constant. Alley owners can slather
their lanes with various types and quantities of it. Professional
lanes are coated with an even layer of oil across their entire
width, but they still suffer more from patchy distribution as balls
spread the oil around. Because a bowler can't see the oil pattern
from the top of the lane, his first toss is a blind trial. After
that, he can adjust his throw, try a different ball or, as a last
resort, sand or polish his original ball to alter its coefficient
of friction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get rid of some of the guesswork, Wasserberger's
engineers had given the ball he was testing an arrow-shaped core
and a shell made of a new kind of urethane called Proactive. The
core made the ball change its axis as it rolled, so a dry part of
the ball touched by the lane on every turn, thereby improving its
grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the ball gets to the back part of the lane, you
get an increase in hooking action,'' Wasserberger said. Whenever
the ball hit an especially oily patch, special particles in the
urethane shell (Wasserberger wouldn't reveal their composition)
increased the ball's traction.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the difference such small changes can make,
Wasserberger had Throbot try the exact same throw with a more
traditional ball. This time, it swung short of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there is no limit to how precise and powerful a
bowling ball could be made. But the American Bowling Congress and
the Women's International Bowling Congress keep a sharp eye on
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In one room at the congresses' joint testing center in
Greendale, Wis., 16-pound balls are weighed to make certain that
their balance isn't off-center by more than an ounce. In another
room, a ball rolls down a ramp and through an archway strung with
fiber-optic infrared sensors. When the ball hits a pin, both the
ball speed and the pin speed are measured to ensure that no more
than 35 percent of the ball's energy has been transferred to the
pin.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a ball on a conveyor belt continually climbs another
ramp and then knocks down sets of newly manufactured pins. If they
give higher or lower scores than regulations allow, they won't be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling lanes have their own strict specifications to meet: They
are not supposed to have dips, peaks or crosswise tilts of more
than 40-thousandths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But John Davis, president and chief engineer of the Kegel
Company in Sebring, Fla., thinks there is still room for
improvement. Forty-thousandths of an inch may be less than the
thickness of a quarter, he says, ``but that amount of tilt can
affect how a lane plays.''
</P>
<P>
   One machine Davis has designed scoots down a lane, stopping
every two feet to check the surface topography with a laser at 80
separate points across the boards. Another of his inventions uses
microprocessors and fluid measuring devices to apply as little as
one-thousandth of an ounce of oil to each board of the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it doesn't matter on the recreational level,'' Davis
says. ``But why wouldn't you want the same conditions as the
competitive level to compare yourself to the stars?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, success or failure lies in human hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the technology in the world,'' Wasserberger say, ``can't
help you if you stink.''

<P>
   The first mummy, it is said, was the Egyptian god Osiris _
brother and husband of Isis. And the last mummy, it may someday be
said, is a man who died in Baltimore in 1994 of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The latter left this life in his 70s. By now, his mummifiers
imagine, this man has already approached Osiris and been deemed
worthy.
</P>
<P>
   One of his mummifiers is Ronn Wade, director of the Maryland
State Anatomy Board and director of the Anatomical Service Division
of the University of Maryland. He is in charge of finding and
allotting to medical schools the bodies of those who donate
themselves to science.
</P>
<P>
   More than five years ago, these quarters opened a small window
onto the funerary practices of the ancient Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the family it was a `long-term' research project,''
Wade says. ``They don't know that Dad's a mummy, but from my point
of view, we treated him like a king.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Wade was contacted by the classical scholar Bob Brier,
a professor of philosophy and Egyptology at the C.W. Post campus of
Long Island University in New York. After years of studying
hieroglyphs and investigating tombs, Brier had decided that his
research would not be complete until he mummified a human body. The
problem: where to get the body.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague put him in touch with Wade, who agreed to help. They
became partners in a plot to re-create ancient Egyptian techniques
of body preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Wade and Brier waited months for the perfect subject _ someone
who was relatively healthy and physically intact. Finally, the
ideal candidate arrived: a 187-pound man in his 70s, dead after a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Following 2,000-year-old descriptions of mummifying techniques
and using only replicas of ancient tools, Wade and Brier
transformed the body into an Egyptian-style mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Although critics say the team's project was frivolous, both men
insist their purpose was to understand _ in real time _ how and why
certain procedures were accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was not a mummy,'' Brier says sternly. ``The goal was
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Brier and Wade were determined to answer nagging questions
regarding Egyptian mummification. Why did it take 70 days, as Greek
historians Diodorus Siculus and Herodotus claimed? How did they
remove the organs and minimize injury to the body's exterior? How
was the brain removed?
</P>
<P>
   Removing the brain, Brier emphasizes, was the critical step _
and it proved a challenge. Herodotus had described taking clumps of
brain tissue out by hooking it on the end of a metal tool and
lifting it out one chunk at a time. But Wade and Brier found that
brain tissue wasn't dense enough to hold together for that kind of
removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tissue just doesn't adhere to the tool,'' Brier says. ``We
had to put the hook in and rotate it like a whisk.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed to thread the whisk up the nostril and through the
olfactory tract to get it into the skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did figure the whisking out, the brain tissue poured
out pink, with a little blood, like a strawberry milk shake,''
Brier says.
</P>
<P>
   To cleanse the skull, they wound linen strips on the end of the
hook and swabbed out excess tissue and moisture. Then they packed
the skull with linen rubbed with frankincense _ one of the seven
sacred substances the ancient mummifiers used. The other sacred
substances known are myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to extract and preserve the internal organs.
(The brain, considered unimportant, was discarded.) Because ancient
Egyptians believed that the dead would use their bodies in the next
life, minimizing damage to the exterior was crucial. The organs had
to be removed through a small, three-inch cut in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Herodotus, the first incision was made with a sharp
``Ethiopian stone.'' Brier took the term to mean obsidian _ a
glassy black volcanic rock that can be flaked to a razor's edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obsidian is sharper and thinner than any surgeon's scalpel,''
Brier says. ``Inside the body we used bronze and copper knives, but
obsidian was definitely meant for making the first slit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade, the designated surgeon, then reached into the slit with a
small copper knife firmly wedged between his first and second
fingers so that only a few centimeters of blade peeked out. The
first organs removed, Wade recalls, were the upper intestinal tract
and the pancreas. Next were the spleen, kidneys, bladder and more
of the digestive tract. The intestines, colon, stomach, liver and
lungs followed.
</P>
<P>
   The heart _ considered the nexus of thought and soul by ancient
Egyptians _ was left in the rib cage. When the deceased approached
Osiris in the afterlife, his heart would be weighed. If it was as
light as the feather of Maat, the goddess of truth, the person was
a step closer to being accepted by the gods.
</P>
<P>
   As a final touch, 29 linen-wrapped packets of natron were tucked
inside the body. In addition to collecting water, hastening
desiccation and absorbing foul odors, the packets helped preserve
the natural contours of the body for its resurrection in the
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wade and Brier placed the body on a wooden platform covered
with natron and heaped more natron upon it. The organs were placed
on ceramic platters nearby. They, too, were covered with natron.
</P>
<P>
   Just as salts will preserve and dry meats, the natron _ 580
pounds of it _ would draw out the body's moisture and render the
dried flesh impervious to bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The platform holding the body and the other organs was put into
an embalming preparation room in the basement of Wade's department
and left at 90 to 107 degrees Fahrenheit. Two dehumidifiers working
around the clock for 35 days would re-create the dry desert
conditions of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   At midday of the 35th day, Wade and Brier opened the room
containing the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natron was wet,'' Wade remembers. ``It smelled like wet
sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The white, sandy compound had clumped on top of the body and
become stiff from the fluids it had absorbed. The body, originally
156 pounds with its organs removed, ``now weighed 79 pounds,'' Wade
said. ``He lost 77 pounds of water.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time to remove the natron packets through the initial
cut. ``The incision had been drawn tight by the body's shrinking,''
Wade says. ``I could barely get my hand in it.'' Brier and Wade
managed to get out all but a few.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Wade and Brier began the beautification process.
First they rubbed the skin with linen strips that had been soaked
in oil containing frankincense, myrrh, cedar, lotus and palm wine.
Then they wrapped the body with linen strips, securing it with dabs
of lacquer made of cedar resin.
</P>
<P>
   According to ancient texts, the body was supposed to be kept
under natron for 35 days, and then kept around, exposed, for
another 35 _ perhaps for a period of mourning or other religious
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, Brier and Wade departed from Egyptian tradition
and waited 140 days to make the final preparations. The body had
lost more moisture. It now weighed about 70 pounds. This was the
day to complete its linen shroud and inscribe the cloth with
appropriate prayers. Each finger, toe and limb was wrapped
individually, and as each was done, Brier recited a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Now the mummy rests three doors down from Wade's office. It has
been admired by museum-goers and coveted by Egyptologists as a
control for analyzing the physical conditions of ancient mummies.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic archaeologists can already determine if the person
mummified had parasites, arthritis, or sometimes, bacterial
disease. Now that they know what mummification does to the body's
tissues, they can extrapolate with more accuracy the health
conditions of ancients who were mummified.
</P>
<P>
   If Brier uttered the proper prayers as the final wrappings were
applied, the Egypt of the afterlife may have a new, unexpected
citizen. &QL;

   The world's first bowling robot hunkers down in an alley in
Muskegon, Mich., plotting its next strike. Ten feet high and 20
feet long, with an arm the size of a howitzer and springs like
rocket launchers, Throbot weighs more than 8 tons. Stored in its
Pentium-powered brain are tens of thousands of throws by dozens of
human bowlers, their exact spin, velocity and position recorded by
video cameras, ultrasonic and infrared sensors, and a
computer-aided tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary,'' says Bill Orlikowski, a professional
bowler whose throws the machine often imitates. ``I sit behind it
and get the same feeling as when I'm bowling.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarier still, to the average weekend player, may be the sheer
scientific sophistication of modern bowling. Professional bowling
now requires space-age equipment _ urethane balls, plastic-coated
pins, lanes laser-inspected for smoothness _ and true success is
measured in thousandths of inches.
</P>
<P>
   The key to getting strikes, of course, is slamming the ball into
the ``pocket'' _ for right-handers, the space between the first pin
and the one angled behind it to the right.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. A ball that hits the pocket
straight on will deflect away from the pins, rather than
ricocheting through the pyramid. To knock down every pin, it should
hit the pocket after veering six degrees from its original path,
says Roger Dalkin, executive director of the American Bowling
congress. ``But you have to hit a target 1 inch wide that's 60 feet
away, and more hook equals less accuracy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where science and technology can help. Beneath a bowling
ball's urethane shell lies a dense core of polyester infused with
calcium carbonate or barium sulfate. This structure lowers a ball's
inertia by concentrating its weight in the center, thus helping the
ball to roll faster and more easily.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly off-center, irregularly shaped core also lends itself
to sidespin, which makes a ball curve down the lane. To see what
works best, bowling engineers use computers to model balls. When a
prototype is ready at the Brunswick Bowling research center in
Muskegon, Throbot gets it.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Bill Wasserberger, Brunswick's director of
high-performance bowling-ball research and development, placed one
of his creations into Throbot's paw _ a U-shaped chuck, set at a
10-degree angle _ and set it spinning. When the ball reached 300
revolutions per minute (the forward rotation an average bowler can
achieve), the giant arm swung back, locked with a thunk and then
slowly tightened its springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A solid professional bowler has about an inch and a half
variation five feet down the lane,'' Wasserberger said. ``Throbot
has between two- and four-tenths of an inch.'' By the time the arm
hurtled forward and the ball blasted out at a programmed height and
angle, a strike seemed preordained. Yet even Throbot can't control
every variable.
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain a ball's speed, bowling lanes are usually
coated in mineral oil once or twice a day, Wasserberger explained.
In a typical bowling alley, the edges of the lane are lightly
oiled, and the last 20 feet are left dry. That way, a ball with
sidespin can better grip the lane, curving clear of the gutter and
hooking into the pocket at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But lane oil is hardly a constant. Alley owners can slather
their lanes with various types and quantities of it. Professional
lanes are coated with an even layer of oil across their entire
width, but they still suffer more from patchy distribution as balls
spread the oil around. Because a bowler can't see the oil pattern
from the top of the lane, his first toss is a blind trial. After
that, he can adjust his throw, try a different ball or, as a last
resort, sand or polish his original ball to alter its coefficient
of friction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get rid of some of the guesswork, Wasserberger's
engineers had given the ball he was testing an arrow-shaped core
and a shell made of a new kind of urethane called Proactive. The
core made the ball change its axis as it rolled, so a dry part of
the ball touched by the lane on every turn, thereby improving its
grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the ball gets to the back part of the lane, you
get an increase in hooking action,'' Wasserberger said. Whenever
the ball hit an especially oily patch, special particles in the
urethane shell (Wasserberger wouldn't reveal their composition)
increased the ball's traction.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate the difference such small changes can make,
Wasserberger had Throbot try the exact same throw with a more
traditional ball. This time, it swung short of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there is no limit to how precise and powerful a
bowling ball could be made. But the American Bowling Congress and
the Women's International Bowling Congress keep a sharp eye on
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In one room at the congresses' joint testing center in
Greendale, Wis., 16-pound balls are weighed to make certain that
their balance isn't off-center by more than an ounce. In another
room, a ball rolls down a ramp and through an archway strung with
fiber-optic infrared sensors. When the ball hits a pin, both the
ball speed and the pin speed are measured to ensure that no more
than 35 percent of the ball's energy has been transferred to the
pin.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a ball on a conveyor belt continually climbs another
ramp and then knocks down sets of newly manufactured pins. If they
give higher or lower scores than regulations allow, they won't be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling lanes have their own strict specifications to meet: They
are not supposed to have dips, peaks or crosswise tilts of more
than 40-thousandths of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   But John Davis, president and chief engineer of the Kegel
Company in Sebring, Fla., thinks there is still room for
improvement. Forty-thousandths of an inch may be less than the
thickness of a quarter, he says, ``but that amount of tilt can
affect how a lane plays.''
</P>
<P>
   One machine Davis has designed scoots down a lane, stopping
every two feet to check the surface topography with a laser at 80
separate points across the boards. Another of his inventions uses
microprocessors and fluid measuring devices to apply as little as
one-thousandth of an ounce of oil to each board of the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it doesn't matter on the recreational level,'' Davis
says. ``But why wouldn't you want the same conditions as the
competitive level to compare yourself to the stars?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, success or failure lies in human hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the technology in the world,'' Wasserberger say, ``can't
help you if you stink.''

<P>
   When Philip Seymour Hoffman walks into the greasy spoon near his
West Village apartment, a hat with ear flaps is pulled down low on
his head, a blue muffler up high to his freezing nose, leaving
visible only a narrow strip of skin.
</P>
<P>
   It's the coldest day in New York in three years, and his
dark-framed glasses start to fog up within seconds. With the
sneakers and baggy work pants, he looks a little like the attendant
at your local gas station who always has a friendly wave and a
smile but is kind of scary anyway.
</P>
<P>
   He says hello to the waitress, who's waiting to lock up. Letting
her call it a day, Hoffman leads the way across Eighth Avenue to
another tiny cafe, where he greets the counter man with the same
familiarity he did the waitress. Both treat him like a regular, a
neighborhood guy who appreciates a good slice of apple pie. They
seem genuinely oblivious to the fact that their customer is one of
the fastest rising actors in the business.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Hoffman has made the difficult leap from
anonymous but respected character actor (``Oh yeah, that guy'' in
movies from ``Boogie Nights'' to ``Twister'') to leading man
(``Flawless,'' David Mamet's upcoming ``State and Main'').
</P>
<P>
   With two big movies (``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' and
``Magnolia'') now in theaters _ which together earned him the
National Board of Review's best supporting actor award _ Hoffman
has begun rehearsals for his Broadway debut, in a revival of Sam
Shepard's ``True West,'' which opened in March. This was Shepard's
first day sitting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was f---ing frightening,'' Hoffman admits with no hint of
pretense. The enigmatic playwright's presence isn't the only thing
giving Hoffman a case of the nerves. ``It wouldn't be scary if I
was one of the guys in the town in ``Our Town,'' you know what I
mean?'' he says with a laugh, then digs into that apple pie. ``Then
it would just be kind of fun _ like, I'm on Broadway, let's give it
a go.''
</P>
<P>
   This situation, he says, is more like ``Flawless,'' in which he
played a drag queen opposite Robert De Niro, ``picking the most
difficult situation to jump into new territory.'' He is referring
not just to the emotional intensity of ``True West,'' about two
brothers reunited in their mother's house, but to director Matthew
Warchus' decision to have Hoffman and his co-star, John C. Reilly,
swap parts every three or four performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not our idea,'' Hoffman says. ``In fact, that was one
of the reasons, when they came to me in the first place, I was not
interested. I was like, `I'm not going to do that. That's hokey.'''
</P>
<P>
   But then Reilly, who appeared with him in all three Paul Thomas
Anderson movies _ ``Hard Eight,'' ``Boogie Nights'' and
``Magnolia'' _ talked him into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil's probably the only person whose work I look at and go,
`Aw, man,''' Reilly says. ``It's like, where the hell did he come
up with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Both men agree that they wouldn't have wanted to do the play
with a total stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two actors really have to trust each other,'' Hoffman
says, ``because you're giving up your part to the other person
every few days, then taking it back. It's so intimate what these
actors are doing. It's like trading bodily fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's shed his winter layers, by the way, Hoffman isn't
scary at all. Disheveled, yes, with blond hair sticking out in
every direction, and enough reddish growth on his face to indicate
he's giving his razor a lengthy vacation.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't really resemble any of his extraordinarily diverse
characters _ certainly not Allen, the overweight obscene
phone-caller in ``Happiness,'' or Scotty, the chubby, lovesick
production assistant in ``Boogie Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Hoffman isn't fat. A high-school jock before
discovering acting, he's a husky, powerfully built guy. But he's
also not vain, evidenced by his willingness to pork up to 230 for
slob-loser effect in ``Happiness.'' (Standing 5-feet-10-inches
tall, he says he was a trim 190 for ``State and Main'' but has
since put on 25 pounds because he quit smoking.)
</P>
<P>
   Some in the press, though, have been less than kind about his
physique, which has become a sore spot. Asked if there are any
characters he doesn't think he could play, Hoffman interprets the
question to be about his looks and brings up an unflattering review
of ``Flawless.'' (Overall, though the movie was panned, Hoffman's
reviews were superb.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy started commenting, `Phil's just not right for this
part. He's way too big for the dress he's in,''' he remembers. ``It
was something like that, but it was really kind of cruel and stupid
and just ignorant. You just wanted to find the guy and be like,
`Umm, I'm playing a guy who thinks he's a woman, jackass. That's
the whole f---ing point. What do you think, only skinny men are
these people? Only non-muscular men? Have you walked around Chelsea
lately?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that Hoffman is not entirely comfortable in a
profession that has always been _ and always will be _ heavily
based on looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get carried away with it,'' he says. ``Relax. Is the guy
acting well or not? Is she acting well or not? Are you caught up in
the story or not? Pay attention to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is, Hoffman may not be the gorgeous guy you drool
over from afar, but he's the one you end up falling in love with.
Which may be why David Mamet cast him as the lead in ``State and
Main,'' due out in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really respect David for hiring me, because I don't think I
was the guy most people would think of to play the kind of Jimmy
Stewart role,'' he says, laughing. ``No one told me this, but I
have this feeling that there was somebody cast, and that didn't
work out. It was pretty close to shooting that I got hired _ like
three weeks before shooting _ and it was the lead of the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which he describes as being about truth and the battle
not to sell out, stars Hoffman as a beleaguered screenwriter who
comes to a small town in Vermont to shoot his movie and falls in
love with a local woman, played by Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon.
</P>
<P>
   After some of the extreme characters he's portrayed, Hoffman
welcomed the chance to play an everyman _ and one who gets the
girl. But he insists the part was no less challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romantic leads are really more character roles than
anything,'' he explains. ``They're people falling in love, so just
how glamorous can that be? Think about it: Not knowing what to say,
feeling uncomfortable, feeling awkward _ or feeling completely not
awkward, so therefore you're saying stupid s--t all the time. It's
really kind of a bumbling thing, falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is so passionate about what he's saying that it's hard
to figure out where the character ends and he begins. He is cagey
about his personal life, at one point mentioning in passing that he
briefly moved to Los Angeles in his 20s ``for some woman,'' and
otherwise skirting the issue with, ``I take the Fifth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he returns to the subject on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time it's truly hard to be yourself is when you're
madly in love, obsessively in love,'' he says, ``because you're
really scared that you suck, that they're going to find out that
you suck. It's hard to be comfortable in your own skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the 32-year-old Hoffman is most comfortable is in the
theater. He had his start there in high school, outside of
Rochester, N.Y., after being sidelined with a sports injury. Then
he chose New York University to study drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no desire to do film at all,'' he says. ``I thought it
was silly _ not that film was silly, but that me acting in film was
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie roles came early on anyway, in ``Scent of a Woman,''
``Nobody's Fool,'' ``The Big Lebowski'' and a couple dozen others,
and Hoffman found himself moving easily between stage and movie
set. He's on the board of the LAByrinth Theatre Co. and received
strong notices last summer for his first directorial effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``No money being made,'' he says of the company, ``and really,
purely, some great stuff being created.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Boogie Nights'' hit theaters in 1997, people had
begun to take notice of him, and then Hoffman auditioned for
``Happiness,'' director Todd Solondz' dark comedy about a group of
miserable New Jerseyites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never met Phil or heard of him,'' Solondz says, ``and was
terribly disappointed to discover that Paul Thomas Anderson had
already discovered him. I wanted to take credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Warchus, in turn, had recently seen ``Happiness'' when
he started looking for two ``chameleon-like actors'' who could do
``True West'' with the chance of transcending the typical
comparisons to the classic team of John Malkovich and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person I thought of was Phil,'' he remembers. ``He
is quite extreme without losing truth or plausibility. I think
that's a gift, not a skill.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Reilly calls him ``a searcher'' and gushes, ``Phil can
make a meal out of the littlest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to the scene in ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' in which
Hoffman, playing Matt Damon's uppercrust tormenter, is listening to
records with Jude Law and cuts Damon down with just a withering
stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been one of those light days. But you're just
like, `Goddamn, look at Phil Hoffman.' One scene with no dialog
establishes what the whole character's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman admits that the snobby Freddie Miles ``was exquisitely
fun to play'' _ and not just because it meant six weeks in Rome
with plenty of time for espresso, sightseeing with Cate Blanchett
and her husband and even some Italian lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddie's extraordinarily wealthy, floats around Europe and
hangs out with affluent, well-educated, literary people,'' Hoffman
says. ``I drank beer in the woods. That's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   His slight regional accent has led him to create a different
voice for virtually every character.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's writing parts for redheaded guys who grew up in
Fairport, N.Y.,'' he says. ``It's just not happening. I don't have
(the accent) as much, but my mouth is lazy.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``I remember reading it and
just going --'' he breaks off, reshaping his mouth into Freddie's
smirk. ``They sound like they're from England, but they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman used his own voice as the tenderhearted nurse Phil in
``Magnolia,'' which he calls ``one of the best movies I've ever
been in. It's really ballsy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed and more than a little irritated at the beating
it's taken from some critics (though his reviews have been
characteristically excellent), he adds, ``I really do think in 20
years people are going to talk about `Magnolia' as the movie that
was extraordinarily profound at the time it came out, saying
something about the numbness and cynicism of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he jumps out of his chair to help an elderly woman
and her pushcart into the cafe. When he returns to the table,
Hoffman has one last story to tell. It's about shooting the
surreal, climactic frog scene in ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what his directors and colleagues have to say about his
talent, Hoffman insists acting comes naturally to no one, certainly
not him. But he's also not a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to act like there are thousands of frogs,'' he
remembers, ``and I have to start the scene crying. I was just fed
up, and I couldn't. I was freaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crew waited at 4 a.m. to get the shot and go home to bed,
Hoffman struggled. Finally, out of pure frustration, he began to
cry. Paul Thomas Anderson called action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not a squirt-in-the-eye kind of guy,'' Hoffman
says. ``Morally, I feel like I'd burst into flames if I did
that.'' &QL;

   When Philip Seymour Hoffman walks into the greasy spoon near his
West Village apartment, a hat with ear flaps is pulled down low on
his head, a blue muffler up high to his freezing nose, leaving
visible only a narrow strip of skin.
</P>
<P>
   It's the coldest day in New York in three years, and his

<P>
   He says hello to the waitress, who's waiting to lock up. Letting
her call it a day, Hoffman leads the way across Eighth Avenue to
another tiny cafe, where he greets the counter man with the same
familiarity he did the waitress. Both treat him like a regular, a
neighborhood guy who appreciates a good slice of apple pie. They
seem genuinely oblivious to the fact that their customer is one of
the fastest rising actors in the business.

<P>
   MILAN _ He's played every role from gigolo to gentleman, and now
Richard Gere is starring as the resourceful Italian butler
Ambrogio.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrogio?
</P>
<P>
   Gere and a string of other top names including Brad Pitt,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis and Harrison Ford
are pocketing millions plugging Italian products from sunglasses to
spumante in ads that appear almost everywhere _ except the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood stars have long boosted their income with lucrative ad
campaigns fashioned mostly for the Japanese and other Asian
markets. Now American actors are marching westward _ and directly
into Italy _ where companies are waiting with open purses and
high-quality, if sometimes silly, campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood is the most vigorous industry in the world _ on all
levels. It influences people's tastes, and its events echo
throughout the world,'' said Silvia Damiani, who just hired Brad
Pitt to star in the ads for her family-run jewelry company.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons for Italians' latest love affair with
Hollywood: ``With e-commerce and the single currency, Italian
companies, which have traditionally used local celebrities, want to
appear less provincial, more global. What could be better than
trading on the universal, cosmopolitan allure of a Hollywood
actor?'' said Luca Vercelloni of GPF &AMP; Associati, a research
institute and consultancy here.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Italians may not be as generous as the Japanese _
who won't blink at paying $4 million for a celebrity-focused
campaign _ they are more than willing to loosen their purse strings
for a Hollywood face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fees start at about six or seven figures and can go up to
several millions of dollars depending on how long the ad is used
and in how many countries,'' said Reuben Igielko-Herrlich, an owner
of the Geneva-based Propaganda, which specializes in product
placement, special events and corporate advertising. ``There is no
rule, and no flat fee. Everything is negotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Stone and Bruce Willis were among the first to arrive in
Italy. In 1997, Stone shot a Spumanti Martini ad in which she plays
herself as an awards presenter on Oscar night. The ad was so
popular that it has run every year since.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis did the European print campaign for De Rigo's
Police sunglasses, which appeared in more than 60 countries, and
he'll be starring in the next campaign, which breaks later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Agents for Stone, Willis and Gere refused to have their client's
images appear in an American newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Igielko-Herrlich added that American actors _ whether they
appear in films or ad campaigns _ can boost the popularity of a
brand in record time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communication is a long-term strategy, so it's hard to
quantify the results of a specific campaign. One thing we've
observed, however, is that consumers will walk into a store and ask
for a specific product they've seen a star use on screen,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why the chocolate company Ferrero chose
Richard Gere for its latest television campaign. Last year Ferrero,
which makes Nutella and other sweets, needed a high-voltage TV
campaign to replace the successful but long-running one for its
Ferrero Rocher chocolates. The old ads starred the tireless
Ambrogio, a chauffeur and butler, who regularly dispensed the
elegant chocolates, wrapped in gold foil, to his socialite boss.
</P>
<P>
   In the new ad, Gere plays himself and is watching La Traviata
when he spots a young woman _ clearly in need of a chocolate _
sitting in the balcony of the theater. As if by magic, the
chocolate appears in front of her. When the woman, who by then
recognizes Gere, goes to thank him she says: ``But aren't you...?''
and he replies: ``Ambrogio.''
</P>
<P>
   A Ferrero spokeswoman said the ad was by far the most popular in
the history of the company. It was so successful, in fact, that the
actor is filming a sequel that will air in Italy in September.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ferrero's choice of Gere in particular, the spokeswoman
said: ``He's elegant yet accessible _ and he's everyone's Prince
Charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Acceleration is also the reason why Fiat chose to use Harrison
Ford in its Lancia Lybra ads, and Catherine Zeta-Jones in its Alfa
Romeo Sportwagon campaign, which broke here recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catherine Zeta-Jones is one of the hottest names in the world,
and this is an international campaign. She will help accelerate
awareness of the brand in the 17 European countries where the ad
appears,'' said Luca Lindner, chief executive of Conquest Network,
which developed the ad.
</P>
<P>
   While Fiat worked with another agency, Armando Testa, to create
the Lancia ads, the idea behind both campaigns is the same: sleek
image, speedy delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancia ad shows Harrison Ford reviving a dying plant by
placing it on the passenger seat of the car and cruising on the
open road. In print, he poses on the hood of the car with a caption
that says: ``It doesn't matter how far you've traveled, just how.''
</P>
<P>
   An Armando Testa spokesman said Fiat believes Ford embodies the
rock-solid values of Europe's ``new middle class ... which offers
large growth potential for Lancia Lybra.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that actors' primary motivation for doing the ads is
money, but there are other reasons as well. And while all the
actors mentioned declined to comment for this story, the Italian
companies are proud to talk about why they chose to be in a
specific campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero said Gere donated his fee _ a reported $1.4 million _ to
the cause to free Tibet. Damiani said Pitt walked into her store
looking to buy a ring for his girlfriend Jennifer Aniston, and the
two became friends.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who has appeared in Japanese automobile and beer ads, told
Italian newspapers last year that he's proud of his publicity work:
``I hope that the U.S. comes to accept the idea of actors appearing
in TV ads.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be too long in coming: ``I can understand that
actors are protective of their images in their main market _ the
U.S. _ and that one bad TV advertisement can be damaging,'' said
Federico Fasolino, a partner in Brw, one of Italy's foremost
advertising production companies. ``On the flip side, a well-done
campaign can actually be a vehicle to boost or relaunch a career,''
he added. &QL;

 &HT;    Marchers against Confederate flag meet opposition along S.C.
route
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONCKS CORNER, S.C. _ From the tailgate of a Chevy pickup truck,
Sharon Mims taunted Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, walking briskly
amid 65 marchers protesting the Confederate flag atop the
Statehouse in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the second day of the Charleston-to-Columbia march
organized by Riley, and walkers met their first organized
opposition from flag wavers encamped at crossroads and in driveways
along U.S. 176.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riley, we appreciate you picking this road right in the heart
of the Lowcountry,'' Mims called over the honking of horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Confederate flag is our history,'' said Mims, 38, waving a
bandana of red, white and blue as she sat in the driveway of her
home. ``You do not fold it up and put it away.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a blaring message intended for legislators who today
resume the debate over moving the controversial banner from atop
the nation's last state capital to fly it. The state Legislature
raised the Confederate flag atop the Statehouse in 1962, and a vote
of the Legislature is required to move it.
</P>
<P>
   When the march ends Thursday at the Statehouse, Riley intends to
present to Gov. Jim Hodges, a fellow Democrat, the blue-and-white
state flag being carried by marchers. Flag supporters also plan a
rally in Columbia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, an estimated 300 flag supporters mobilized at
Carnes Crossroads, near Moncks Corner, to await marchers finishing
the first day of their 120-mile trek. But marchers stopped before
reaching the crossroads, setting up Monday's first encounter
between flag supporters and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a peaceful passing, interspersed with an
occasional exchange of remarks amid a heavy police escort for
marchers.
</P>
<P>
   State troopers on motorcycles instructed protesters not to cross
the white line at the edge of the highway, or to extend their
Confederate banners over the road.
</P>
<P>
   The flag supporters vowed to stage protests all the way to
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   As Riley walked, passing thickets of lavender wisteria littered
with beer cans and fast-food wrappers, he said he wouldn't respond
to protesters. ``The meanest thing we can do is to ignore them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day, plainclothes policemen flanked Charleston's
longtime mayor. He wore a bulletproof vest under his green shirt,
after receiving an anonymous handwritten death threat containing
racial slurs. Riley said he was ``confident it came from a
crackpot.''

 &HT;    Gingriches sign divorce settlement likely to stay secret
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A lawyer for Newt Gingrich says the former U.S. House
speaker and his wife have signed a final divorce settlement and are
ready to take the agreement to a Cobb County courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all done except for the formality of going to the judge
and getting it approved,'' said attorney Randy Evans.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb County Superior Court Judge Dorothy Robinson has set a
hearing for Thursday morning. Even if Robinson accepts the
settlement, which is nearly certain, its terms will likely remain a
secret. Evans said both sides will ask the judge to sign an order
sealing the agreement, which would keep it out of the public court
file.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Marianne Gingrich could not be reached for comment
about the settlement, which is the product of more than three
months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got this much stuff, you just try to take your
time and get it right,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches agreed to settle their divorce Dec. 16, 1999,
during a court-ordered mediation session that lasted 12 hours and
ended well after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement, which the Gingriches have kept private,
ended what had become a bitter divorce process for Gingrich and his
wife of 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of potentially embarrassing depositions in the case
led Gingrich, 56, to admit to a six-year affair with Callista
Bisek, a 33-year-old scheduler for the U.S. House Agriculture
Committee. Divorce attorneys watching the case predicted early on
that Gingrich would settle the case, rather than allow his personal
life to be examined in a public trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingriches' divorce will be Newt Gingrich's second, and
Marianne Gingrich's first.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had no children together.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich filed for divorce July 19, 1999, six months after
resigning the 6th District seat he held in Congress for 20 years,
and from the speakership he won in 1994 after leading House
Republicans to their first majority in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Gingrich, 48, has remained in the couple's Marietta,
Ga., home during the divorce proceedings. Gingrich has spent most
of his time in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich makes a living these days giving speeches, sitting on
corporate boards, consulting and appearing as a political analyst
on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   He also holds two fellowships and maintains a nonprofit
committee devoted to his political ideals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall, CBS invested more than $30 million in revamping its
morning news show. It brought in one of the pre-eminent stars of
morning television, Bryant Gumbel, as well as one of its most
experienced producers, Steve Friedman, and declared that after more
than four decades of futility it was finally making a serious bid
to be competitive in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Five months after Gumbel's highly publicized return to morning
television, accompanied with the fanfare of a glorious new setting
in a studio overlooking Central Park at 59th Street, the futility
has only deepened. Ratings for the new CBS News morning broadcast,
``The Early Show,'' have defied most expectations by decreasing
significantly from its far less costly, less promoted and virtually
unpublicized predecessor, ``CBS This Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter of the new year, which ended last week,
``The Early Show'' was down in every rating category, most
significantly having lost about 440,000 viewers a day from the
totals CBS was attracting in the corresponding period last year,
when Mark McEwen was the show's host.
</P>
<P>
   And this decline has taken place at the same time that both of
CBS' network competitors, NBC's ``Today'' show and ABC's ``Good
Morning America,'' have managed to buck the general trend of
network television by substantially increasing their audiences.
``Today,'' still the dominant show, added almost 400,000 viewers
over last year, while ``Good Morning America'' has added more than
600,000 viewers.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, CBS executives had confidence that their $30
million investment was wisely spent. Andrew Heyward, the president
of CBS News, said at the time: ``I think we're going to do better;
the question is how much. We've got almost nothing but upside.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first-quarter numbers arrived, Heyward said he was
unconcerned. ``Of course we would have preferred to see growth
sooner, but this is a long, difficult process,'' he said. ``I'm in
no way disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   And Friedman, the show's senior executive producer, who twice
earlier in his career held the top producing job at ``Today,''
said, ``If we weren't doing a good show I'd be disappointed.'' He
also said that the decline in overall viewers may be a result of
the show's efforts to be, as he put it, ``younger and edgier.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman cited figures showing that CBS had managed to lower the
median age of its audience from 55.9 last year to 54.1 this year.
That means that most of the viewers the show has lost were older,
Friedman said. He pointed to the advance in the median age for both
the other shows, with ``Today'' moving from 51.2 to 51.5 and ``Good
Morning America'' going from 52.8 to 53.2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Early Show'' replaced a hybrid morning show that CBS had
been using, with local stations in most cities producing the first
hour of a morning news show followed by a national program from CBS
News in the second hour. CBS executives said this shift had hurt
them in the ratings. Those local numbers did count nationally
because they contained national commercials. Many of those local
shows had strong followings in their cities, the CBS executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the faltering ratings may also mean that some of the cities
that still do not carry the first hour of ``The Early Show'' may be
more reluctant to do so in the future, Friedman acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   One factor CBS discounted as significant in the show's ratings
struggles is the publicity surrounding the bitter divorce
proceedings between Gumbel and his wife, June. That has been the
subject of much coverage in tabloid newspapers, and some industry
analysts have suggested that it could not help Gumbel, who has
scored poorly among women viewers in some research studies.
Friedman said that he hoped viewers could ``separate people's
private lives from their professional lives.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS had expected that at least ``Good Morning America'' might be
vulnerable, because its two anchors, Diane Sawyer and Charles
Gibson, had agreed to take over the show last January only
temporarily. But now ``Good Morning America'' has solidified its
position as the clear No. 2 show. It has been extremely competitive
with ``Today'' for many of the biggest news interviews, though not
always without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The series of interviews with Elian Gonzalez brought ``Good
Morning America'' both heavy publicity and heavy criticism last
week for the decision to allow a 6-year-old to be interviewed
without parental permission. Still, it now seems that Sawyer and
Gibson have settled in for a long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' has continued to expand what has been the biggest lead
ever in morning television. In the first quarter, the show scored
the widest margin of victory ever in the audience group most sought
by advertisers in the morning, women between the ages of 18 to 49.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman acknowledged that both his competitors had grown even
stronger. He cited Katie Couric's series on colon cancer as being
``amazingly good'' and ``Good Morning America's'' overall
improvement. ``The Early Show'' may have to ``wait until one of the
other guys stumbles'' before it makes significant ratings headway,
he said.

A LEADER IN GUN SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the different ways to make handguns less likely to be
accidental killers, then-Attorney General Scott Harshbarger came up
with one of the most ingenious in 1997. Massachusetts law, he said,
gave him authority to regulate the safety of consumer items _ such
as guns. To pass muster, guns sold here would have to be built with
trigger locks, child-safety devices, tamper-proof serial numbers,
and indicators showing whether they are loaded. They couldn't be
cheap, accident-prone Saturday Night Specials.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, the gun makers fought the rules in court and
lost. Last month, the deadline for a final legal appeal passed, and
Monday Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly announced that the rules
are now in effect for all guns sold in Massachusetts, whether
manufactured here or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, the new rules should go far toward reducing
Massachusetts' share of the 40,000 gun deaths that occur nationally
each year. In 1996, 138 children under 14 died in gun accidents
nationwide. A study by the General Accounting Office found that
fully 30 percent of all accidental shootings could be prevented by
indicators or devices making it more difficult for adults or
children to fire inadvertently weapons they think are unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   But the national impact of the Harshbarger-Reilly rules could be
even greater. At least 30 other states have laws giving attorneys
general powers similar to Reilly's. Once his counterparts see
Massachusetts successfully setting safety standards, many will
likely move in this direction, too.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, in a customary kowtow to the gun lobby, has
specifically exempted the firearms industry from regulation by the
federal Consumer Product Safety Commission. But if enough states
follow Massachusetts' lead, such safety measures could become
virtually standard nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Much besides safety measures must be done. Reilly is fending off
legal challenges of the state's 1998 gun-control law that would,
among other things, make gun owners responsible for the safe
storage of their weapons. That law, combined with the safety rules,
will make this state a leader in reforming Shooting Gallery
America.

PEACE IN THE PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, the National Park Service sat on its hands while
letting the great national parks become noisy sandboxes for
visitors whose enjoyment includes use of internal-combustion
vehicles of one kind or another _ Jet Skis, snowmobiles,
all-terrain vehicles, and airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   A case can be made that these enthusiasts have a right to enjoy
the parks in their way. Apparently, not everyone thinks the
whistling of wind down through the Grand Canyon is music worth
protecting from the drone of sightseeing aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But that attitude runs smack up against the 1916 act creating
the Park Service. The law says the parks should be run so as to
``leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.''
Both present and future generations have their enjoyment impaired
by noisy, polluting vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   So the Park Service is to be applauded for proposals announced
last week that would cut down on aircraft at the Grand Canyon and
other parks and ban snowmobiles at Yellowstone. Use of Jet Skis at
Cape Cod National Seashore (where they cannot be launched but can
land at many beaches) and other shore areas will undergo a two-year
review that we hope results in more limits or total bans.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service is also proposing to move against cars
themselves at two of its most popular parks, Yosemite and the Grand
Canyon. Most visitors would leave their cars outside the parks and
use electric buses or light rail. The automobile has been so much a
part of Americans' enjoyment of the parks that limiting its use
will be controversial. But as long as sufficient provision is made
for the elderly and handicapped it is hard to argue against steps
to keep those parks from looking like the Cape's congested Route 6
on a summer Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt points out that the national
parks are not really too crowded with people _ but too much
infrastructure is needed to handle all their cars. With a better
transportation system, more visitors could be absorbed with less
impact. He's right _ even hiking trails in the busy Grand Canyon
can provide magnificent solitude, especially if no airplanes buzz
overhead.

 &HT;    Web sites and chat rooms are abuzz with Microsoft talk
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Strong graphics and strong feelings for and against
Microsoft were the order of the day on a variety of Web sites and
Internet chat forums in the hours before Monday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judgment Day'' is the huge headline on the MSNBC home page,
where there is a graphic of a gavel coming down on the Windows
logo. MSNBC (www.msnbc.com), a joint venture of Microsoft and NBC,
offers what seems to be balanced coverage including favorable
analyses of the key players at the Justice Department as well as of
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson and of Richard Posner, the judge who
attempted to mediate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a video of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates. In that
video, Gates says Microsoft ``went the extra mile'' during the four
months of heavy negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the ``picture is worth a thousand words'' category is
CNN Interactive (www.cnn.com). The lead graphic is a Microsoft logo
chopped neatly into even pieces. Before the ruling came out, CNN
wrote extensively and well about how investors were likely to fare
after the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Time.com offered interesting analysis entitled ``Get Ready for a
Roller Coaster Ride.'' (www.cnn.com/2000/US
/04/03/microsoft43.a.tm/index.html)
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Monday, CNN's Microsoft message boards were
filled with users arguing about a wide range of topics ranging from
the intricacies of the Microsoft operating system to the best way
to break up the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, when you already know you've been convicted, your
bargaining position is limited,'' one CNN user wrote. ``Microsoft
is in no position to decide whether a breakup is 'extreme' or not.
If it's good enough for Standard Oil, it's good enough for
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some users posting on ABCNews.com's Microsoft chat had
very different opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice to know there are other folks out there who think the
(U.S. Department of Justice) is messing around where they don't
belong _ trying to impede free trade and free markets,'' wrote one
ABCNews reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has done nothing wrong, and by imposing any of the
potential 'remedies' being discussed in the media, the court will
not only hamper the progress of one of America's greatest success
stories but will cause harm to our economy, our markets and our
ability to compete in international markets,'' the reader
commented.
</P>
<P>
   CNet News (www.cnet.com) has a special section, ``Microsoft on
the Ropes,'' complete with a graphic of Gates literally caught in
the wheels of justice. CNet readers in search of the full story can
click on a special CNet feature called ``The Big Picture,'' a
compilation of all the Microsoft stories relating to the case and
its participants. The news updates were focused on the company's
sliding stock price and the potential impact on investors.

politics and technology called Politech, takes a look at why
Microsoft would rather fight in Wired magazine's online version.

   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ Microsoft was found guilty
Monday of violating anti-trust laws much in the manner that the
coal, steel and oil behemoths did at the dawn of the century.
Monday's verdict by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson was the
government's second resounding victory over Microsoft. It had been
regarded as a virtual certainty since Jackson's findings of fact
last Nov. 5 that Microsoft had used its monopoly powers to strangle
competition and hurt consumers. The question now is what remedies
the judge will propose. They could include curbs on Microsoft's
business practices to a basic restructuring of the 25-year-old
company based in the Seattle area. No one expects a final decision
soon on the company's future. Microsoft has vigorously contested
the suit filed by the Justice Department's Anti-trust Division and
19 states all along, and lengthy appeals are likely, perhaps all
the way to the Supreme Court. By Joel Brinkley.

   SOUTH-EDUC (Atlanta) _ The states of the Southeast, desperate
for new ways to educate the nation's poorest and worst-performing
students, have begun to play a central role in experimenting with
education theories and school reform plans that are drawing
national attention. Almost every Southern governor is either
hunting for new school money, or trying a different combination of
familiar and occasionally untested ideas for improving student
achievement. Here in Georgia, which has taken the lead this year,
Gov. Roy E. Barnes has pushed through the state legislature a
sweeping overhaul of the education system mandating lower class
sizes, giving bonuses to teachers in good schools, ending all job
protection for teachers, and establishing a new education
bureaucracy to monitor annual testing. By David Firestone.

 &HT;    Microsoft's exit strategy focuses on wireless software, expert
says
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Microsoft sure hasn't been acting like a company
waiting for the axe of antitrust to fall on its head _ or has it?''
writes Dan Turner in the online magazine ``Feed''
(www.feedmag.com).
</P>
<P>
   Turner compiled a laundry list of deals the company has
announced in the past few weeks including plans to enter the video
game arena, and the spinoff of real estate Web site HomeAdvisor, as
well as the possibility of offering open source code _ the inner
workings of the software _ for Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   Turner suggests that the combination of Microsoft offering even
some of its code combined with the spinoffs and new ventures
``suggest the company is thinking about _ and moving toward an exit
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of the Justice Department's ruling that Microsoft did
violate U.S. antitrust laws by bullying computer makers and
Internet services to use its browser software, Microsoft's
enthusiasm for new technologies is one way to shift its focus
toward the future and away from its past.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives, interviewed recently at the company's
headquarters in Redmond, Wash., were excited about bringing the
Microsoft Network off desktop computers and onto wireless devices
such as cell phones and Palm Pilots. This has nothing to do with
operating systems and browser wars and everything to do with the
success of Yahoo and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be able to access the Internet anywhere anytime
and from any device,'' said Yusuf Mehdi, director of marketing for
the Microsoft Network. ``We want to be a leader in cellular
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   MSN Mobile is already available on Nextel and Air Touch cellular
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's right up the alley of what Microsoft is all
about,'' said Mehdi.
</P>
<P>
   Medhi said that, after years of trial and error all the way back
to the ill-fated AOL competitor Microsoft tried to launch in 1995,
the company has learned that success depends developing what it
does best: software. In this case, that means building and
developing software for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft seems like a company that can't really
function if it doesn't have some type of competition in its sights.
The competition here is Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi pointed to Amazon's legendary one-click ordering system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fabulous, but it's only on Amazon.com,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the MSN team is to make the Web experience easier
than Amazon's one-click. It is possible that MSN will devise some
technology that eventually will out-Amazon Amazon. That could
revolutionize the industry _ or lead to another lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's commitment to the Web was underscored in a forceful
way when Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer moved his offices into the MSN
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge vote of confidence,'' Mehdi says.

DEEP DEBT HAS GROUP FIGHTING TO KEEP REPLICAS OF COLUMBUS FLEET 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Tied to a bayfront pier with heavy
ropes, the 70-foot Nina rocks gently in a strong spring wind. Her
colorful Spanish flags snap from atop three stout masts, and the
squat wooden ship seems eager to hoist her sails and head for the
open sea.
</P>
<P>
   And while this 100-ton, oak-and-pine replica of one of the three
ships Christopher Columbus used to discover the New World is
certainly seaworthy, financial troubles have shackled her to the
pier.
</P>
<P>
   The ominous ``No Trespassing'' signs tacked to the Nina's hull
and the padlocked gangway, preventing a continuous stream of
curious visitors from exploring her, hint at her forlorn plight.
And her two sisters in the Columbus fleet, the Pinta and the Santa
Maria, are marooned in a concrete drydock a few blocks down the
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Far from becoming a lucrative tourist draw, the fleet is mired
in debt, controversy and bitter finger-pointing about the millions
spent to keep the ships afloat. The fleet is closed to tourists
now, as the City Council considers handing the project over to a
new group, since the current operators are insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Spanish government is negotiating to relocate the
Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria to the successful Kemah
Waterfront near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   All this is the culmination of a series of problems that began
less than a year after the ships arrived here. A runaway barge
rammed into the Pinta and Santa Maria in April 1994, and the
repairs and relocation of the boats in drydock have had disastrous
results for the Columbus Fleet Association, the nonprofit operators
of the ships.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sending the ships out of state for repairs, the
association decided to build a $3 million drydock next to the
city's history museum and hired Spanish shipwrights to come here to
make the repairs. And while Lloyds of London paid $1.7 million to
cover repairs, the association's lawsuit against the barge owner
was unsuccessful in recovering several millions in revenue lost
during the nearly two years the ships were closed until drydock
construction and repairs were completed in late 1995.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``What happened is the ships were hit and damaged, and they
never recovered,'' said Rick Stryker, director of the Corpus
Christi Museum of Science and History who has served as president
of the fleet association. ``This plaza was built so the ships could
be fixed and to keep the ships alive. And now people are
questioning it out the wazoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say it was a bad business decision. I'd say it was
bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's people who come by here all the time, all the time,
wanting to tour the boat ... You should see the traffic,'' laments
Richard Ingram, a maintenance worker who sweeps up around the pier
on the Corpus Christi bayfront where the Nina is moored. ``But
there never is anybody down here to present it to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Spanish government is working on a deal with
Houston-based Landry's Seafood Restaurants to move the ships to
Kemah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in serious discussions with Landry's about a possible
arrangement for a first-class facility for the display of the
ships,'' said James Goold, a Washington attorney who represents
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   For Corpus Christi, it is a disappointing counterpoint to the
heady expectations expressed by jubilant city leaders in 1992,
after the Spanish government was persuaded to lease the three ships
_ for $1 million with additional payments to come _ to the
nonprofit Columbus Fleet Association as a visitors attraction and
historical exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Corpus Christi was doing an enviable job of
developing its waterfront with top-line tourist attractions linked
to the sea. In 1990, the Texas State Aquarium opened its doors, and
soon after the city won the competition to bring the retired U.S.
Navy aircraft carrier USS Lexington to town as a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Corpus Christi to enter the home port
competition was helped by the tremendous interest shown during the
fleet's 1992 visit to the Americas, part of the international
celebration of the 500th anniversary of Columbus' expedition to the
New World. During a short stay in Corpus Christi, the ships
attracted 108,000 visitors, the largest crowd of any of the stops
at 18 U.S. port cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were first here there was a lot of excitement, but
we somehow lost it,'' said Ray Hernandez, a volunteer on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the lengthy litigation after the barge accident
and other problems, the ships have not lived up to the city's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Columbus ships are really an interesting attraction, and
for whatever reason, they just have not been, so far, the most
actively attended draw we have here,'' observed Tom Utter, Corpus
Christi assistant city manager.
</P>
<P>
   Last week city officials stepped in after the fleet association
declared itself insolvent and laid off its last two workers. And
the City Council voted to give another chance to a newly created
nonprofit group, backed by a group of local business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization, called Grupo Las Carabeles, was given six
months to demonstrate that the ships can pay their own way without
financial help from the city. But the deal requires approval of the
Spanish government _ an action that doesn't seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Durrill, a local beer distributor whose charitable
foundation has donated $1.3 million toward the purchase of the
ships and other expenses, wants to seek a grant to build a marina
next to the city museum at the entrance to the ship channel.
</P>
<P>
   All three ships would be docked there, and the Nina and Pinta,
which are shallow-draft vessels, would sail in Corpus Christi Bay.
The larger Santa Maria would likely be a static display because it
is too large to sail there.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Columbus Fleet Association say the lease
agreement with Spain called for the ships to be sailed. They
complain that the boats were beginning to deteriorate in the museum
drydock, which had become a permanent museum exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan would get the ships in the water where they were
originally intended to be.
</P>
<P>
   All factions agree that the Columbus fleet must be part of an
educational exhibit if the ships are to draw enough tourist revenue
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The city-owned museum already has artifacts and exhibits of
three Spanish treasure ships, which sank off the Texas coast, as
well as artifacts from the French explorer LaSalle's newly
excavated ship, La Belle. More important, the museum has on
permanent loan the 10,000-square-foot ``Seeds of Change'' exhibit
assembled for the Columbus 500th anniversary by the Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials, while acknowledging the credentials of
leaders of the nonprofit Grupo Las Carabelas, insist taxpayers will
not bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we would love to be able to help a local group, but
the council has made it very clear the city is not willing to
expend taxpayer funds on the ships,'' said Utter, the assistant
city manager.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's council meeting, it also became evident that some
city officials were unclear about financing and other details of
the new group's rescue plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the ninth inning, and I don't know who's on first,''
complained Councilman Mark Scott, as he heard the group outline its
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On the bayfront, not far from council chambers in City Hall,
tourists eager to tour the Nina say city leaders should find a way
to keep the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corpus is a heck of a seaport,'' said Wyoming retiree Dave
Pomerinke as he photographed the Nina. ``They (the ships) just seem
to fit the town.''

<P>
   NEW GOURNA, Egypt _ A half-century ago a quixotic architect
built this village from scratch, or rather from bricks made of
sun-dried mud and straw. That architect, Hassan Fathy, created
vaulted roofs punctured by small openings to direct and cool the
prevailing winds, courtyards to give each owner a ``private piece
of sky,'' crooked streets to emphasize the intimacy of houses,
communal wells to invite neighborly chats.
</P>
<P>
   It was Fathy's grand experiment, the realization of his evolving
philosophy of creating cheap housing for the poor using native
materials, indigenous designs and input from the people who would
live in his buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped that Gourna might just hint at a way to begin a
revived tradition of building, that others might later take up the
experiment, extend it and eventually establish a cultural barricade
to stop the slide into false and meaningless architecture that was
gathering speed in Egypt,'' Fathy wrote in his 1969 memoir of the
project, ``Architecture for the Poor.''
</P>
<P>
   New Gourna today is a sorry epitaph for Fathy, who died in 1989
at 89, an eccentric but at last cherished prophet in his native
Egypt. The village is inhabited by the peasants he at once
romanticized and vainly hoped to transform. But like many of the
modern architects who were influenced by his philosophy, they have
remade his vision on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have plugged up the wind catches, drastically
increasing the indoor temperature in summer and lowering it in
winter. They have covered the courtyards, blocking out the sky.
They have crammed concrete into the windows. Whenever one of the
signature Fathy domes collapses _ as they tend to do from natural
wear and a little help from the villagers _ the residents rebuild
in reinforced concrete, mimicking the anonymous urban housing
blocks Fathy so detested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed,'' said Abdel Badawi Mohammed Omar, the
proud owner of a boxy concrete house that he built on the ruins of
an original Fathy structure. ``We wanted something modern, with a
modern look.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt is now celebrating the 100th anniversary of the birth of
Fathy, its most famous architect, who received the international
Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1980 in recognition of his
influence on postmodern design but was dismissed in his own country
for most of his career as the architect of mud.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the celebration is at the American University
in Cairo, which received Fathy's voluminous personal archives in
1994. On March 23 the university opened an exhibition in its Rare
Books Library of his architectural drawings, design notes,
furniture, gouaches in the style of Persian miniatures, and
sometimes acerbic accounts of his battles with Egyptian
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   If few of Fathy's altruistic building projects remain, his ideas
have made an indelible impact internationally. They provided an
essential source in the development of vernacular design programs
at institutions like the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Fathy defined the source for creating architecture
that had been untapped before him,'' said Abdelhalim I. Abdelhalim,
a leading Cairo architect who described Fathy as his inspiration
and the reason he returned home to Egypt from Berkeley 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The centennial exhibition, while limited in scope, provides
snapshots of Fathy's life: his formal training in the Beaux-Arts
style, his experiments with building materials like reeds and mud,
his attraction to the simple practicality of Nubian design, and the
domed homes he designed for wealthy clients in Egypt and the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Fathy was born a landowner's son in Alexandria and grew up on
his mother's idealized stories of her youth in the countryside. As
a young man, he once wrote, he dreamed that if he had all the money
in the world, he would do one of two things. He would buy a yacht,
hire an orchestra and sail around the world with friends listening
to Bach, Schumann and Brahms. Or he would build a village where the
fellaheen, or Egyptian peasants, ``would follow the way of life
that I would like them to.''
</P>
<P>
   That fascination with the possibilities of social engineering
through architecture was to define Fathy's career. But he was also
passionate about low-cost housing for the poor, and he realized
early on that he would be fighting a lonely battle against
short-sighted government clerks, politically powerful contractors
and the peasants themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to build a village came in 1945, when the
Egyptian antiquities authorities hired him to create New Gourna
near Luxor in Upper Egypt. The idea was to relocate the settlement
of Gourna, which sat squarely on a network of pharaonic tombs, and
to get Gourna's tomb robbers out of the way of temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than compensating the villagers directly, the authorities
gave the money to Fathy, ensuring that the residents would see him
as little more than an agent of the government bent on forcibly
evicting them from their traditional homes. Instead of
participating in the design of their new homes as Fathy had
envisioned, most of the prospective residents of New Gourna refused
even to talk to him. They sabotaged a system of dikes at the new
site, flooding the unfinished village and damaging the foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the project gave Fathy the chance to test theories that
ran counter to all that was fashionable in architecture at the
time. Instead of the machine as metaphor and the industrial age as
idiom, he sought an integration with nature.
</P>
<P>
   He was fascinated, for instance, by the Nubian custom in Upper
Egypt of orienting rooms according to the position of the sun in
different seasons, so that they would be cool in summer and warm in
winter. In New Gourna he also studied the prevailing winds and
built his houses with funnels that drew air inside and cooled it
over wet charcoal.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted, too, on a village where people would live
according to his personal vision. He built a space to exhibit
crafts, thinking that the relocated peasants would rediscover
long-lost artisanship. Eschewing the idea of running water directly
to each house as too expensive and unsuited to village customs, he
installed neighborhood wells and rhapsodized about the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine a village in Egypt without its
black-robed women,'' he wrote, ``erect as queens, each with her
water jar carried nonchalantly on her head, and it will be a pity
to lose the sight.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end the people of old Gourna could not be persuaded to
move to Fathy's village. (The government to this day is trying with
limited success to bulldoze Gourna out of existence.) The project
was simply abandoned in the upheaval after the 1952 Egyptian
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years squatters took over neglected buildings,
demolished the school to farm the land under it and filled the
crafts hall with trash. With the opening of the Aswan High Dam, the
water table rose, eroding the earthen foundations. The people who
live in New Gourna now say that Fathy's houses do not meet their
needs. They see no charm in communal wells and prefer running
water. Instead of courtyards, they want as many enclosed rooms as
possible to house their extended families. The mud bricks crack in
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few families make do in the original houses. ``We are
poor,'' explained one homeowner, Latafat Omar Ibrahim, ``so we kept
it like Hassan Fathy built it.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Fathy understood the utopian nature of his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most poor people envy the rich and try to copy the possessions
of the rich,'' he wrote. ``Therefore when a peasant gets enough
money to build a house, he often builds a copy _ cheaper and
nastier in every way _ of the houses of the local rich, which in
their turn are copied from the villas of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The relentless paving over of farmland and suburban gardens
around Cairo in recent decades stands as further proof of Fathy's
assessment. Unable to build on his New Gourna experience, he left
Egypt in 1957 to work with the Athens firm of Constantine Doxiades,
which was trying to meld aesthetics and environment.
</P>
<P>
   He returned home six years later but was considered a pariah in
a profession that was tied at the time to didactic schools of
modernist thought that identified progress with all that was new,
Western and industrial.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition of Fathy's archives makes his iconoclastic
position clear. It includes his souvenir program from a visit to
Notre Dame du Haut at Ronchamps, France, the masterwork of the
modernist Le Corbusier. On the program is a quotation from Le
Corbusier, ``I wanted to create a place of silence, of peace, of
interior joy.'' Next to the word ``silence'' Fathy had added his
own comment, ``which shouts.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the end of the 1960s that Fathy's ideas about
humanizing the housing for the poor began to gain currency
internationally. His book, originally written in the '50s, was
published in English, and his work was showcased at the U.N.
Habitat conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is really most influential for is his attempt to find
a reconciliation of the ideals of modern architecture and the
conditions of the developing world, in particular those of the very
poor,'' said William J. Mitchell, dean of the school of
architecture and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Fathy's only venture in the United States was the 1981
construction of Dar al-Islam, a mosque and housing complex in
Abiquiu, N.M., where he studied native materials and designs for
the domed adobe structures. In his final years he watched as the
superficial elements of his style _ the vaults, the inward-facing
compounds, the domes, the Nubian friezes _ became the leitmotif of
new air-conditioned tourist resorts in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who valued the authentic above all other artistic
values, it must have been a strange anticlimax. ``He never bought
the aesthetic of the machine or extreme materialism or
functionalism,'' said Abdelhalim. ``He was a man who did not betray
his eyes, what his eyes saw in the truth and power of local
cultures.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CLEAVES ACHIEVES A SLIVER OF THE DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The day before Monday night's national
championship game against Florida, Tom Izzo, the Michigan State
coach, made one of the more startling statements of the tournament.
He said Mateen Cleaves, his senior point guard, was as significant
to Michigan State basketball as Magic Johnson had been.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows arched. Magic was one of the great point guards in
National Basketball Association history. Magic transformed the
position. Magic and Larry Bird crystallized the melting-pot nature
of college basketball and carried that goodwill into the pro game
right when the National Basketball Association really needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo wasn't saying that Cleaves was as good as Magic. He was
saying that Cleaves was as significant to the Spartans in the late
1990s as Johnson was in the late 70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's only one Magic,'' Izzo said. ``I just think
that Mateen Cleaves has been the next closest thing because of his
personality, because of his will to win. A lot of players have it,
but Mateen shares it with everybody. He is the reason we are a
great family. Great players make all the people around then better.
They might take them from good to great, from average to good. For
us, Mateen makes our coaching staff better, he makes our players
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo knew that if Michigan State was to win its first
championship since Johnson led them in 1979, Cleaves would have to
be everything Izzo said he was.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves came to Michigan State as a highly-touted
football-basketball player from nearby Flint, a city that has
turned out a large number of outstanding high school, college and
professional athletes. Each season has been better than the one
before, from an injury-riddled freshman year when the Spartans went
to the National Invitational Tournament, to a better sophomore
season, to last year's run to the Final Four, which ended with a
semifinal loss to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves said his freshman season set the tone for the rest of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lowest point in my career was when we went to the NIT,''
Cleaves said. ``There's nothing wrong with that tournament, but
just to sit back and watch TV and watch these teams in the NCAA
tournament, to see all the media, watching how much fun they were
having, seeing the smiles of guys, then watching the Final Four. I
promised myself back then: `I'm going to play in that NCAA
tournament; I'm not going to the NIT anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   So how good is Cleaves, really? Is he NBA caliber? He certainly
isn't the traditional player with obvious gifts. He doesn't have a
terrifying shot or an unstoppable penetration move. At 6 feet 1
inch, Cleaves is more likely to be posted up than post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a guy that wanted the stats, never been a guy
who wanted the accolades,'' he said. ``I just want to win. Whatever
you do, win. A lot of guys tease me a lot, they say I cheat when we
play cards, but I just want to win. The name of the game is win.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Wisconsin last Saturday, Cleaves' line was atrocious: 1
point. NBA personnel who watched the game weren't deterred. Chris
Wallace, the Boston Celtics general manager, is a Cleaves fan.
``You look at his statistics against Wisconsin _ nothing to be
excited about _ but they won and he played a key role in them
winning,'' Wallace said. ``He is a tremendous leader, has excellent
intangibles and he has a hardened, winning edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace called Cleaves the 2000 version of Quinn Buckner.
Buckner, without spectacular individual talent, led Indiana to a
national championship in 1976 and as a 10-year pro was known as a
tough, sound point guard who brought a compilation of skills to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sum exceeds his parts,'' Wallace said of Cleaves. ``He's a
big assist guy, he defends his position well and runs the break
well. His offense can come and go, but they don't always need him
to score. At the draft, people will get excited about his
leadership and his intangibles. He has a presence about him. He
makes other people better. When teammates look at him in crucial
situations, they don't see panic, they see composure. I think he's
going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cleaves decided to pass up the NBA for his senior year in
college, the decision was hailed as a shining example of school
winning out over money. The truth is that Cleaves, unlike Magic,
who left Michigan State after his sophomore year, was not ready for
the NBA _ not necessarily because of his physical skills, but
because of his maturity. There were silly mistakes still to be made
and Cleaves made them. Fortunately for him, he made his mistakes in
the forgiving context of a college campus. There wasn't one huge
scandal but a succession of minor incidents: He was stopped with an
unopened can of beer in the car. He played music loudly in his
apartment, ignoring requests to turn it down until he finally
received a citation. He stepped into a brawl rather than walk away
from it after learning that his friend was involved.
</P>
<P>
   But college, aside from being a factory that produces great
athletes, is also where young people make blunders. For Chris
Wallace, who spent a large part of his life analyzing the process
by which young athletes travel the pipeline from high school to
college to the pros, Cleaves is one of the success stories.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, he said, despite some pitfalls, has ended up at the
other side of the pipeline. ``He's where he's supposed to be,''
Wallace said. ``He's where everyone thought he would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves has grown; some of the rough edges have been smoothed.
He's not the same person or the same player that came to college
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves is better.

   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ The heart operation taking place in the
pale-green tiled operating room at the Ohio State University
Medical Center was almost eerie. The patient, a 62-year-old man,
was anesthetized, swathed with blue drapes and lying face up on a
narrow table. But no one was touching him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose
three metal arms protruded through pencil-size holes in the man's
chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers,
with rotating wrists, that held a minuscule instrument, a light and
a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr.
Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer console in a corner of the
operating room about 20 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what
may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass
surgery began nearly 40 years ago. ``The reason we make incisions
is that we have big hands,'' said Wolf, the director of minimally
invasive cardiac surgery at Ohio State. The robot's dainty fingers,
no longer than a nail on a pinkie, at the end of the long sticks
could eliminate that constraint.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by
robots whose arms are inserted through pencil-sized holes punched
in patients' chests. Instead of directly peering into a patient's
body, surgeons will view magnified images of the operation on
computer screens. In theory, the doctor would not have to be in the
same room, or even the same country, as the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a doctor commonly makes a footlong incision in a patient's
chest, saws the breastbone, breaks the ribs to make the holes
bigger, then uses a heart-lung machine so the heart can be stopped,
often at great risk, for repair.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors have already been operating through tiny holes in
the abdomen to do gallbladder surgery or gynecological surgery,
with what is known as laparoscopy, or in the knee, with
arthroscopy, or in the chest, with thoracoscopy, these operations
involve removing or working on large body structures. They do not
involve microsurgery, which involves cutting and sewing minute
blood vessels and other tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors discovered that they simply could not perform the
delicate movements of microsurgery without making large incisions
and putting their hands directly in patients' bodies. Robots could
allow them to get around that restriction. Surgeons say that while
there is intense interest in doing heart bypass surgery with
robots, the methods also could be used for other kinds of
microsurgery, like sewing fallopian tubes or working on blood
vessels in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors caution, however, that robotic surgery has barely begun.
The patient at Ohio State was part of a scientific study to
determine whether one part of a heart bypass operation _ cutting
away an artery in the chest to be used to reroute blood around a
blockage in a coronary artery _ can be done as well with the robot
as with a surgeon's hands. In this study, the doctors open a small
porthole in the patient's chest after the robot cuts the artery and
use their hands to sew the artery onto the beating heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, surgeons say, there is a danger in overselling
the technique before it can be systematically tested, especially
since the work is being supported by two small robot companies
that, even surgeons involved acknowledge, have financial pressures
to be upbeat and enthusiastic. One, Intuitive Surgical, in Mountain
View, Calif., is trying to go public. The other, Computer Motion
Inc., of Goleta, Calif, went public in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and other surgeons who are doing the operations say they
have no stock or stock options, and no direct financial stake in
the companies. Still, they confess they are a bit nervous about the
mix of business and science. ``We're going to proceed in an orderly
fashion, with no cowboys,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and others stress that today's robots are not yet good
enough to take over most heart surgery. The machines cost about $1
million dollars and are suitable only for the 15 percent of
patients who have just one blocked coronary artery, in the front of
their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, ``we have created the world's most expensive,
least applicable procedure,'' said Dr. Ralph Damiano Jr., chief of
cardiothoracic surgery at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in
Hershey Park, Pa., where he does robotic surgery. ``We have taken
the first steps on a long road.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert E. Michler, who does robotic surgery at Ohio State,
where he is is chief of cardiothoracic surgery and transplantation,
agreed. ``I call this the Model T of surgical robotic technology,''
he said. ``By no means is this the final answer.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the doctors say, the still-primitive technology shows them
that robotic surgery has a dazzling potential. ``Nobody has ever
seen anything like this before,'' Wolf said. ``It's elegant, it's
beautiful, it's truly awe inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and others who are testing the procedure in the United
States have also done it in Germany, where less-stringent
government regulations have allowed them to do entire bypasses with
robots. So, they say, they know it can succeed in simple cases.
</P>
<P>
   The promise is that robots will enable heart surgeons to fulfill
their longstanding dream of less invasive, less traumatic
operations. Bypass surgery is indisputably effective. When surgeons
use the mammary artery in the chest to bypass a blockage, the
results usually last for a decade. But it is not easy for the
patients.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With bypass surgery, surgeons typically saw into the patient's
breastbone and crack open the ribs, making a hole just below the
neck to just above the navel. Even worse, surgeons said, are the
heart-lung machines, which allow doctors to operate on a still,
bloodless heart. The machine's plastic tubing elicits an
inflammatory response and the medications that are used to prevent
the blood from clotting in the machine can cause bleeding problems
and organ damage.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 percent of patients have strokes and as many as a third
have measurable memory loss, including an inability to perform
simple mental tasks like calculations and figure recognition. Many
patients also suffer depression after bypass surgery with
heart-lung machines.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to open a blocked artery is to thread a tiny balloon
into the blood vessel and inflate it, pushing the blockage against
the artery wall, and then holding the artery open with a stent, a
tiny metal cage. But not every blockage can be opened with a
balloon, and the method can be less effective than bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Heart surgeons have spent a decade trying to make bypass surgery
less injurious. A few began doing simple cases without heart-lung
machines, operating on beating hearts. By pushing down on a part of
the heart to hold it steady, doctors can sometimes sew a blood
vessel onto a heart that is still beating.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, doctors had another idea. Why not punch small
holes into the chest and insert instruments that are attached to
long sticks? They could operate without making large incisions and
breaking patients' ribs. But the task proved daunting. This sort of
microsurgery, which had proved so successful in other operations,
was not working in the heart, where precise and delicate movements
were impossible with the long sticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like holding the end of an 18-inch pencil and trying to
write your name,'' Damiano said.
</P>
<P>
   It was even difficult to see inside the patient's chest. ``You
worked with a camera and you had someone else hold the camera,''
Damiano said. ``An analogy was if you went to a baseball game and
someone else was holding your head the whole time. Any time you
wanted to make a move, you had to tell them to move your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons, trying to sew together blood vessels about the
size of a strand of spaghetti with thread thinner than a human
hair, finally gave up. ``It is beyond the limits of human
dexterity,'' Damiano said.
</P>
<P>
   Robotic surgery was born out of this experience. The companies
worked on methods for doctors to do heart surgery through small
holes in the patient's chest, but with a computer controlling the
movements of the long sticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking a computer chip and putting it between a
surgeon's hands and the tip of an instrument,'' said Dr. Michael
Mack, director of the Cardiopulmonary Research Science Technology
Institute in Dallas. ``You can scale up or scale down motion. If it
is a 4 to 1 scale, for every four centimeters you move your hands,
the tip of the instrument moves one centimeter. You can make a
movement as precise as you want it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it took time to learn the technique. Mack, for example,
spent three and a half years perfecting his performance in the
laboratory. ``You set up a box and do simple things, like learning
how to tie knots,'' he said. ``Then you get a mannequin and work on
that. You get a pig from the slaughter house and you practice on
that.'' After doing more than 100 bypass operations on pigs and
mannequins, Mack went to Germany to try it on patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it was a big deal,'' Mack said. ``But I wouldn't have
done it if I didn't think it was going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The robots are approved for marketing in Germany (in the United
States they cannot be approved until the testing is complete), and
surgeons there and elsewhere in Europe are learning to use them.
Like Mack, the other doctors using robots in the clinical trials in
the United States also go to Germany, where they do entire bypass
operations with robots.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is still limited. In order to use a robot to
bypass more than one blockage in a coronary artery, to avoid using
a heart-lung machine and to work on an artery other than the one at
the front of the heart, scientists have to figure out methods of
getting at the sides and the back of a beating heart. If they do
not split open the chest, there is very little room to maneuver,
even for a robot's tiny fingers and slender arms.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge is to make robotic operations easier. Even
seemingly minor issues like where to poke the holes in the chest
for the robot arms can be problematic. Wolf said that when he first
began doing robotic surgery, the robot's arms would be too close
together and would bump into each other. Blood vessels differ from
patient to patient, so, for now, positioning the holes is more a
matter of practice and experience than of following a formula.
</P>
<P>
   But those who are testing the robotic systems find their
imaginations soaring. Wolf envisions doing heart surgery on
patients in another state or even another country, controlling the
robot from as far away as he pleases, while other surgeons stand
by. Michler said that the tiny robot fingers and the precision of
its movements could make it ideal for doing heart surgery on
fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Urschel, a professor of thoracic and cardiovascular
surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in
Dallas, said that the computer, which corrects automatically for
tremors in a surgeon's hands, would allow older doctors to operate.
``This is going to make you just as good when you're 80 as you were
when you were 25,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, surgeons caution that robotic surgery
will take time to develop and perfect and that there is a real
danger in promising too much too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that ultimately robotics are going to be a
significant contribution to surgery,'' Mack said. ``But I think
there is a 5- to 10-year time line. My concern is that in the
enthusiastic push, in the unbridled enthusiasm, that everyone gets
caught up in the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``The push is good _ otherwise progress will never get made,''
Mack said. But he added that he was worried that people would
expect too much too soon, and then would lash out against the
robotic systems when they failed to immediately fulfill unrealistic
expectations. ``But I am concerned that things not get trashed,''
Mack said

SPORTS COLUMN: MOTHER'S DAY ARRIVES EARLY FOR METS' BELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The schedule said Monday was opening day at Shea
Stadium, but it was really Mother's Day. Only Derek Bell didn't
send his mother a card. None of that sappy Hallmark stuff for him.
No overpriced flowers either; let the roses wilt. No, Derek Bell
gave his mother a unique present and he sent it special delivery.
</P>
<P>
   With Chestine Bell in the stands, the Mets' new right fielder
hit a tie-breaking eighth-inning home run that produced a 2-1
victory over the San Diego Padres. It was probably the most
thoughtful present for an athlete's parent since Mark McGwire hit
his 61st home run in 1998 on his father's 61st birthday, with his
father in the stands in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to all of the opening games,'' Mrs. Bell, a resident of
Tampa, Fla., said in the Mets' dugout after the game. ``This is the
first time he hit a home run and won the game. That's exciting. I
got chills.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell is one of the new members of the Mets. He came to them as a
required throw-in with Mike Hampton, the 22-game winner the Mets
wanted for the No. 1 spot in their starting rotation. The Houston
Astros wanted to shed Bell's $5 million salary and told the Mets in
no uncertain terms, you want Hampton, you take Bell. Steve
Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said okay.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steve Phillips called me,'' Bell said, ``I told him you
got the good end of the deal because they gave me away. You got a
guy who can steal bases for you, a guy who will get some RBIs,
produce runs, play some good defense, throw some guys out and is a
great guy in the clubhouse and a great team player. So I told him,
`hey, you got a good deal to throw in Derek Bell.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bell was expendable to the Astros not only because of his salary
and his status as a potential free agent after the season but also
because he had the worst season of his eight-year career last year.
His .236 batting average, 12 home runs and 66 runs batted in did
not bode well for the future, the Astros felt.
</P>
<P>
   Playing down his injury-interrupted season, Bell said: ``The
first time I had struggled in nine years and people were writing me
off. It was like I had done this for a couple years. I just had an
off year. There was nothing wrong with my year last year. I told
myself there's nothing wrong with you, just come here and relax and
have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Phillips was detailing the reasons he thought
the Mets had a better team than last year, when they won 97 games
and the wild-card spot in the National League playoffs. ``We're
expecting Derek Bell to bounce back a little bit,'' he said, citing
one of his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Chestine Bell did not travel to Japan to see her son play his
first game with the Mets. Their North American opener would be good
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom hasn't missed an opener of mine since I've been in the
big leagues,'' Bell said. ``Jeff Bagwell teased me last year. He
said you never do bad in front of your mom, and today I did well.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped to the plate to face Donne Wall with two out in
the eighth inning of the 1-1 game, Bell looked into the stands
behind home plate. ``When she's here,'' he related later, ``I
always look at her each and every at bat. I look at her and she
says, `Hey, let's go.'''
</P>
<P>
   In this particular instance, Bell said, he wanted to keep the
inning going by getting on base ahead of Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike
Piazza. ``I wanted to draw a walk or get a good pitch and drive
it,'' he said. If he had reached base, he had planned to steal,
putting into effect another of his attributes.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no need to steal. Bell got a good pitch and drove
it over the left-field fence. Stepping on home plate, he pointed to
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I do something I point to her, especially when I
hit a home run,'' said Bell, whose father left when he was 10 years
old. ``It's just been me and my mom for the past 21 years. She's my
mom and my dad, my girl friend, my wife. She's everything to me.
People know how special me and my mom are and how much she means to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' faithful let Bell know what he meant to them at that
particular moment Monday. They saluted him with a thunderous
ovation and demanded a curtain call, something he had never
experienced in Toronto, San Diego or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' he said, still savoring the moment,
``unbelievable.''

WHEN BELL ATLANTIC AND GTE MERGE, THEY WILL EMERGE AS VERIZON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trying to trade their somewhat musty images for that
of a young technology dynamo, Bell Atlantic and GTE said Monday
that they would call their combined company Verizon after their
merger deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would create the No. 1 local telephone carrier in the
nation. Executives from both companies said the old names carried
too much baggage from the days of slow-moving communications
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that we need to separate ourselves on a
going-forward basis from the tradition and the limited perspective
that a Bell name assigns to us,'' said Bruce S. Gordon, the Bell
Atlantic executive who is set to become president of the combined
company's retail unit. ``We set out to find a global image and a
high-tech image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be dynamic, cutting-edge, fast, customer-focused,
entrepreneurial, youthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon would not say how much Bell Atlantic was spending to
develop and promote the new brand.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic emerged from the breakup of the old American
Telephone and Telegraph Co. in 1984 as the local phone monopoly for
much of the mid-Atlantic region. Shortly after passage of the
deregulatory Telecommunications Act of 1996, Bell Atlantic agreed
to acquire the Nynex Corp., which served many areas from New York
to Maine. After that deal was completed, the Nynex brand
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The GTE brand has its genesis in 1935, with the organization of
the General Telephone Corp. After that company merged with Sylvania
in 1955, the company became known as General Telephone and
Electric. Not until the 1970s did the company call itself GTE.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of their history, brands like Bell Atlantic and GTE
may seem a bit quaint, especially in the face of companies with
futuristic-sounding names like Cisco and Lucent. After agreeing to
acquire IXC Communications Inc. last year, Cincinnati Bell decided
to rename itself Broadwing.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and GTE said Monday that Verizon was derived from
the word horizon and the Latin word for truth, veritas.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and GTE expect to complete the merger, which was
announced in 1998, by the end of June. The companies announced the
Verizon name Tuesday as Bell Atlantic completed a deal to fold its
United States wireless communications unit into a joint venture
with Vodafone Airtouch PLC of Britain. That venture is to be called
Verizon Wireless.

   WASHINGTON _ Here are seven possible outcomes that could
eventually result from Monday's ruling that Microsoft violated
antitrust laws:
</P>
<P>
   1. Microsoft is split into two or more separate companies. One
of them would market Windows, the firm's flagship product, while
another would sell its suite of applications, such as Word. Yet a
third company might be formed to offer Internet-based content and
services.
</P>
<P>
   2. Microsoft is split into several equal-sized entities,
popularly known as ``Baby Bills'' after chairman Bill Gates.
Initially, at least, each of the newly formed rivals would sell the
same software and products while competing against each other on
price and quality of service.
</P>
<P>
   3. Microsoft is broken up into several firms that target
different market segments. Under this plan, one such successor
company could tailor its products to consumers while another might
focus on large business customers. To ensure uniformity, a separate
company also could be formed to guarantee that divergent flavors of
Windows can still run the same basic applications.
</P>
<P>
   4. Microsoft is required to license Windows to its rivals. These
companies would then be free to market enhanced Windows clones that
would compete against Microsoft's ``classic'' version.
</P>
<P>
   5. Microsoft is required to provide detailed programming
``hooks'' into Windows to help its rivals compete. By opening up
the ``source code,'' they would become free to extend the Windows
operating system into such new areas as ``smart'' browsers, voice
or touch-screen commands, and next-generation audio and video
services.
</P>
<P>
   6. Microsoft is forced to ship a version of Windows that strips
away its built-in Internet browser. It could also be obliged to
offer other Windows versions that feature competing browsers.
</P>
<P>
   7. Microsoft is made to change its business practices. One
possibility: It would be barred from striking exclusive licensing
deals or required to publish a price list for its software and
services that would offer all comers the same deal, calling a halt
to current preferences.

   MEXICO CITY _ If any company represents the marriage of Mexico
and modern business, it is Telefonos de Mexico, the
telecommunications giant that towers over its industry at home and
is the Mexican stock that Wall Street investors love to own.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was sold by the government a decade ago to a private
sector consortium headed by Carlos Slim Helu, now Latin America's
wealthiest man, Telmex more than any other enterprise has
symbolized Mexico's passage from an inward-looking state-controlled
economy to a thriving globalized free market. And since Telmex,
once a monopoly, was forced to face competition in both long
distance and recently in local service, the government has touted
the opening as an example of its commitment to free trade and
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   But American companies that took Mexico at its word and tried to
challenge Telmex in long distance say they have hit a wall raised
by a powerful conglomerate that presses many lingering monopoly
advantages and subdues the regulators who are supposed to impose
discipline. The clash has forged an improbable alliance between two
of the biggest telephone players in the United States, AT&AMP;T and
MCIWorldcom, which find themselves underdogs in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released on Friday, the U.S. trade representative,
Charlene Barshefsky, said she was ``seriously concerned'' about
what she called regulatory failures in Mexico. She also said Telmex
is inhibiting the creation of competition in the telecommunications
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because Telmex is the flagship of Mexico's privatizations, its
apparent reluctance to play on a level field, and the soft-spoken
approach of Mexican regulators to the problem, have cast a shadow
on President Ernesto Zedillo's often stated pledge to honor
open-border economics.
</P>
<P>
   Telmex also has provided a close view of Slim's style of
business. As a financier he is an acknowledged master of bargain
spotting and management turnaround, recently demonstrated by his
purchase of Prodigy, a foundering American Internet service
provider that he transformed in two years into a booming Latin
American Web channel. But his competitors say that in Telmex, the
heart of his empire, Slim has proven to be a hardball tactician who
exploits the edge afforded by the company's holdover monopoly
status.
</P>
<P>
   Telmex officials reject suggestions that the company does not
play fair. They attribute their long-distance competitors'
hardships to inexpert management and inexperience with the Mexican
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made concession after concession to create a healthy
market,'' said Arturo Elias Ayub, a senior Telmex official who is
the company spokesman. ``But they are never happy. They always want
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Telmex and top regulators argue that Mexico has opened up
to telecommunications competition at record speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the progress of regulation and the penetration of the
competitors, our opening compares very favorably with other
countries,'' said Jorge Nicolin, director of the Federal
Telecommunications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a dispute between a leading Mexican company and
foreign interlopers, although it often appears that way in the
Mexican press. While Slim and a small group of Mexican investors
control 51 percent of Telmex, the remainder is evenly divided
between SBC Internationa, a subsidiary of SBC Communications, and
France Telecom. Avantel, MCI Worldcom's long-distance company in
Mexico, is 55 percent-owned by Grupo Financiero Banacci, a large
Mexican bank. AT&AMP;T holds 49 percent its Mexican affiliate Alestra,
while 51 percent is split between Grupo Alfa, a Mexican
manufacturing conglomerate, and Bancomer, another large Mexican
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation is, however, between an alliance of newcomers
to Mexico's telecommunications industry and Slim, an established
figure with a broad hold on Mexican business. Slim's properties now
account for more than half of Mexico's stock market.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of competition, Telmex still has about 75
percent of the $4.4 billion long-distance market while eight
competitors share the rest. Avantel and Alestra each have about 10
percent. Between them, they have invested more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The core dispute is over the cost of linking calls from Telmex's
local lines to the competitors' long-distance networks. The cost of
these connections has continued to rise while the rates companies
charge have slid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught us in a pincer action,'' said Francisco Gil Diaz,
the chief operating officer of Avantel. Both Avantel and Alestra
said they pay about 60 percent of their revenue directly to Telmex.
</P>
<P>
   Connection costs keep rising because they are pegged by
regulation to inflation. In addition, the smaller companies argue
that the rates they pay to Telmex were set at artificially high
levels by regulators. Mexico pledged, when it first set the rules
for long-distance competition, to promptly bring those rates down,
close to the cost of providing the service. That has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   The competitors contend that Telmex has pushed down rates to its
own customers by subsidizing its long-distance service with the
generous cash flow from its local business and with discounts
written into big commercial contracts.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that Telmex has subjected its competitors to
crippling failures of service. Both Avantel and Alestra rely on
Telmex to provide special high-traffic lines that carry Internet
and corporate data. For nine months after July 1999, Telmex stopped
providing these lines, on the grounds that the competitors had
failed to pay back bills. The Mexican regulator took no effective
action. In January, the Federal Communications Commission levied a
$100,000 fine on Telmex based on the damage to customers in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Gil Diaz said, Telmex disconnected 40 of his best
business customers to force Avantel to pay disputed bills. Two
years ago Avantel tried to introduce a service allowing Mexicans to
make long-distance calls from public phones using prepaid cards.
Telmex refused to give Avantel a free number for the calls to go
through.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolin, the regulator, agreed that the competitors' costs are
too high. But he said that his agency had been restrained from
acting by legal challenges from Telmex.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at least a year after he was expected to act, Nicolin
issued special rules governing Telmex, intended to bring down costs
and improve service.
</P>
<P>
   Elias, the spokesman, said Telmex will ``fight very hard'' in
the courts against the regulator's new rules, which were designed
``to tie Telmex's hands and feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectation when we made our investment was that the
regulator would enforce the regulations,'' said Frank Voytek,
AT&AMP;T's representative on Alestra's board.

CLINTON STUMPS FOR CHINESE TRADE PACT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ President Clinton took his lobbying campaign
for a decisive Chinese trade agreement to Silicon Valley on Monday
and rallied the support of high-tech executives as he made the case
that China cannot resist the liberalizing influences of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question China has been trying to crack down on the
Internet,'' Clinton said. ``Good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the Chinese leadership clearly understands how
the Internet age may ``threaten the old order,'' and this is
``proof that we should keep going in this direction, not that we
should hold back.''
</P>
<P>
   As he tries to sway reluctant House members in both parties to
clear the way for China to enter the World Trade Organization,
Clinton received Monday what his aides have been seeking for weeks:
a congressional commitment to hold a vote on a bill granting China
permanent normal trade relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, said Monday that
the House would take up the legislation by May 29, when the House
breaks for a weeklong recess for Memorial Day. The bill faces
easier prospects of passage in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also praised the support of the governors of 40 of the
50 states, plus Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Somoa.
From the high-tech industry, he released a letter from nearly 200
chief executive officers who are backing the trade agreement,
including those at Microsoft, Compaq, Lucent Technologies and
Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   These executives said in a letter to lawmakers that giving China
upgraded trade status is ``the most critical vote you will make in
support of our high technology industries this year.'' The United
States promised to work to grant China permanent trading rights as
part of a sweeping trade accord it negotiated as part of China's
effort to join the trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   White House vote counters say the outcome could still go either
way in the House, depending on the decisions of scores of
uncommitted lawmakers in both parties. To sway them, Clinton is
focusing on Democrats in safe seats who are close to the high-tech
industry and can resist the entreaties of labor unions, many of
which have sharply criticized the trade measure as detrimental to
the interests of American workers.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has also sought to generate support among
members of Congress who represent districts with heavy agricultural
interests because the trade accord frees up trade in many farm
products.
</P>
<P>
   A vote in May, backers say, would allow the issue to be decided
before the arguments become bogged down in the national political
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Monday at the Tech Museum of Innovation, Clinton said:
``This vote by Congress is on an agreement that lowers no American
trade barriers, lowers no American tariffs, grants no greater
access to China to any part of the American economy _ nothing, zip,
zilch, nada, zero. On the other hand, Chinese tariffs will fall by
more than half over five years in every sector _ from
telecommunications to automobiles to agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the deal received an import new convert Monday: Rep.
Zoe Lofgren, of San Jose, a leader in the House Democrats' outreach
effort to the burgeoning high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free markets cannot prosper in authoritarian regimes, and in a
global world authoritarian regimes cannot waltz by the impact of
freedom and free markets,'' said Lofgren, who had been undecided on
the issue and was being pressured by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised her statement of support as ``a brave
announcement'' and urged other lawmakers to follow her lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do this, 20 years from now we will wonder why we ever
had a serious debate about it,'' Clinton said. ``If we don't do it,
20 years from now we'll still be kicking ourselves for being so
dumb. And there is no point in my being delicate about this. I
think this is a big deal.''

&HT;     CONSERVATIVE GROUP URGES DISMANTLING OF CENSUS BUREAU 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A conservative legal organization urged Congress
Monday to dismantle the U.S. Census Bureau, claiming that the 2000
survey violates people's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, which won a
Supreme Court decision last year limiting the Census Bureau's use
of statistical sampling, proposed that lawmakers create two
agencies to replace the bureau in order to make the head count
simpler and less invasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government [is] trying to extort very personal information
out of private individuals under the threat of prosecution,''
foundation president Matthew Glavin said at a news conference here.
``We've made the process too complex.''
</P>
<P>
   His group said one new agency would send a postcard to every
household asking only how many people live in that residence. A
second agency would collect more in-depth population data similar
to that in the current 53-question census long form.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies would report to Congress and neither could
threaten people who fail to respond with prosecution. Currently
those who don't reply face a fine up to $100.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin contended that the single-question postcard census would
accomplish the constitutionally required decennial head count more
accurately and would boost the number of mailed responses.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, 55 percent of Americans had responded to the
census. The bureau has set a minimum goal of 61 percent and a
maximum target of 70 percent before Census officials begin making
house calls to non-respondents on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 vote early last year, the Supreme Court agreed with the
foundation and ruled against President Clinton's plan to use
statistical sampling to supplement the mailed-response data in
order to reduce the number of citizens undercounted by the Census.
The 1990 census had undercounted 8.4 million people and overcounted
4.4 million others.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of sampling to complete the head count, the high court
said, the Census Bureau must count every citizen individually, as
mandated by the Constitution, in apportioning congressional seats
among the states.
</P>
<P>
   However, it also said the statistical method may be used for
other purposes such as allocating billions of federal dollars for
various programs among the states.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based, tax-exempt Southeastern Legal Foundation,
which calls itself a public interest law firm that advocates
limited government, is funded privately by individuals, charitable
foundations and corporations. It has also filed a complaint with
the Arkansas Supreme Court seeking to have Clinton disbarred.
</P>
<P>
   A Census Bureau official, asked for comment on the foundation's
proposals, said all questions on the census form are there for
valid legal reasons and are important in allocating federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Walker, communications director for the House Subcommittee
on the Census, encouraged people to answer every question. He said
the subcommittee will hold hearings in the next couple of months
and may eliminate the long form. But he said the debate over it now
may serve only to diminish mail-in response.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks several Republican leaders have objected to
census questions that some of their constituents had complained
about, particularly those on the long form, which was mailed to one
in six American households.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, said last week he might not answer all of the
questions on the long form if it were mailed to him. And Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., encouraged people to leave
blank any questions they felt invaded their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin said Monday he would fill out only his address and the
number of people living in his home on a census form although he
urged others to answer every question. He explained in an interview
that while he disapproves of the Census Bureau's methods, he
recognizes ``the value of these questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavin blamed Congress for the current privacy controversy,
noting that the lawmakers were given the census questions in 1998
and were asked to list any objections. He noted that Congress
accepted the questionnaire as submitted.

GLOVES COME OFF IN DISCUSSION OVER RACISM IN THE MEDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Six years after the demise of apartheid, South
Africa has begun a long-deferred conversation about race, the issue
that has defined this country for 350 years.
</P>
<P>
   The gloves are off.
</P>
<P>
   Propelling an increasingly rancorous public debate are hearings
on racism in the media that resumed Monday before the South African
Human Rights Commission after a three-week break. On the surface,
the inquiry seems to be an aggressive encroachment on press
freedoms. At one point, editors were threatened with jail time if
they refused to answer questions about what they published, and
some of those who have testified have faced rigorous cross
examination.
</P>
<P>
   But at a deeper level, the hearings reveal the confusion of a
society emerging from a brutal, bigoted past. In the arena of
democracy, where the rules of conduct are no longer color-coded by
the state, relations among black and white South Africans are
becoming muddier and angrier. Once the term for a clearly defined
social illness, ``racism'' now serves as a catch-all invective, a
ready retort in any dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The media hearings are ``symptomatic of the way race operates in
this society: as an object of denial by whites and a bludgeon by
black politicians and interest groups,'' said Steven Friedman,
director of the Center for Policy Studies: ``Whites tend to say,
unless they are pushed, that there is no issue here. Apartheid is
gone, the problem is solved. On the black side, race becomes a way
of achieving other objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela, sought
racial healing in the early years after apartheid. Differences were
played down in an attempt to build a new, national identity based
on a love of land rather than color of skin. But old imbalances
remain: Most blacks live in poverty, while whites still wield
significant influence over business, the civil service, and the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Under Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor, ``transformation'' has
replaced ``reconciliation'' as the watchword of government. Blacks
are clamoring for more control across the socioeconomic spectrum,
while whites struggle to retain rank and privilege. This
increasingly charged environment has exacerbated unresolved racial
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Race dominates radio talks shows. It is the focus of a new play
by the Afrikaans poet Antjie Krog that pits a black woman against a
white woman in a bitter dialogue that _ perhaps ominously _ reaches
no conclusion. Affirmative action is altering the workforce and
professional sport. Parliament has held debates on racism. Mbeki
called for a national summit on the issue to be held this year.
</P>
<P>
   With the media hearings, race has become a singular national
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of dissatisfaction about race on all
sides,'' said Njonjo Mue, an advocate of press freedoms at Article
19, an international media watchdog organization in Johannesburg.
``Now everyone gets a chance to talk about it. The media just
reflect what a society is all about, and these are issues that need
to be debated.''
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry into racism in the media started when a black lawyer
took issue in late 1998 with newspaper reports accusing her client
of corruption. She rallied her black colleagues, who lodged a
collective complaint with the Human Rights Commission. The panel
ordered a sweeping investigation of all media and found widespread
evidence supporting the lawyers' claim.
</P>
<P>
   In February, subpoenas were served on more than 30 editors
around the country. The summonses were repealed following an
international outcry, and the panel then ``invited'' editors to
make submissions in public hearings starting last month.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the panel wanted to find out whether and how
journalists, either wittingly or otherwise, perpetuated negative
racial stereotypes. One question prevailed: Do press freedoms
collide with South Africa's constitutional right to human dignity?
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks at the hearings argued that newspapers promote
racism in their depictions of blacks as victims of AIDS, natural
disasters, political violence, and driving accidents. They said the
media reported more corruption stories about blacks than whites.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip van Niekerk, a respected white editor whose weekly
newspaper, the Mail and Guardian, was heavily criticized for its
investigative reports on black politicians, rejected such findings.
``Misuse of `racism' is increasingly dangerous, given that there
are those who define ours as a black government and then use the
emotionality of the term to prevent its critics from speaking
back,'' he told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of the inquiry, the focus has shifted away
from the content of stories to power in newsrooms. Most black
editors, such as Khulu Sibiya of City Press, told the commission,
``the media is predominantly in the hands of whites. This imbalance
must be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   One consensus has emerged: In a society torn apart by race for
centuries, no institution in South Africa is free of racism, and
the media should be more self-critical. As a journalist, the whole
inquiry makes John Battersby, editor of the Sunday Independent,
uncomfortable. But as a South African, he embraces the arrival of a
broader debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace at which we South Africans will be able to
consolidate our new-found democracy will depend to a large degree
on the pace at which we are able to vanquish racism as a
determining factor in our society,'' he said Monday. ``The debate
has highlighted the importance both of eradicating racism and of
the principle of freedom of expression . . . two sides of the same
coin.''

MATTEL PLANS TO SELL LEARNING CO. AT AN EXPECTED LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mattel Inc. said Monday that it would seek a buyer for the
Learning Co., its educational software unit, which is expected to
fetch only a fraction of the $3.6 billion Mattel paid for it in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Intended to broaden Mattel's reach, the unit has instead
contributed to $300 million in losses, a $7 billion drop in the
company's market valuation and the resignation of Jill Barad as
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of so-called edu-tainment software on CD-ROM have slumped
as consumers have shifted their interest to the Internet and
videogames. And Learning Co.'s core offerings _ like Reader Rabbit
and Carmen San Diego _ are seen as tired entries in a maturing
market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously bought a business they didn't understand, which
was already on a down slope,'' said Michael Perkins, co-author of
``Kidware: The Parents' Guide to Software for Children,'' and an
editor with The Red Herring magazine. ``I don't think they're going
to find a buyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattel said it had retained Credit Suisse First Boston to sell
Learning Co. Control of any Mattel brands will not be part of any
deal, it added. The software business will be treated as a
discontinued operation in Mattel's financial statements effective
March 31, which means that its losses will not effect the company's
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel shares rose 43.75 cents, to $10.9375, on the New York
Stock Exchange. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the
Learning Co. had been put on the block.
</P>
<P>
   The entire educational software business has been through a
sweeping consolidation, with three or four companies now accounting
for most titles, and even those struggling to remain profitable,
said Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of Softletter, an industry
newsletter. ``One of the biggest problems was the virtual collapse
of the retail channel, especially for consumer products,'' he said.
``Computer stores just don't get Main Street traffic and nobody
ever figured out how to get these titles in supermarkets and book
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. that Mattel bought was actually a collection of
once-leading producers of software for children amassed in an
aggressive acquisition spree by Kevin O'Leary and Michael Perik,
founders of a Canadian software company called Softkey
International Inc. Softkey, previously known primarily for
publishing a CD-ROM version of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit
calendar, acquired the original Learning Co. in a hostile takeover
in 1995, and adopted its name.
</P>
<P>
   Softkey also acquired the Minnesota Educational Computing Corp.,
known as MECC, Compton's New Media, and Broderbund Software Inc.,
and pursued a strategy of cutting prices and increasing
distribution. For a time this plan resulted in increased revenue,
but the new ownership also resulted in an exodus of talent, many no
doubt dismayed by O'Leary's oft-quoted remark that creating
software titles was no different from blending new flavors of cat
food.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co.'s revenue growth had already slowed before Mattel
closed its acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   And in August, Perik and O'Leary sold a majority of their Mattel
stock for $5.9 million each. They left the company in November,
after Learning Co. reported a third-quarter loss of $100 million,
pocketing $5.2 million each in severance pay.

SEGA TO SELL ONLINE GAMES ACCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not wanting to be upstaged by recent
announcements from its bigger rivals, Sega says it will start
selling Internet access this fall for the fast-growing number of
young consumers who play video games online.
</P>
<P>
   The service, at $21.95 a month, is unusual for Sega, which is
primarily a video game company. It will pit Sega against
well-established Internet service providers such as America Online
and Earthlink.
</P>
<P>
   Sega executives say they intend to compete with these
juggernauts by promising fast access and minimal delays in ferrying
signals across the Internet. Both are crucial considerations when
players are reacting to split-second moves by opponents who are
miles away, said Greg Chiemingo, vice president of marketing for
Sega.com, a new division focused solely on the exploding online
game market.
</P>
<P>
   Sega's news comes weeks after its much larger rival, Sony Corp.,
introduced the fast-selling PlayStation2 in Japan, and on the heels
of an announcement Microsoft will enter the market in 2001 with its
X-Box machine.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Sega has struggled in the shadow of Sony, which has
consistently claimed 40 percent or more of the video game market.
By the late 1990s, it looked as if Sega had lost the battle. But
with the introduction of its Dreamcast console last year, Sega grew
its market share from a paltry 0.5 percent to 15 percent, according
to International Data Corp. Sega is looking to preserve that
hard-won market share with its move toward playing games online.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from sales of online games is expected to grow from just
2 percent of the game market today to 24 percent in 2002, according
to Forrester Research. Sega isn't alone: Virtually all game
companies are positioning themselves by developing online games and
building modems into their consoles.
</P>
<P>
   But Sega's unusual tactic _ diving into Internet access _ may
prove risky, said analyst Schelley Olhava, of IDC: ``There are so
many reasons why consumers would choose to go with another service
provider. It's a pretty tough business.''

   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ Microsoft was found guilty
Monday of violating anti-trust laws much in the manner that the
coal, steel and oil behemoths did at the dawn of the century.
Monday's verdict by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson was the
government's second resounding victory over Microsoft. It had been
regarded as a virtual certainty since Jackson's findings of fact
last Nov. 5 that Microsoft had used its monopoly powers to strangle
competition and hurt consumers. The question now is what remedies
the judge will propose. They could include curbs on Microsoft's
business practices to a basic restructuring of the 25-year-old
company based in the Seattle area. No one expects a final decision
soon on the company's future. Microsoft has vigorously contested
the suit filed by the Justice Department's Anti-trust Division and
19 states all along, and lengthy appeals are likely, perhaps all
the way to the Supreme Court. By Joel Brinkley.

   MICROSOFT-TECH-STOCKS (New York) _ The Nasdaq stock market, the
source of much of the new wealth created during the 1990s, lost a
big chunk of its market capitalization Monday, recording its
fifth-biggest decline ever. Led by Microsoft, which plunged on news
that efforts to resolve the government's antitrust case against the
company had failed, the Nasdaq composite index plummeted 349.15, or
7.6 percent, and closed at 4223.68. The money flooding out of
Internet and technology stocks did not flee the stock market
completely. Instead, it was redirected into high-quality blue chip
stocks, which a number of analysts have said were undervalued. By

NAME CHANGE, ACQUISITION MARK DAY FOR SOFTWARE MARKETER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rather than place help-wanted ads or hire recruiters,
one software marketing company has decided to expand its work force
by simply buying another firm with related expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Exchange Applications said it is changing its name to
Xchange Inc.; for $52 million in stock, Xchange said, it has also
acquired Knowledge Stream Partners, a private Boston
database-mining company with about $4 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In today's tight job market, Xchange's challenge has been to
find tech-savvy workers who can help it keep pace with its growth.
Last year, sales jumped 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Knowledge Stream was a way to get top talent and added
depth in the company's marketing discipline, said Xchange's chief
executive and founder, Andrew Frawley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a perfect match,'' said Knowledge Stream's
CEO and founder, Robert van der Hooning.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition adds 20 skilled professionals to Xchange's work
force of 300 people, Frawley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relative bargain in the Internet supermarket,'' a
Forrester Research senior analyst, Bob Chatham, said of the
acquisition price. ``They get world-class talent.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when many Nasdaq companies lost heavily, Xchange shares
fell $9.6093 to close at $43.3125, well below a 52-week high of
$74.75 it had reached last week.
</P>
<P>
   Many big corporations collect data about their customers from a
variety of sources, including telemarketing calls, sales purchases,
loyalty programs, and visits to company Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Xchange software lets such clients as Bell Atlantic,
DaimlerChrysler, and Staples Inc. coordinate all this information
and use it to create marketing aimed at individual customers _
based on their expressed preferences and their histories with the
client.
</P>
<P>
   These personalized communications can take the form of e-mail,
direct mail, or telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generated 400 million e-mails last year,'' Frawley said.
``And we generated 2 billion pieces of direct mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Suppose a consumer buys a printer from Staples, and six months
later a search of the Staples database shows that the customer
hasn't bought any toner or paper.
</P>
<P>
   Xchange's software would assume the customer is buying such
products elsewhere and might send e-mail with a $10 discount on
toner, Frawley said.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose the same customer visits the Staples.com Web site;
Xchange software might instantly recognize the customer, and the
coupon for toner might appear as a banner ad on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Many firms offer similar features, but only Xchange has a full
menu of services that let clients do personalized marketing _ both
online and offline _ and track results, Frawley said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge Stream's specialty is using statistical models to make
real-time predictions about a consumer's buying patterns, based on
past dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with such software and expertise, Xchange clients can
``avoid the spam syndrome'' that results when customers are
bombarded with unwanted e-mail, Chatham said. Xchange enables
clients to ``send the right e-mail to the right person with the
right offer at the right time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994, Frawley's company went public in late 1998. It
earned $1.1 million last year, on revenue of $43.3 million. If not
for a 1999 acquisition, profits would have equalled 7 percent of
revenue, Frawley said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Xchange announced an alliance with Engage
Technologies Inc., a CMGI Inc. company in Andover.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: Our company has an award program that is
supposedly linked to our performance. My performance has been in
the award range and I have never gotten one, but other people with
similar performance have been given awards. I told this to my
manager and he said he'd look into it, but nothing ever happened.
What do you suggest? D.F.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Your company's award program is certainly not going to
win any awards. When a company implements a program that is
supposed to link awards to performance, and then doles out awards
on some other basis, the company is asking for real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   This approach not only generates dissatisfaction, dissent and
frustration, it also has the possibility of generating claims in
the equal employment area. For example, some may argue that these
awards are being granted on the basis of such factors as race, sex,
religion or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   If your manager continues to do nothing about this, you should
approach the human resources director if your company has one, or
you should consider approaching a more senior level of management.
In addition to voicing your concern and dissatisfaction, give
management the specific facts that prove that you have earned an
award.
</P>
<P>
   Company management needs to understand that award programs need
clear performance criterion, equitable treatment for all and
validation to be sure that the program is meeting its objectives.
Management also needs to understand that the matter of company
awards can turn into a matter of jury awards.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just completed my second job interview with a company, and
they want me to start working for them immediately. I have been
with my present employer for two years, and I feel it is only right
to give a couple of weeks notice, but I will lose the new job if I
do. M.N.
</P>
<P>
   A: What you are really saying is that unless you go against what
you think is right, ethical and fair, you will lose the new job
opportunity. In this type of situation, there are compelling
arguments on both sides, and you need to make a decision that will
not keep you awake at night.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, in the cold world of business, you are most
likely an ``at will'' employee, and this means that your employer
can let you go pretty much at its own will, provided it does so
within the law. And, some would argue, as long as you can be let go
at the drop of a hat, you can do likewise to the employer. And
further, some employers take the position that when an employee
gives notice, he or she should leave at once.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, if you simply quit, you are failing to
complete an obligation that is important to you, and you may be
burning a bridge. You might be so distressed by doing so that you
can actually resent your new employer and hinder your own
performance and success before you even start.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal will depend on the working relationship with your
present employer, and the actual opportunity being offered by the
potential employer. Something deep within you, however, is saying
that you should not just hit the road. That voice is always worth
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many employers are requesting or even demanding that resumes
include one's salary history. Some ads even say that resumes
without a salary history will not be considered. Why is this demand
being made? A.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: The main reason that employers are saying ``show me the
money'' when they run their ads is a matter of expediency. They
typically use the salary data to screen out applicants who are
either making too much or too little money, thereby allowing the
employers to spend more time with applicants whose pay levels fall
within a predetermined range.
</P>
<P>
   While employers may insist on having this pay data, many
employment counselors advise job applicants to avoid submitting pay
data with one's resume. The idea is to write an impressive resume
and cover letter, and talk about pay levels during an interview. It
is believed that applicants may cause themselves to be
unnecessarily eliminated or ultimately underpaid when they share
pay data at the outset of the screening process.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, from the applicant standpoint, individuals moving
from one geographical area to another may sell themselves short
just because the pay levels were lower in the area that they left.
And further, for applicants who are returning to the labor market
after years of family and volunteer work, pay levels from jobs held
years ago are meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   In today's tight labor market, employers should be doing
everything possible to remove artificial barriers that may prevent
highly qualified individuals from ever becoming applicants.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a quarter of a century, superstring theory has promised that
the universe could be understood more deeply than ever before, with
all the forces unified into one, if it were seen in a startling new
light _ as a kind of mathematical music played by an orchestra of
tiny vibrating strings. Each note in this cosmic symphony would
represent one of the many different kinds of particles that make up
matter and energy.
</P>
<P>
   But despite heroic efforts to keep this strange vision alive,
with one mathematical embellishment after another, a seemingly
fatal credibility problem has remained: no one has been able to
figure out how to test the idea with experiments.
</P>
<P>
   To give the strings enough wiggle room to carry out their
virtuoso performance, theorists have had to supplement the familiar
three dimensions of space with six more _ curled up so tiny that
they would be explorable only with absurdly high-powered particle
accelerators the size of an entire galaxy. It's a fact of life on
the subatomic realm that smaller and smaller distances take higher
and higher energies to probe.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, however, new ideas emerging from the
theoretical workshops offer some hope of connecting the airy
speculations to reality. Physicists are proposing a revised view in
which at least one of the extra dimensions is vastly larger _ large
enough perhaps to be indirectly detected with existing
accelerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a field day for the experimenters,'' said Dr. Joseph
Lykken, a theoretical physicist at Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory in Batavia, Ill. ``Now there are all these things they
can look for.'' In fact, he ventured, it is conceivable that
experimenters have already found subtle hints of other dimensions.
They have just had no way of appreciating what they were seeing.
</P>
<P>
   Though human brains are not wired to picture a world beyond the
familiar three dimensions of space, one can begin to overcome this
myopia by pretending to be antlike creatures in a two-dimensional
fantasy world like the one in Edwin A. Abbott's story ``Flatland.''
Confined to the surface of a plane, the Flatlanders can move left
and right or forward or backward, but the idea of up and down is
inconceivable to them.
</P>
<P>
   Now suppose this two-dimensional world were rolled into a long
tube. The Flatlanders could still move in only two directions _
along or around the outside surface of their soda straw universe.
But if the diameter of the straw were made extremely tiny, this
second, curled-up dimension would essentially disappear.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been assumed that if, as required by superstring
theory, our own world is accompanied by additional dimensions, they
too would have to be extremely tiny, curled up smaller than what
physicists call the Planck length, which is a hundred million
trillion times smaller than the width of a proton. To every point
in space would be attached a vanishingly tiny six-dimensional ball.
</P>
<P>
   But the price for curling up the extra dimensions and tucking
them out of sight has been rendering superstring theory untestable.
The subatomic realm is explored by smashing together particles with
powerful accelerators and then studying the debris. Peeking below
the Planck scale would require collisions of unimaginable energies.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first 25 years, the thinking has been that superstring
theory is so difficult to see experimentally that you have to
figure it out by its own mathematical consistency and beauty,''
Lykken said. ``Now that's completely changed. If this new picture
is true, it makes everything we've been talking about testable.''
</P>
<P>
   But the result is a picture of reality that is no less weird
than before. Imagine again the two-dimensional realm of Flatland.
Suppose now that it is surrounded by an infinitely large,
three-dimensional ``hyperspace.'' And maybe there are also other
Flatlands floating around inside the third dimension _ parallel
universes separated by what to these two-dimensional denizens would
be an uncrossable void.
</P>
<P>
   Take this vision and move up an extra dimension and you arrive
at the theory that is currently causing all the intellectual
commotion. Dr. Lisa Randall of Princeton University and Dr. Raman
Sundrum of Stanford University suggest that what we think of as The
Universe may be just one of many islands _ three-dimensional
versions of Flatland _ floating inside a surrounding megaverse with
four spatial dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Each ruled by different laws of physics, the various island
universes would be inaccessible to one another. But the tantalizing
prospect exists that each would be able to barely sense the other's
presence through the weak tug of its gravitational pull.
</P>
<P>
   The idea may be easy to dismiss as absurd. But in return for a
suspension of disbelief, the new theories suggest answers to some
of the biggest riddles of physics. Cosmologists have inferred that
as much as 90 percent of the universe must be made from invisible
matter that emits or absorbs no light, that is evident only through
its gravity.
</P>
<P>
   But what is the source of this mysterious dark matter? Maybe it
is just ordinary matter trapped on another island universe, with
its gravity but not its light able to cross the fourth-dimensional
divide. Most significant of all, the new theory could be a step
toward the goal of embracing all of physics with one grand picture
_ a vision that unites the reigning theory of gravity, Einstein's
general relativity, with the Standard Model, which describes
electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   Theorists have discovered that it is possible to bring about
this merger _ on paper, anyway _ if each kind of particle making up
the universe is described as a different note produced by tiny
superstrings vibrating in nine-dimensional space. This picture
includes matter-making particles like the proton and neutron
(components of the cores of atoms) and force-carrying particles
like the photon (the conveyor of light) and the graviton (the
conveyor of gravity).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the unification quest has forged ahead, physicists have found
it necessary to expand superstring theory to include vibrating
membranes _ called branes for short. These are not just
two-dimensional surfaces, like the skin of a drum or the world of
the Flatlanders. Hard as it may be to picture, there can be branes
with three, four, five or more dimensions. These ``surfaces'' can
be tiny like the strings but they can also span across light-years.
</P>
<P>
   What this additional filigree offers is a novel way to hide
extra dimensions without making them extremely small. Suppose that
our entire universe is a three-dimensional brane (think of it as a
bubble) floating inside the four-dimensional megaverse.
</P>
<P>
   The reason we cannot explore the surroundings of hyperspace or
even sense its existence is that the strings that make up
everything in our own world are stuck solidly to the surface of the
gargantuan home brane, like ants on a sheet of paper confined to
move in only a limited number of directions. We cannot peer into
the extra dimension because photons, the carriers of light, are
also anchored solidly to our home brane.
</P>
<P>
   Several people had toyed with this idea, but they kept running
into an obstacle: there did not appear to be any way to get
gravitons to stick to the brane. That would create a big problem:
It can be shown mathematically that if gravity were allowed to roam
throughout all four dimensions, it would be much stronger than the
gravity experienced in this three-dimensional realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would clash with everything we've observed, from the
motion of the planets to that of climbers falling off cliffs,''
said Dr. Steve Giddings, a theorist at the University of California
at Santa Barbara. Randall and Sundrum's theoretical coup was to
show that if the hyperspace was curved in just the right manner,
the gravitons could be kept from escaping and becoming unreasonably
strong.
</P>
<P>
   With that hole plugged, the possibility arises that there are
other brane worlds floating out there too, neighboring islands
separated by this higher dimensional void. And that suggests how
dark matter could simply be regular matter waving to us from
another brane.
</P>
<P>
   While its photons could move only along the surface of the
foreign brane, the gravitons would not be so tightly confined. They
could seep across the fourth-dimensional divide. Thus we could
dimly feel the matter's gravity without being able to see its
light.
</P>
<P>
   The theory also suggests why dark matter tends to be found in
the halos around galaxies. Because of gravitational attraction,
large masses on the other brane would tend to line up with large
masses on our home brane. Sitting behind a galaxy in this universe,
separated by the void of hyperspace, would be a dark galaxy in the
other brane world. Because most of it would be occluded, its
gravity would be apparent only around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, luminous matter on this brane would be dark to
observers in the other universe. ``We'd look mutually dark to each
other,'' Sundrum said. ``We could only talk through the
gravitational force.'' That would require signaling somehow with
gravity waves.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of physics' far-out theories, the idea of a large
extra dimension may be possible to test indirectly. Since gravitons
are not so tightly confined as the other particles, sometimes they
will stray into the surrounding hyperspace, becoming heavier than
the ordinary variety.
</P>
<P>
   According to the theorists' calculations, it just may be
possible to create momentarily these denizens of the fourth
dimension using the Tevatron accelerator at Fermilab, where protons
are slammed into antiprotons to produce energies measured in
trillions of electron-volts.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists would not be able to detect heavy gravitons directly
_ they would immediately fly off into the higher dimension _ but
their existence might be inferred. Energy going into a particle
collision must equal the energy coming out. If some is missing and
all other possibilities are accounted for, physicists could surmise
that the energy was spirited away by the heavy gravitons, carried
off into hyperspace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it might be possible to concentrate so many heavy
gravitons into a tiny volume of space that they would collapse in
on themselves and create miniature black holes, those cosmic
sinkholes from which nothing can escape. Experiments like this will
be on the agenda when the Large Hadron Collider begins operation in
five or six years at the CERN accelerator center in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   ``These black holes should be quite safe,'' Giddings said, for
they would rapidly evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual fun may be only beginning. Combining the
Randall and Sundrum theory with a conjecture made a couple of years
ago by a young Argentinian physicist, Dr. Juan Maldacena, yields
the latest big idea: the physics governing the particles stuck to
this brane might be a kind of shadow of a more fundamental physics
prevailing in the surrounding megaverse.
</P>
<P>
   In laser holography, a three-dimensional image is encoded onto a
two-dimensional surface. Viewed at the proper angle, the third
dimension seems magically to pop out. So think of each separate
brane world as a hologram carrying a flattened version of the Truly
Universal Laws. Each would capture the view from a slightly
different perspective, resulting in different universes ruled by
different laws of physics.
</P>
<P>
   What denizens of this universe call the Standard Model would not
be standard at all, but more like a book of local traffic laws.
Viewed from the fourth dimension, however, universality would
prevail. If they were clever enough, scientists on each brane world
could deduce the same overarching law of gravity, the lingua franca
of the megaverse.
</P>
<P>
   As they await the data that will provide a reality check, the
physicists on this brane are enjoying their new intellectual toy.
``We can look at any question we were previously mystified by and
get a new handle on it,'' Lykken said. ``That doesn't mean this is
right, but it makes theorists very happy.'' &QL;

IGNATIUS NAMED EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Ignatius, a columnist and editor at The Washington Post,
was named Monday as the executive editor of The International
Herald Tribune. He will succeed Michael Getler in September, when
Getler's term expires, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Editing a global newspaper in the age of globalization is the
ultimate challenge,'' said Ignatius, 49, who has worked at the Post
since 1986, overseeing business coverage as well as serving as
foreign editor and editor of the Sunday opinion section.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing The International Herald Tribune ``is a
combination of preserving the editorial excellence and changing
enough so we're changing with the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, which is based in Paris, is owned jointly by The
New York Times and The Washington Post and is printed in 19 cities.
</P>
<P>
   While the newspaper, which was founded in 1887, has long served
as a mainstay for Americans staying or living abroad, it faces keen
competition from The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   The International Herald Tribune, which uses stories from its
two owners as well as staff reports, has the advantage of having a
wider focus than its competitors, which are primarily business
publications, Ignatius said. ``We're in a position to see the world
whole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ignatius said he planned to work closely with Peter C. Goldmark
Jr., the newspaper's chairman and chief executive, to examine
Internet projects and other business ventures the company might be
able to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   At The Washington Post, Ignatius is an associate editor and
op-ed columnist, writing mostly about business and technology twice
a week. He said he hoped to continue to write a column in his new
position.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming a columnist last year, Ignatius served as the
Post's assistant managing editor in charge of business news for six
years. He was the foreign editor from 1990-92, and edited the
Outlook section, covering politics, economics, foreign policy and
intellectual trends from 1986-90.
</P>
<P>
   Ignatius also spent 10 years as a reporter for The Wall Street
Journal.

JUSTICES TO DECIDE LAWYER WELFARE LIMITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide if the
U.S. government can bar federally funded lawyers for poor people
from lobbying against strict welfare laws without violating the
attorneys' constitutional right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to consider the constitutionality of a federal
law that bars Legal Services Corp. attorneys, who use federal money
to represent poor people, from urging Congress and state
legislators to relax restrictions on welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   These attorneys say the law violates their First Amendment right
to speak freely on a major issue _ welfare reform _ and interferes
with their ability to vigorously represent their poor clients, who
are often the victims of welfare restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration counters that the law is valid
because the government can legally restrict the political
activities of people who receive federal money. Under the statute,
the lawyers can still lobby lawmakers, just not while receiving
federal money, the administration adds.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to hear arguments in the case this
fall or winter and render their decision by July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Legal Services Corp. receives federal money each year, which
the independent body then doles out to attorneys, organizations and
governmental agencies that provide legal assistance to poor people.
This year the agency will receive about $304 million in federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1996, as part of a Republican-led effort to restrict
the eligibility of welfare recipients, passed legislation
prohibiting lawyers receiving the federal funds from lobbying in
``an effort to reform a federal or state welfare system.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Bilton, who administers the distribution of corporation
funds in the greater Houston area, said he hopes the Supreme Court
strikes down the lobbying restriction. He said his group's team of
federally funded attorneys stopped pressing Texas lawmakers to
relax the state's welfare laws following enactment of the federal
statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``As practitioners of law for the poor and underprivileged, we
don't like to see these restrictions,'' said Bilton, who directs
the Houston-based Gulf Coast Legal Foundation. ``We would like to
see the Supreme Court rule in favor of more and not less access''
to lawmakers, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, which covers 17 counties, will administer $4.8
million in Legal Service Corp. money this year to help a potential
client base of about 600,000 indigent people, Bilton said. In a
typical year, the group's 40 lawyers will handle cases on behalf of
about 8,000 people who avail themselves of the foundation's
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The case before the justices arose in 1997, when New York
lawyers who received corporation funds challenged the legal
restriction in federal court as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court for Eastern New York sided with the
government, saying that the lawyers can lobby all they want on
their own time with their own money.
</P>
<P>
   But, on appeal, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that
the law's prohibition on lobbying violated the lawyers' First
Amendment right to ``criticize government or advocate changes in
governmental policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration then appealed to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, the justices declined to consider the
constitutionality of a state law that makes it easier for neighbors
and school administrators to discover whether a convicted sexual
offender is within their midst.
</P>
<P>
   The court refused without comment to hear the appeal of a
Tennessee man who challenged the state's requirement that he
register with state law enforcement whenever he moves because of
his prior conviction for sexual battery.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Cutshall, who pleaded guilty in 1990 to aggravated sexual
battery of a 5-year-old relative, argued that Tennessee's
registration requirement amounted to an unconstitutional second
punishment for the same crime. He was released from prison in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, local communities are required to be told by
newspaper notice when a pedophile is released. The local school
superintendent is also required to be notified.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, information from the Texas sex offender registry is
available by written request.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's refusal to hear the Tennessee case sets no
binding legal precedent regarding the constitutionality of
so-called ``Megan's laws,'' named for 7-year-old Megan Kanka, a New
Jersey girl who was raped and killed in 1994 by a twice-convicted
child molester who lived in her neighborhood. All 50 states have
some sort of law encouraging public notification of the whereabouts
of convicted sex offenders.

$250 MILLION CAMPAIGN PLANNED TO PROMOTE SAFETY OF BIOTECH FOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Responding to a backlash against genetically
engineered crops, some of the world's biggest biotechnology
companies said Monday they will spend up to $250 million over the
next five years to convince consumers that the products are safe.
</P>
<P>
   The North American campaign, which began Monday with television
commercials on the major broadcast networks and cable, comes after
months of criticism, controversy and lawsuits over the widespread
introduction of genetically engineered crops into agriculture,
particularly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With billions of dollars at stake, and a huge portion of
American farmers' crops devoted to genetically modified corn and
soybeans, the major biotechnology companies say they feel compelled
to counter what they say is a rising wave of antibiotech hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a need to turn up the volume with accurate information
in the face of misinformation,'' said Carl Feldbaum, president of
the Biotechnology Industry Association, which is also a founding
member of the new group.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, led by Monsanto, a division of the Pharmacia
Corp., say they have joined forces to create the Council for
Biotechnology Information, a Washington-based group that is
coordinating the effort to win public approval.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeremy Rifkin, a longtime opponent of biotechnology, said he
believes the campaign will backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to open a Pandora's box for them,'' Rifkin said.
``When people watch these ads they're going to say, `What? What are
genetic foods? Why are they in our stores?' In Europe, when people
heard about genetically modified foods they became more
skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Rifkin retained some of the nation's most
prominent antitrust lawyers to file a lawsuit against Monsanto for
engaging in anti-competitive practices and rushing genetically
altered seeds to market without properly testing them.
</P>
<P>
   Though a recent government survey suggests that American farmers
have begun cutting back on biotech plantings _ something the big
companies strongly dispute _ the industry says that over 60 million
acres of corn and soybean were planted with genetically altered
seeds a year ago, and farmers generally approve of the products
because they cut down on chemical spraying.
</P>
<P>
   But with opposition growing in Europe and Asia, and Americans
also growing wary, the companies say they are at a critical
juncture in the process and want to assure consumers that the
products have been thoroughly tested and offer great benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, they say, science will create more nutritious
foods: tomatoes that stay ripe, fruits that can deliver vaccines,
and the prospect of growing more food on less land, enough to feed
a global population that could top 9 billion in the year 2050, the
council says.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a Web site nor a pamphlet created by the council,
however, tell consumers what foods already contain genetically
modified substances. The answer, experts say, is everything from
McDonald's french fries to breakfast cereal and corn chips.
</P>
<P>
   The council says it hopes to give consumers information about
how agricultural biotechnology works, and what it is, and to tell
consumers that the products have been ``exhaustively reviewed'' by
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ads were designed to raise awareness about
biotechnology,'' said Jeff Bergau, a spokesman at Monsanto. ``What
we've found is that people just aren't thinking about this. The
overwhelming response is people need more information. When people
are exposed to a number of sources, people are overwhelmingly
likely to embrace it.''
</P>
<P>
   The council has hired BSMG Worldwide, a public relations,
marketing and advertising agency, that has expertise in crisis
management and consumer awareness campaigns. BSMG is a unit of True
North Communications, which is based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The council began airing a 30-second television spot Monday on
some of the major networks, including CNN and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The council said its advisory board includes scientists like Ray
Allan Goldberg, an emeritus professor of agriculture and business
at Harvard University as well as Mickey Kantor, the former commerce
secretary, and Dr. Louis Sullivan, the former Secretary of Health
and Human Services under President Bush.

   TERM-LIMITS (Hollywood, Fla.) _ For nearly two decades, Elaine
Bloom has been a fixture in the Florida House of Representatives.
Now, at 62, she is running an uphill campaign for Congress against
a popular 10-term Republican representative, E. Clay Shaw Jr., in
what promises to be one of the most expensive House races in the
country this year. Why would she relinquish a position of stature
she loves for a long shot at a seat on a back bench in Washington?
Two words: term limits. Like 17 other states, Florida placed a
limit in the early 1990s on the number of years that legislators
could serve. This year, in dozens of places from coast to coast,
politicians like Ms. Bloom are campaigning for higher office
against prominent incumbents. It is a consequence that few of the
advocates foresaw when the term-limit measures were enacted. And it
has created many more compelling races for Congress. By David E.
Rosenbaum. (Scheduled to move by 8 p.m. ET in ``p'' news file.)

that are drawing national attention. While experimentation is going
on in a few states in other regions, almost every southern
governor, Republican or Democrat, is either hunting for new school
money or trying novel combinations of familiar and occasionally
untested ideas for improving student achievement. Some of the plans
mix new spending for large state education agencies and teacher
salaries with conservative proposals like vouchers and an end to
teacher job protection. By David Firestone. (Scheduled to move by 9

STORMS DON'T DETER PILOTS, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commercial pilots are far more likely to fly into severe
thunderstorms than aviation officials previously thought _ and the
closer the jet is to the airport, the less likely the pilot is to
change course, an MIT study has found.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms are breeding grounds for wind shear, a sudden and
dangerous burst of wind. Wind shear has been blamed for many
aviation accidents, including the crash-landings of US Air Flight
1016 in Charlotte, N.C., in 1994, killing 37 people, and Delta Air
Lines Flight 191 at Dallas-Fort Worth on Aug. 2, 1985, killing 137.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised to find that pilots were penetrating Level
3, Level 4, and Level 5 storms,'' coauthor Dale A. Rhoda said
Monday. In a Level 3 storm, rainfall is between 1.1 inches and 2.2
inches per hour; in a Level 5 storm, between 4.5 and 7.1 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda authored the report, done at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory,
with Margot Pawlak. It examined weather in the Dallas-Fort Worth
and Love Field approach areas and found that in 60 hours of stormy
weather in spring and summer 1997, there were 2,000 approaches to
the airports. In two-thirds of them, the pilots chose to fly
through the severe weather. And the closer to the airport the
planes flew, the less likley the pilots were to alter course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data show very little variation in pilots' behavior near
the destination airport; nearly all of the encounters within 20-30
kilometers of the airport resulted in penetrations,'' the report
states.
</P>
<P>
   But the closer a plane is to an airport, the lower its altitude
is _ and the more vulnerable it is to wind shear.
</P>
<P>
   In each case studied, though, the plane landed safely without
injuries or other incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the study found, pilots are a bit like sheep:
If one plane flies through a thunderstorm instead of around it, the
plane behind it is likely to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Rhoda said, is that pilots on approach and air
traffic controllers are all on the same radio frequency. ``The
report from the preceding pilot, who has the same concerns and
sensitivities as you, is an additional piece of valuable
information,'' Rhoda said. ``It is very current, one of the most
current pieces of information they have. The only trouble is that
weather can change in the two or three minutes between consecutive
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both the Delta and US Air flights that crashed were
following planes that had taken off or landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that pilots were less likley to change
course at night or if they had spent more time flying to the
destination than had been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Air Line Pilots Association were
unavailable for comment Monday.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ For nearly two decades, Elaine Bloom has been
a fixture in the Florida House of Representatives, an outspoken
Democrat who has served at various times as deputy majority leader,
speaker pro tem, and chairwoman of the health and tourism
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 62, she is running an uphill campaign for Congress
against a popular 10-term Republican incumbent, E. Clay Shaw Jr.,
in what promises to be one of the most expensive House races in the
country this year. Why would she relinquish a position of stature
she loves in Tallahassee for a long shot at a seat on a back bench
in Washington, a thousand miles from her home and family?
</P>
<P>
   Two words: term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Like 17 other states, Florida placed a limit in the early 1990s
on the number of years that legislators and many other state
officials could serve.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in dozens of places from coast to coast, politicians
like Bloom who are prohibited from running for re-election are
campaigning instead for higher office against prominent incumbents.
It is a consequence that few of the advocates foresaw when the
term-limit measures were enacted. And it has created many more
compelling races for Congress than might otherwise have been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for instance, a state senator knocked off an
incumbent congressman in the Democratic primary last month, and
several other state legislators are competing in congressional
races. In Ohio, two of the leading members of the Legislature
competed against each other in the Republican primary for a
congressional seat in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom typifies the situation. ``I have been an insider,'' she
said as she drove from a lunch at a synagogue in North Miami Beach
to the police station here in Hollywood, just north of Fort
Lauderdale, where she spoke to the officers. ``I love the
Legislature. If it were not for term limits, I probably would
continue where I am. It would be the easiest thing to do. But
that's not possible now.''
</P>
<P>
   In some states, like California and Colorado, the first impact
of term-limit laws was felt in 1998. In others like Florida and
Ohio, eight-year limits were enacted in 1992, and the first effect
is being felt this year.
</P>
<P>
   In California this month, state Sen. Hilda L. Solis soundly
defeated Rep. Matthew G. Martinez, who was running for his 10th
term, in the Democratic primary for a safe Democratic seat in an
eastern suburb of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that what motivated her was term limits,''
said Allan E. Hoffenblum, publisher of the nonpartisan California
Target Book, which handicaps political races in the state. ``She
was looking for a long-term career.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, there are only 40 state senators and 80 seats in
the Assembly, compared with 52 congressional seats from California
out of a total of 435 in the House of Representatives. That means
state senators represent more people and generally have
considerably more influence than all but the most senior members of
Congress. And in the Assembly, positions of authority are reached
much more quickly than they are in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in his right gourd would leave Sacramento and run for
Congress if not for term limits,'' Hoffenblum said. ``It's 3,000
miles away, and it's awfully hard for a member of Congress to have
any visibility in California.''
</P>
<P>
   But with term limits in place, another Democratic state senator,
Adam Schiff, is challenging Rep. James E. Rogan, a Republican, in
the district that includes Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, a term-limited Democratic assemblywoman, Susan
Davis, is running against Rep. Brian P. Bilbray, and in a district
west of San Jose, a term-limited Republican assemblyman, Jim
Cunneen, is running for an open seat in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, there are no term limits on the state level, but
New York City officials can serve no more than eight years. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who cannot run for a third term, is running for
the U.S. Senate. Also, several City Council members are running for
higher office.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, two legislators about to lose their seats to the
eight-year limit _ Pat Tiberi, majority leader of the Ohio House,
and state Sen. Eugene Watts _ competed this month in a rousing
Republican primary to replace Rep. John R. Kasich, who is retiring
from Congress. Tiberi (pronounced TEE-berry) won.
</P>
<P>
   Kasich himself is something of a victim of term limits. The
Supreme Court ruled in 1995 that states could not apply limits to
the terms of members of Congress. But the Republican Party in the
House decreed that its members could sit no more than six years as
committee chairmen. Kasich's term as chairman of the Budget
Committee is up after this year, clearly a reason he is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, another state where term limits are having an effect
for the first time this year, three friends and colleagues who are
unable to run for re-election _ Attorney General Joseph R. Mazurek,
Auditor Mark O'Keefe and Secretary of State Mike Cooney _ are
campaigning against one another for the Democratic nomination for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic governors who cannot run for re-election are
challenging Republican senators, setting up a couple of tight
Senate races.In Delaware, Gov. Thomas R. Carper is running against
Sen. William V. Roth Jr., and in Missouri, Gov. Mel Carnahan is
challenging Sen. John Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There may be more good races for Congress here in Florida as a
result of term limits than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bloom, state Sen. Patsy Kurth, a Democrat, is
running against a three-term Republican representative, Dave
Weldon, in an East Coast district that includes Melbourne and Vero
Beach. In Orlando, Linda Chapin, a Democrat who has completed the
eight years she is allowed to serve as chairwoman of the Orange
County Commission, a powerful position equivalent to mayor of a
large city, is running for the open seat now held by Rep. Bill
McCollum, a Republican who is running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are favored to hold all three of these seats. But
politicians in both parties give each of the Democratic women a
strong chance to pull an upset.
</P>
<P>
   None more so than Elaine Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that is because the voters in the 22nd congressional
district _a sliver 90 miles long and rarely more than a couple
miles wide along the Atlantic Ocean from Miami Beach to north of
West Palm Beach _ vote solidly Democratic except for their support
for Shaw, who has rarely had a consequential opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton carried the district handily in 1992 and 1996. In
1998, Buddy MacKay, the Democratic candidate for governor, won 54
percent of the vote in the district when he lost statewide to Jeb
Bush, 55 percent to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important is Bloom's ability to raise a prodigious sum
of money in one of the most expensive districts in the country to
run in.
</P>
<P>
   So far, records show, she has raised $1 million, and she says
she intends to raise another $1 million before Election Day. These
sums may be necessary because just to run a television advertising
campaign the last three weeks before the November election will
cost more than $850,000, Bloom's campaign manager, Jeffrey Garcia,
said.
</P>
<P>
   She raised more than $250,000 for her campaign chest at a
fund-raiser last month that Clinton attended. It has been his only
appearance so far to raise money for a Democratic challenger for
Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   The president was repaying a political debt. In 1991, Bloom was
one of the first elected officials in the country to endorse his
presidential candidacy. At the fund-raiser here, the president
said, ``Elaine was there for me when only my mother thought I could
be elected.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw, moderate in temperament and skilled as a lawmaker, is
a formidable opponent. He has held the seat easily for 20 years.
There is a possibility that if he wins re-election, he will become
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. And he will doubtless
match Bloom dollar for dollar.
</P>
<P>
   He was chief sponsor in 1996 of the law that ended the old
welfare system. And he is a main sponsor this year of the measure
to allow Social Security recipients 65 and older to earn as much
money as they want without losing benefits. That legislation is
especially popular here, where one-third of the residents are over
65, the highest proportion of any district in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good,'' Shaw, 60, said in an interview. ``Our
polls are strong, and we are definitely ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, shortly after Republicans won control of the
House, Shaw voted in favor of a constitutional amendment imposing
term limits on members of Congress _ a proposal that fell well
short of the two-thirds majority needed for approval. Now, he said,
after watching what has happened in Tallahassee, he has changed his
mind on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the next Florida Legislature is going to miss a lot of
experienced legislators,'' he said. ``A lot of us may look back and
think it's not a very good idea.''

FREEDOM SECURITIES SEEKS $25-A-SHARE OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Freedom Securities Corp. would sell itself if a buyer
came forward with $25 a share, people close to the brokerage and
investment firm say.
</P>
<P>
   Three years since Freedom's management-led buyout from John
Hancock Financial Services, insiders are tired of waiting for their
big payoff, former employees say. Freedom's shares, even after
surging nearly 40 percent since Jan. 1, are at $15.625 _ 22 percent
below their IPO price of two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston Financial Corp. is said to have offered as much as
$19 a share for Freedom, sources say, but those talks appear not to
have moved far.
</P>
<P>
   For Fleet, such a purchase would mean adding high-end brokers to
its current Quick &AMP; Reilly discount brokerage arm and its
Suretrade.com online trading site. Brokers could help sell Fleet's
mutual funds. It's less clear how Tucker Cleary's (formerly Tucker
Anthony Inc.) investment banking and research capabilities would
fit with the larger Robertson Stephens, which Fleet gained in its
BankBoston buyout.
</P>
<P>
   John Goldsmith, Freedom's chief executive, said no FleetBoston
offer was presented to him. As for whether the brokerage and
investment firm, which owns Tucker, of Boston, would sell for a $10
premium over its current share price, Goldsmith said, ``It's like
asking what would you do if someone put a gun to your head. You
don't know until it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence of stress at the company. In the Freedom
Capital division, which manages money for pension funds and for
individuals, a $100 million fund-of-funds has been quietly shut
down. The company had tried to sell the funds, which are run by
several portfolio managers, but when the sale fell apart, it simply
decided to fold the operation, people close to the situation said.
</P>
<P>
   At least six employees have left Freedom as a result of the fund
closure, and the assets are to be returned to the investors.
Brokers who sold the fund say they have been left in the lurch.
Goldsmith deferred questions about the fund to the unit's chief,
Dexter Dodge, who could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   There have been talks about changing Freedom's name to Tucker
Cleary, after its best-known unit and biggest revenue producer.
Freedom's stock is not widely followed on Wall Street, and a string
of small acquisitions has not raised its profile.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom's revenue rose 26 percent last year, to $553.3 million.
Net income rose 16 percent to $29.1 million, or $1.39 per share.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Freedom's stock has lagged in part due to unlucky
timing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a growing business, investors have shunned most
financial stocks for the past year, as high-tech stocks grabbed the
spotlight. And Freedom missed the window of opportunity in 1997 and
1998 when banks were scooping up regional brokers for big prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hottest candidates have been acquired,'' observed Dennis
Gallant, a consultant with Cerulli Associates, a Boston firm that
researches financial firms. And the rise of online brokerage hasn't
helped regional firms like Freedom, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith countered that Freedom has online trading
capabilities, but its wealthy clientele prefer to deal with
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's ever going to be a big part of our
business,'' Goldsmith said. ``We are very focused on the high- end,
touchy-feely, end of the business, people who want to talk to
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goldsmith and his high-profile backers at the Boston buyout
firm of Thomas H. Lee Co. didn't get into the brokerage business to
see their stakes grow so modestly. There is a clear willingness to
sell the company if an attractive offer comes along, according to
people close to the upper ranks at Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Top brass and Lee are not underwater: Their shares were valued
at about $5.50 each before the April 1998 IPO, sources said. But
employees and outsiders who invested when the shares went public
have reaped no profits yet.
</P>
<P>
   Lee owns 22.5 percent of Freedom's shares. Other top holders
include Wellington Management of Boston, with a 4.2 percent stake,
and Dimensional Fund Advisors of Santa Monica, Calif., with a 3.3
percent stake.

   &QL;  MASS. COMPANIES RALLY FOR CHINA TRADE BILL
</P>
<P>
   By Alex Canizares
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 3 - Arguing that China's one billion-member
market represents an untapped gold mine for New England high-tech
companies, Massachusetts businesses are joining a push to open
permanent free trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that if a trade agreement is passed and China joins
the (World Trade Organization), Chinese purchases of Massachusetts
high-tech equipment will skyrocket,'' said Jim Klocke, director of
government affairs for the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber of commerce is one of three hundred other industry
leaders gathering in Washington today to rally support for
legislation that would allow U.S. companies to tap China's massive
market and, supporters say, help improve the country's business and
labor standards after China's expected entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. businesses claim if Congress fails to pass the legislation,
China's entry to the WTO -- expected to be approved by the
international organization as early as this summer -- would open
the market to countries besides the United States.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made the trade agreement a top priority
and is aggressively lobbying members of Congress to vote on the
bill by Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Democratic Leadership Council in San Jose,
Calif., yesterday, Clinton unveiled a letter endorsed by CEOs of
nearly 200 high-tech companies supporting the legislation, pending
for a vote in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also includes signatures from 40 governors, including
Gov. Paul Cellucci, who returned yesterday from a two-week trade
mission to China.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Massachusetts exported $366 million in goods to
China, up 15.4 percent from 1998, according to the governor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's chamber of commerce maintains that if China joins the
WTO and the U.S. passes permanent trade relations, high-tech
companies and financial institutions would be the most immediate
beneficiaries, Klocke said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' exports to mainland China of scientific
instruments, electronic hardware and other high-tech goods - which
totaled $114 million in 1997 -- could grow by a factor of eight in
coming years, Klocke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally it's a concern that if we don't do it, we stand to
lose,'' said Savage Deirdre W. Savage, vice president and general
counsel of the New England Council, which represents businesses,
academic, health and financial institutions in the region and is
attending today's event. ``We believe that by having American
companies in place (in China) it can only lead to liberalization of
the whole society.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies also maintain that China's entry to the WTO would
force the country to drop non-tariff trade barriers that deter
foreign companies from entering the market.
</P>
<P>
   China currently places strict restrictions on sales of
telecommunications services. Another rule bars foreign banks from
opening branches outside of a handful of major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Haemonetics Corp., a manufacturer of automated blood processing
equipment in Braintree that is attending the rally, hopes China's
WTO membership and U.S. businesses' presence in China's market
would nudge the country to comply with business practices and
international laws, such as rules to protect intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   This would make business planning more reliable for Haemonetics,
which conducts one-third of its sales overseas, and projects its
sales to China will grow to $30 million, said Lisa Lopez, the
firm's vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Lopez said, the lack of transparency in China
makes its trade and licensing restrictions seem like ``state
secrets'' to U.S. and other foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton's bill faces an uphill battle in Congress,
especially among Democrats, who are under strong pressure from
labor unions to vote it down on the grounds that it limits the
United States from being able to influence China's human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts lawmakers are either opposed to, or undecided on,
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is giving China free reign with no checks or
balances,'' said Massachusetts AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Kathleen
Casavant. ``If we do grant them permanent trade status, it's
basically letting them do what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an annual review, Congress has granted China normal trade
status every year since 1980, and conducts over $14 billion in
trade each year. Such a review would be made unnecessary under the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts AFL-CIO is waging its own lobbying campaign in
Washington, and will send between 400 to 500 labor leaders from the
state to join what they hope will be 10,000 unionists from around
country on April 12 to fight against the China bill and
international trade organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really up in arms on this,'' Casavant said.
</P>

MICROSOFT CASE SHIFTS TO REMEDY PHASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the decision is in, the Microsoft trial shifts to a new
phase during which the penalty, or remedy, will be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told the litigants that he
wants to hold a separate hearing as part of his deliberations over
a remedy. He has not said how it will be structured or when it will
begin. But Microsoft and the government will at least be asked to
file written proposals describing their proposed remedies. The 19
state attorneys general and the Justice Department together are to
file just one proposal.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the judge may want to hear testimony from witnesses
offered by both sides, though he has not said if that is his plan.
But in anticipation that he might, over the last few months the
Justice Department, the states and Microsoft all have been trying
to recruit potential witnesses for the remedy hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, sometime this summer, the judge will issue his remedy
and close the case. Only then can Microsoft file its appeal.

NASDAQ LOSES 350 POINTS IN MICROSOFT AFTERMATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite index plummeted nearly 350 points Monday,
the biggest point decline in its 29-year history, as Microsoft
Corp.'s failed settlement talks in the federal antitrust case
accelerated a sell-off that began last week and has clobbered most
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors fleeing tech stocks did not leave the stock market
entirely. Instead, they sent a deluge of money into retail,
financial, and other stocks that comprise the Dow Jones industrial
average, which climbed 300.01 points. The Dow's sharp rise
continued to lift an index that has gained 15 percent from its
recent low just over a month ago. The Dow index closed at
11,221.93.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's descent started as the market opened, in reaction
to news over the weekend that the federal government and Microsoft
had reached an impasse. Anticipation of a harsh court ruling
against the world's biggest software company in the government's
antitrust case sent its stock down $15.375 a share, to $90.875.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq losses amounted to a 7.63 percent decline, the
index's fifth worst ever, in percentage terms _ and its toughest
day since Russia's financial crisis sent tremors through the world
markets in the roiling summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's decline compounded a correction last week. The
index _ which leaped through the 5000 ceiling earlier this year _
came to rest at 4223.77.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got killed,'' Mark Minervini, chief investment strategist
for Quantech Research Group in Connecticut. ``The Nasdaq right now
is a dangerous place to be, and I'd be very cautious in that area
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's 349.06-point drop exceeded the second-worst day on
record _ Jan. 4 _ by 120 points. The precipitous drop concentrated
its biggest losses to small technology companies more vulnerable to
a Nasdaq decline. By contrast, many computer giants withstood the
index's drop _ Hewlett-Package Co. and Hopkinton-based EMC Corp.
were unchanged _ and IBM Corp. actually rose $3.625 a share, to
$122.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has the power to pull down the Nasdaq, because it is
one of the biggest issues in an index that gives more weight to
member companies with the largest market capitalization. Cisco
Systems Inc. recently passed Microsoft as the company with the
largest market value on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, though a Nasdaq-listed company, is also one of the
companies that make up the Dow average of 30 industrials. But, a
runup in a host of old-line companies enabled the Dow to counteract
the downdraft from technology. American Express rose $6.5625 a
share, to $155.50. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. gained $4.6875, closing at
$61.1875 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's decline, said Marshall Acuff of Salomon Smith
Barney, was a catalyst for closing the gap between the overpriced
Nasdaq and the slower-moving Dow. The Dow so far this year is down
2.4 percent; the Nasdaq is up 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you got today are growth investors who said we'd better
put money in health care, consumer staples, and financials,'' Acuff
said. He predicted Microsoft investors may continue to sell their
shares.
</P>
<P>
   But, Microsoft, which sells the Windows operating system seen on
most company and home desktop computers, ultimately may recover
from yet another punch in its lengthy legal match with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Irrevocable damage has already been done to hundreds of smaller
companies that may be forced to scrap plans to raise capital in the
stock market to finance their growth, investment experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology IPO window, which was wide enough to drive two
semitrucks through a week ago, is now closed _ and closed until
further notice,'' said James Weiss, head of equities for State
Street Research &AMP; Management Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Investors stampeded out of small companies, many of which have
been fair game for speculative buying that has sent stocks to
dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of high-flying Akamai Technologies Inc. lost more than
a third of its value, falling $41.81 a share, to $119. Sycamore
Networks Inc. slid $27.9375 a share, to $101.0625, and Navisite
Inc. lost $26 a share, closing at $95.75.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation over the fallout of Microsoft's antitrust battle
with the government has added to the Nasdaq's volatility, which has
experienced wider and wider swings in recent months and is
especially troubling for small tech companies. Portfolio managers
said the index is expected to be choppy for days, even weeks, and
it may fall further Tuesday as details of the ruling are pored over
by analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The wording of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's finding was
harsh, saying that Microsoft unlawfully ``maintained its monopoly
power by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the Web
browser market'' in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment experts argued the decision had very little
impact on the Nasdaq, which was destined to continue a decline from
highs that a growing contingent on Wall Street believes is
unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nasdaq would've gone down without the Microsoft'' events, said
Lawrence Horwitz, an economist with Primark Decision Economics in
Boston. ``There's still a shift going on toward so-called value
stocks that are not nearly as expensive and where there are actual
earnings,'' Horwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft only added to the bad environment, he said. ``People
are quite worried whatever decision comes down today, and in future
months, that Microsoft's value will be eroded.''

FOLLOW THESE SIMPLE STEPS TO FIX OSCARS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Maybe I shouldn't complain about the length and the
ponderous pacing of the Oscars telecast. After all, I got paid to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from some readers' comments _ ``awful,''
``absolutely the worst,'' ``a rerun of ``The X-Files'' was far
better viewing'' _ maybe I should. (And these people watched for
free.)
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, I have a few suggestions for next year's show,
humbly submitted.
</P>
<P>
   First, rehire Billy Crystal. His musical tribute to the Best
Picture nominees always goes on too long and his hero worship of
Jack Nicholson is a pain, but when they drop him into films, it's
always entertaining, and his jokes usually hit the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Next, eliminate more minor awards from the telecast.
Sound-effects editing is crucial to a picture, but frankly, who
cares who does it best?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, try this: Lose the filler, complete the show in two
hours and immediately broadcast the Best Picture winner.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would watch, and even with a long movie, we'd still be
done in time for the news.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what do I know? Oscar ratings were up over last
year, and it was the most-watched show of the week. A lot of
gluttons for punishment out there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If this is the end for ``Sports Night,'' it's going out in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistency has been a theme this season, whether in the
quality of the writing (creator Aaron Sorkin's attention has been
divided by his other excellent show, ``The West Win''g) or simply
its hide-and-seek spot on the schedule (ABC routinely yanked it
during sweeps ratings periods).
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night's show was a return to ``Sports Night'''s
goulash-of-a-plot form, a brilliant episode dealing with budget
cuts, possible layoffs, romantic headaches and _ improbably but
absolutely winningly _ Passover. Hints at the show's presumably
impending demise popped up everywhere, yet were so perfectly
inserted that the effect was more heartbreaking than obvious.
</P>
<P>
   It comes down to this: ``Action'' is dead. ``Freaks and Geeks''
sleeps with the Nielsen fishes. Can't ABC leave viewers with one
show that prizes quality over quantity and makes a viewer feel cool
for liking it to boot? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Discovery has commissioned a sequel to its ``Raising the
Mammoth,'' the highest-rated cable documentary ever.
</P>
<P>
   What is it going to do? Bury it again? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, shut my mouth. After complaining that ``WWF Smackdown!''
is all UPN cares about, word arrives of a pilot called ``I Spike,''
a show about female FBI agents who go undercover as, ahem,
volleyball players. Another show in the works is called ``Hip-Hop
Bounty Hunters,'' about ... well, guess.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Let's add one more Oscar-show suggestion: Let UPN broadcast
it.

COMMENTARY: HURRICANE HUGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ One of the newest government office
buildings in Caracas is the marbled-sided Ministry of Finance.
Walking through the lobby there the other day I noticed that the
huge clock overlooking the reception desk was either (a) broken or
(b) 20 minutes slow. I didn't stay long enough to see which. But I
did stay in Venezuela long enough to realize that many people were
asking the same thing about President Hugo Chavez's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Is it broken? Or is it just a little late in blooming? Is he
leading Venezuela in a transition, the exact direction of which
will emerge after the May 28 presidential elections, or is he
leading Venezuela into a dead end?
</P>
<P>
   Who is Hugo Chavez? You hear that a lot here, and not just from
the corrupt politicians who ruled Venezuela for four decades before
the populist Chavez ousted them in a vote last year that amounted
to an electoral revolution. With unemployment here at 20 percent,
and with the economy having shrunk by 7.2 percent last year, even
some of the poor have turned against Chavez with graffiti: ``He
feeds us rhetoric to fill our minds, but our stomachs are empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best description of Chavez was from a diplomat here
who said: ``Hugo Chavez is a work in progress _ and a piece of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hugo Chavez who is a piece of work is the Chavez who ordered
U.S. military ships steaming to Venezuela _ on an emergency aid
mission to rebuild the vital coastal highway destroyed by mudslides
_ to go away. Chavez, a former army colonel and pal of Fidel
Castro, didn't want to look too dependent on the U.S. He recently
described Castro's medical-welfare system as a ``sea of happiness''
_ ignoring how many Cubans were risking their lives to swim away
from that sea.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hugo Chavez who is a work in progress is equally
interesting. Venezuela's political system needed a radical
overhaul, and Chavez is doing that. But so far his biggest reform
has been to rewrite the Constitution to widen his powers and
lengthen his potential time in office.
</P>
<P>
   If Chavez is re-elected in May _ he is being challenged by
Francisco Arias Cardenas, a former comrade who has charged Chavez
with incompetence _ the big question is, what will he build on his
new foundation, and with whom? Frankly, his team has a certain
Keystone Kops, not-ready-for-prime-time quality to it.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is obvious. Venezuela is a country that has been
cursed with oil. The reigning assumption in this nation, which sits
atop some of the world's richest fields, has been that Venezuela is
naturally rich and if it is getting poorer it is because someone in
power is stealing. So politics has tended to be about whom to
lynch, not what to build. The truth is, though, that with 85
percent of its foreign currency coming from oil sales, Venezuela is
a country that has forgotten how to create wealth. It only knows
how to distribute it. First the oligarchs distributed it to their
cronies. Now Chavez wants to give more to the underclass.
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't enough oil money anymore, and Chavez has not
detailed any credible plan for creating new wealth _ by attracting
non-energy-related foreign investment and building globally
competitive companies _ so that one-fifth of the country doesn't
have to work for the government. Today, the biggest export of
Venezuela's private sector is itself; the managers and scientists
who have global skills are leaving, frightened by the rising crime
wave and the Chavez populism that suggests that anyone here who has
money must have stolen it.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Chavez ran for office as Robin Hood in a country that needs
Bill Gates _ someone who not only redistributes wealth but knows
how to create it. Chavez came into office with a deep suspicion of
globalization. But on his recent trip to Beijing it was the Chinese
who told him to pay more attention to developing a globally
competitive private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez deserves a chance to prove himself as something more than
Robin Hood. If he can use his credibility with Venezuela's
underclass to lead them to a more modern economy, he will become
one of the most important figures in Latin America. If he doesn't,
Venezuela, which is America's largest supplier of oil, is going to
witness some really explosive and destabilizing politics.
</P>
<P>
   Time is short, and, somewhere at least, a clock is ticking.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Privacy is our constitutional right, by golly, and
we are serious about it. The national refrain is: Leave us alone!
Despite her legend, Greta Garbo didn't invent this demand.
</P>
<P>
   But the noble business of keeping the government, commercial
enterprises, competitors and snoopy neighbors out of our personal
lives is not as simple as it sounds. We have buttressed the
Constitution with laws and court rulings. Yet still we find
ourselves enmeshed in profound and constantly expanding conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is great confusion about who gets to see what
records about whom in the Internet world of e-commerce, which is
still virtually unregulated. Congress is trying to grapple with the
issue but thus far not doing a reassuring job.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is afoot that our elected geniuses, or at least many
of those over 40, do not know what they are talking about on this
subject. They'd rather rag Vice President Al Gore, who does
understand the World Wide Web, about his claim to have invented the
Internet than master the subject themselves. That's what they hire
young staffers to do.
</P>
<P>
   Many individuals are refusing to fill out some of the questions
on the long form of the new Census Bureau survey because they feel
they are too intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the census is an important governing tool, the official
measurement of our national socioeconomic status that influences
how federal and state grants are allocated. Individual reports are
supposed to remain secret. The survey is after aggregate numbers
only.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., have encouraged reluctant participants not to answer all
the questions. Democrats charge they are less concerned about
privacy than about skewing the numbers to deny poorer regions the
government aid that they might otherwise be eligible for.
</P>
<P>
   Two other test cases over privacy issues have popped up
recently. Both New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and President
Clinton are accused of violating the privacy of individuals who
have embarrassed them. They released supposedly legally protected
records that make those individuals look bad.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, Clinton is on stronger legal ground than
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that the president
committed a crime by releasing letters to him from White House
volunteer worker Kathleen Willey, in which she seemed friendly and
affectionate despite her public charges that earlier Clinton had
offensively groped her. The judge regarded the letters as part of
the official White House record and therefore protected by the 1974
Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   But the letters represented a private correspondence between two
individuals. Willey sent her letters to the White House because
that is Clinton's mailing address. They are not official documents
that are normally subject to the Privacy Act. The Justice
Department and the president's lawyers, citing previous judicial
rulings, said such personal exchanges are in a separate category,
controlled by individual judgment, not by a law that is meant to
protect official, federally gathered information.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lamberth, however, has taken a provocative position that
is legally unsupportable. He had previously ruled that the Privacy
Act applied to every piece of paper or computer disc in the White
House, an extraordinary, single-handed attempt to undermine a
president's ability to function. In Lamberth's view, Clinton's lips
must be sealed against any attacks on him. Others may use knowledge
about him, but he may not counter with his knowledge about them
even though it was acquired from information other than
government-obtained documents. Sensibly, Clinton will appeal
Lamberth's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's political and legal bind is different. He released
official documents tracking the background of an unarmed black man
killed by police outside a local bar. To suggest the cops had
reason to fear Patrick Dorismond, Giuliani publicized details of
the victim's police and medical records, including juvenile charges
that had been dismissed and sealed by a court and a toxicology
report of marijuana in his body.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City charter requires that confidentiality laws be
obeyed _ by the mayor as well as everyone else. The mayor counters
that privacy laws end at death. But the Supreme Court recently
rejected a similar argument when Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
tried unsuccessfully to force White House aide Vincent Foster's
lawyer to tattle on the conversations they held shortly before
Foster committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani case, too, is going to court. The mayor complains
that ``politically correct prejudice'' is behind the angry backlash
he is enduring. Technically, as with Clinton, the issue is about
maybe breaking the law. Realistically, both cases involve
incumbents fending off others who are dumping on them. And nobody
is doing it in private.

&HT;     JUDGE RULES MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTI-TRUST LAWS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. violated the nation's anti-trust
laws by illegally using its dominant position in the computer
software industry to stifle competition and hurt consumers in an
attempt to ``monopolize'' the Internet browser market, a federal
judged ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft placed an oppressive thumb on the scales of market
fortune,'' U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said
in his 50-page ruling of law, delivering a resounding but not
unexpected defeat to the company that has been a cornerstone in the
heated technology economy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the software giant violated the anti-trust laws
laid out in the 1890 Sherman Act by maintaining its monopoly power
through ``anti-competitive means'' and ``attempting to monopolize''
the Web browser market. Internet browsers allow users access to the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jackson has handed down his verdict, the case moves
into the remedy phase. Among the possible remedies that Jackson
will consider are imposing fines on Microsoft, restricting its
conduct in the marketplace, and in the most extreme case, breaking
up the corporation. This decision could come later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said that Microsoft violated anti-trust rules by
``unlawfully tying its Web browser to its (Windows) operating
system.'' A computer's operating system is the core program that
allows other programs, such as word processing, to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft trammeled the competitive process through which the
software industry normally innovates and hurt consumers through its
actions,'' said Jackson, who added that the company could be sued
under state anti-competition laws.
</P>
<P>
   Because Windows runs 95 percent of all computers, Jackson said,
Microsoft's bundling, or tying together, of its operating system
and its Internet browser meant that browser competitors _ such as
the Netscape Communications Corp., now part of America Online _
were at a severe disadvantage when it comes to selling their own
products. This Microsoft practice led to less competition and less
innovation, which hurt consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference in Redmond, Wash., Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates promised to appeal Jackson's decision, arguing that his
company's browser is not a separate product but an integrated
feature of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we did everything we could to settle this case, we
believe we have a strong case on appeal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals could last two years.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gates said his company was still open to talks with the
Justice Department and the 19 states and District of Columbia that
brought the suit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At a Washington news conference, Joel I. Klein, who brought the
case for the government as chief of the Justice Department's
antitrust division, praised the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson's ruling will open the door to competition,
innovation and choice in the software industry,'' he said. ``It
will lay the ground rules for the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said: ``Microsoft has been held
accountable for its illegal conduct by a court of law. Thanks to
this ruling, consumers who have been harmed can now look forward to
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge accepted 23 of 26 arguments brought forth by the
states that joined the federal government in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling had been expected to go against Microsoft
based on harsh assessments he outlined in November in his findings
of fact. In that document, Jackson found that Microsoft repeatedly
engaged in anti-competitive behavior by taking advantage of its
monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson delayed issuing his ruling until after U.S.
stock markets had closed for the day, his anticipated harsh verdict
sent Microsoft stock down 15 3/8 to 90 7/8 on the Nasdaq exchange,
slicing $78 billion from the company's total capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft plunge triggered a record selloff in Nasdaq
stocks, sending the index down 349.15, or 7.6 percent, to close at
4,223.68. It was easily the Nasdaq's worst point drop in history,
surpassing a 229-point plunge on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling followed the collapse of settlement talks
between Microsoft and the Justice Department on Saturday. Chicago
appellate court Judge Richard Posner, whom Jackson appointed as a
mediator in November, said in a statement that the differences were
``too deep-seated'' to forge an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the failed talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that negotiations in Chicago collapsed after the
company insisted on its own proposal to settle the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became obvious that Microsoft was rejecting the
government's proposal and demanding their own approach,'' one
government source said. ``But their plan was filled with loopholes
and wouldn't have been effective or even workable.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a Saturday news conference, Gates blamed the failure of
the talks on the Department of Justice and the states, which he
said were not working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between them, they appeared to be demanding either a breakup
of our company or other extreme concessions,'' said Gates, who did
not provide details of the company's offer to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Monday's Wall Street Journal, Gates also said
that regardless of Jackson's ruling, his company would continue to
integrate the company's Internet browser into its Windows software,
even though that linkage is at the core of the Justice Department
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling is just a step in the legal process. It doesn't
change any situation relative to what we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal rejected Gates'
claim that the settlement talks failed because of a gulf between
the Justice Department and 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between the states and the Department of
Justice are minimal when compared to the divergence between our
side and Microsoft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson now will begin designing a remedy to the violations he
cited in his ruling. According to antitrust specialists familiar
with case, the judge likely will pick among one of three possible
settlements:
</P>
<P>
   _ Creating separate companies for operating systems,
applications software and the Internet. Gates would be allowed to
run only one of these companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, separate Bell telephone companies
were created to provide local service, while AT&AMP;T remained a
long-distance provider. The irony of this is that, if the AT&AMP;T
precedent prevails, the separate parts could eventually be worth
more than the whole, so Gates, a billionaire many times over, could
end up with even more wealth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keeping Microsoft intact but allow other companies to produce
their own versions of Windows, either by having Microsoft auction
off the rights to produce the software or by publishing Windows'
secret application program interfaces, or APIs, which run the
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring Microsoft to publish these interfaces and explain how
they work would help quell much of the criticism logged against the
company from its competitors. APIs are the software hooks that
enable other companies' programs, from word processors to games, to
run on Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some software developers contend that Microsoft has ``hidden
APIs'' in Windows that give a leg up to its own applications and
favored partners. Microsoft says that is untrue. Other software
developers alleged that the real problem is that the API
documentation from Microsoft is often misleading or erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leaving Microsoft and its monopoly status intact but imposing
specific rules on its behavior toward customers and competitors,
although this type of arrangement might require a huge Justice
Department enforcement effort.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the government ``will seek a remedy that prevents
Microsoft from using its monopoly in the future to stifle
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The states and the Justice Department will have to iron out any
differences in their approaches to a remedy. The states reportedly
are seeking to break up the company, while the Justice Department
is willing to accept less harsh terms.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of private litigation was seen as a major incentive
for Microsoft to settle. Several private antitrust lawsuits have
been filed against the company in anticipation of a guilty verdict.
With Jackson's finding that Microsoft violated the law, private
plaintiffs need only to prove that the software giant harmed them
through its actions.

SERB ARRESTED, CHARGED IN `ETHNIC CLEANSING' CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ In a daring pre-dawn raid, French
commandos blew down the door Monday of a Bosnian Serb linked to the
murder of thousands of Muslims and Croats, making him the highest
ranking official to be arrested on war crimes charges involving
``ethnic cleansing'' in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Momcilo Krajisnik, 55, a former leader of of the Bosnian Serbs,
was dragged from his bed to an armored personnel carrier and then
flown to a cell in The Hague to await arraignment on charges of
genocide and crimes against humanity later this week, said
prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia. They called the arrest in the Bosnian Serb stronghold
of Pale the most important of the 18 war crimes arrests made to
date by NATO forces in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a secret indictment, French soldiers used explosives
to breach the door to the home of Krajisnik's elderly father at 3
a.m., the prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The bold action may also have blown away insinuations that
French soldiers have been unduly sympathetic to the Serbs and
turned a blind eye to those indicted for war crimes in the sector
of Bosnia they control. It marked only the second time French
troops had arrested a suspected war criminal in Bosnia. British
troops have made the bulk of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was especially risky because Krajisnik was usually
surrounded by heavily armed bodyguards, but the French troops
pulled it off without any reported casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik stands accused of orchestrating the deaths of
thousands of Muslim and Croat men, women, and children and the
torture and forced deportation of hundreds of thousands more in
1991 and 1992. The indictment charged him with planning the
massacre of civilians in about 20 villages and towns, establishing
at least a dozen concentration camps, and conducting forced marches
to those camps in which victims were summarily pulled from the
ranks and shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik is a close associate of former Bosnian Serb president
Radovan Karadzic, who is also under indictment for war crimes and
remains the tribunal's most wanted man. Krajisnik was Karadzic's
deputy leader in the Serbian section of Bosnia, and he replaced
Karadzic as the leading Bosnian Serb politician after the charges
against Karadzic forced him to go underground.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in The Hague were jubilant because of the importance
of their catch, and because it was French troops who corralled him.
</P>
<P>
   They were also encouraged because it was the quickest arrest yet
in the tribunal's seven-year history. Krajisnik's secret indictment
and arrest warrant were handed up on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most significant arrest in the history of the
tribunal,'' said Paul Risley, a spokesman for Carla Del Ponte, the
chief prosecutor of the war crimes tribunal created by the United
Nations Security Council in 1993. ``This shows that NATO has the
will and the ability to go into any area and carry out the arrests
of individuals under indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the US ambassador to the UN and former US
special envoy to the Balkans, hailed Krajisnik's arrest as one of
the most significant advances in the region in the last five years
and praised the French soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is by far the most important indicted war criminal who was
picked up,'' Holbrooke told reporters at the United Nations.
``Because it is a secret indictment, it should warn people they may
not be as invulnerable as they think.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who brokered the 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the
Bosnian war, described Krajisnik as an ``out and out separatist and
a complete racist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the biggest break in our favor in a long time, because
it is a major blow to the separatists, racists, and murderers who
have been trying to thwart the single national concept that is at
the heart of Dayton,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, Krajisnik was the Serb representative on
the shared three-member presidency that rules Bosnia under the
Dayton Agreement. He is now a businessman whom western diplomats
have accused more recently of collaborating with the reputed
gangsters who run much of the Republika Srbska, the Serb section of
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors said they hoped that Krajisnik's arrest had
tightened the noose that is slowly closing around their most
coveted targets, Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the former head of the
Bosnian Serb army who carried out Karadzic's orders to rid Bosnia
of Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Karadzic, I wouldn't be sleeping too well tonight,''
said Risley.

CANDIDATES AND COMEDY: WHO'S WINNER? 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - With politicians clamoring to appear on late-night
talk shows _ the road to New York's U.S. Senate seat runs through
his studio, David Letterman boasts _ it's fair to ask the question:
How do the presidential hopefuls stack up as entertainers?
</P>
<P>
   And who better to answer than the guys at Comedy Central's
Indecision 2000 political team, who've enjoyed a front-row seat
during the presidential-primary season _ the best place from which
to lob the occasional journalistic cream pie?
</P>
<P>
   Like when a correspondent, playing off the Confederate flag flap
in South Carolina, asked John McCain whether the Dukes of Hazzard
should remove the flag from their car, the General Lee. Or would
that fall under the jurisdiction of the show's sheriff?
</P>
<P>
   ``He started waxing nostalgic about lessons he's learned from
Rosco P. Coltrane,'' says Stuart Bailey, a senior producer for
``The Daily'' ``Show With Jon Stewart'' (on which Indecision 2000
appears), of McCain. ``He doesn't miss a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   If you thought the national media loved McCain _ and they did _
the Indecision 2000 team practically worshiped the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after he dropped out, the flag at Comedy Central flew
at half-mast,'' correspondent Mo Rocca says. ``We liked him for the
same reason the `real' press kissed his ass for the last six
months: He was accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, despite a generally well-received guest spot on ``The
Tonight ``Show,'' McCain is now a roadside carcass on the
presidential highway, joined by other leading entertainment lights
who aspired to the nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw Gary Bauer come back to the hotel as a beaten, wee
man, it was the end of an era,'' Bailey says. Bauer made primary
sound-bite history by falling off a stage while attempting to flip
pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad for him as a candidate,'' Bailey says, ``but
professionally, I had to think, `All is right with the world.' That
was just a sheer delight, to see that. As if things couldn't go bad
enough for the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we're left with George W. Bush and Al Gore _ able
politicians, obviously, but not exactly Laurel and Hardy when it
comes to entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like it's going to be high comedy,'' Rocca
says. ``I hope we don't have to rely on banana peels.''
</P>
<P>
   All this a mere eight years after then-candidate Bill Clinton
was slammed for playing the saxophone on ``The Arsenio Hall Show.''
Demeaned the office, people complained. Now Bush, Gore and McCain
all have appeared on the late-night circuit, and no one debated
whether they should have. We debated whether they were funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance, even I would have to say, yeah, somehow maybe
it does demean the whole process,''
</P>
<P>
   Indecision 2000 correspondent Vance DeGeneres says ``that we're
electing not the new Johnny Carson but the most powerful man in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the other hand, somehow it makes me feel better that
there is a human side to the guy. It makes me feel a little safer.
I would worry about a guy who has no sense of humor about anything,
including himself.'''
</P>
<P>
   And with Steve Forbes out of the race, he won't have to.
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres' prediction probably won't come true _ that the
Letterman and Leno shows will replace the caucuses and primaries _
but there is no denying that politics and entertainment have become
as intertwined as Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee (when they're not
broken up).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's become more important because of the rise of
entertainment in general,'' Bailey says. ``People, for some strange
reason, know the box-office receipts of the weekend's movies. All
of a sudden, our entertainment knowledge, the base of it, has grown
so fast it's natural politics got sucked in as well.''
</P>
<P>
   If neither Bush nor Gore is a laugh riot, all hope is not lost
at Comedy Central. Bush's train-wreck appearance on Letterman (a
later Leno appearance went better) proves that anything can happen,
Bailey says. And Gore's contentious debate exchanges with Bill
Bradley sharpened his entertainment skills. Still, it won't be like
the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't phone it in anymore,'' Bailey says. ``When you have
interns in the White House, you just sit back and let the jokes
write themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And if all else fails ...
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't forget the potential bonanza that's known as the
Reform Party,'' Rocca says. ``You've got a gorgeous mosaic of
crackpots. It's the most delicious buffet of craziness. And what
better ringleader of this crazy circus than Pat Buchanan?''
</P>
<P>
   It may not replace ``ER,'' but at least it's something.

power by anti-competitive means.'' As a result, the company
``trammeled the competitive process through which the computer

COMMENTARY: DOWN FOR THE COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many of you out there have strong reservations about the
U.S. Census? May I see a show of hands?
</P>
<P>
   I thought so. Everybody's cool. Once again, the radio talk-show
circuit has plunged us into a violent debate about an issue that
stirs the passions of average Americans slightly less than the
cancellation of ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   You have no doubt received a census form, probably the short one
that takes just a few minutes to fill out. The long form, which
goes to about one-sixth of all American households, contains 53
questions, including whether your toilets flush and your relatives
are all in their right minds. The answers are going to remain
confidential for the next 72 years; at that point a Ph.D. candidate
may grant you immortality by writing a dissertation on your indoor
plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Census opponents appear to be mainly opponents of government,
period. (James Bovard, the author of ``Freedom in Chains,'' called
the census ``a scheme for generating grist for the expansion of the
welfare state.'') But they've created some nervous roiling in
Congress. Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska is working on legislation to
remove the $100 penalty for failure to answer the questions, even
though the fine hasn't been imposed in decades. He's being assisted
by Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia, a Democrat up for re-election
who's determined to leave no group unpandered to.
</P>
<P>
   The census is actually a noble public enterprise. It represents
the founding fathers' breakthrough concept that people should have
power not because of their property or titles, but simply because
they're there. If we cannot expect election-fevered politicians to
be reasonable about, say, Elian Gonzalez, it does seem they could
muster up the grit to tell folks that they should regard filling
out census forms like voting, and pretend to appreciate the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But George W. Bush regards the issue as too hot for rationality.
First he announced that ``all of us need to encourage people to
fill out the census,'' then instantly added that he could
understand why some ``don't want to give all that information to
the government. And if I had the long form I'm not sure I'd want
to, either.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bush said the governor had received the short
form, this year's equivalent of announcing you got a high draft
number.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said recently
that Lott was telling people to just skip over any question they
felt was intrusive. Now, the senator's constituents in Mississippi
make out like bandits when it comes to federal aid, receiving an
average of about $2,000 per person more than they pay in federal
taxes. On behalf of all the states that pay more than they get
back, let me say: Go to it, Mississippians. Skip the long forms,
and the short forms too. We'll give the money to some less
conflicted state, perhaps one that hasn't just received a contract
to build a monster aircraft carrier the Pentagon doesn't even want.
</P>
<P>
   We interrupt this harangue to report that Lott's office now says
the senator wants everybody to fill out the forms, and tells people
to skip questions only if they threaten to toss their forms into
the river unless their objections are met. When it comes to
penalties for non-compliance, his spokesman added, ``the senator is
completely agnostic.''
</P>
<P>
   This is possibly the first time in history that Lott's name has
been used in the same sentence with the word ``agnostic.''
</P>
<P>
   For every politician who's trying to distance himself from the
census, there are four others desperately trying to get their
constituents to fill out the forms, and raise their chances of
getting more federal aid. The governor of Georgia has gone on
television with an ad urging his state to cooperate ``or our
Georgia money will be educating New York children for another 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm a little wounded by that. Certainly we New Yorkers
disagree with Georgians about some minor matters, such as the
relative charms of John Rocker. But our elected officials _
appalling as they may be _ don't try to scare us into doing what
they want by threatening to give our tax dollars to kids in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Go yell at the Mississippians for a while.

Our rating: 2{ stars 
By DAVID KRONKE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' proves why the networks could never have made ``The
Sopranos.'' First, check out the cast of thugs and cops _ all are
blandly attractive and coolly vicious to the point of seeming
completely interchangeable, not like the colorful and distinctive
bunch on the acclaimed HBO series. Next, check out the tricky moral
quandaries _ or rather, the lack of same: You got your cops, you
got your gangsters, and they're all talking the same brand of
tough, and basically just circling one another endlessly, no one
apparently in charge, like sharks in a vortex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' (based on the feature film ``Donnie Brasco,'' itself
based on a true story) centers on Joe Falcone (Jason Gedrick), a
low-level soldier in the Volonte family mob by day and Joe Pistone,
family man, at night. Falcone has to walk the tricky minefield of
undercover agent in a deadly business filled with paranoia and
hair-trigger tempers; he's been at it for two years, which sort of
begs the question: Just how much extortion, robbery and murder does
he have to witness before the government has a case against these
guys, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   CBS is presenting nine episodes of ``Falcone'' over eight
nights, like a pseudo-miniseries, which is probably a good idea
because there's a lot of complicated duplicity and interconnected
plotting. The fact that everyone sort of looks and dresses the same
doesn't help alleviate the confusion. (Here's the easiest way to
tell this is a CBS series: The women in a strip club are more
covered than those in the average UPN series.)
</P>
<P>
   The main points are: Volonte's iced, and there's a scramble to
replace him (a whacked-out character in a prison psycho ward,
(over)played _ naturally _ by Eric Roberts gets the improbable
nod), forcing Falcone to choose his alliances carefully. Another,
sloppier, undercover agent is brought in when Falcone's captain,
Sonny (Titus Welliver), plans a major contracting scam with the
school board, imperiling both Pistone and his family. Other scams
and crimes (involving a purloined prize pooch and phony birth
certificates) keep the action burbling along. ``The Sopranos''
could make subplots like the contracting scam amusing; the stories
here are humorless (except for the fizzled dognapping yarn, which
falls flat) and, dramatically, register mere shrugs. When a goofy,
wanna-be mobster is introduced, you know immediately he's
ultimately going to be played for poignancy. Scenes with Pistone's
in-the-dark and not-quite-understanding family offer the weakest
material here _ on ``Sopranos,'' those scenes are often the best.
</P>
<P>
   And plotting at times seems iffy _ these crack federal
investigators can't seem to loosen some much-needed chump change to
make an undercover agent appear to be a serious player, but they
can clean out an entire house and relocate the family in it in an
hour's time.
</P>
<P>
   Gedrick's a little blank for the role _ he doesn't show us
Falcone's/Pistone's internal gears spinning when he needs to come
up with a quick-witted response when his cover's about to get
blown. Welliver is good at playing a cool facade with a short fuse,
and everyone else around him seems to be aping him. ``Falcone'' is
like ``The Fugitive'' in reverse, a cat-and-mouse game that both
shows promise and seems to come with a built-in short shelf life:
The deeper things get, the more difficult it will be to sustain
Pistone's alias and, of course, the guy's got to start making
arrests at some point.
</P>
<P>
   If viewers don't go for this hefty serving of ``Falcone''
quickly, however, it may be a moot point. It has its intriguing
moments, but if the network whacks the show, viewers will no doubt
respond with the sort of cold-eyed resignation virtually every
character here demonstrates.________ &QL; 
The show: ``Falcone.'' &QL; 
What: Miniseries of one-hour episodes about a fed undercover in the
mob. &QL; 
The stars: Jason Gedrick, Titus Welliver, Eric Roberts. &QL; 
Where: KCBS (Channel 2). &QL;

PEDRO MAKES THE DIFFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fortified by the addition of Peter Schourek (anagram
for RUTH KEEP SCORE), shaken by the sudden disgruntlement of
veteran Tim Wakefield, picked to win the World Series by Sports
Illustrated and Larry King, the Red Sox Tuesday night will be the
last American League team to take the field for the start of the
2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Pedro will be in the House. Always, things go better
when Pedro is in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The House could be Fenway Park, Safeco Field (where he'll start
against the Mariners Tuesday night), the Jimmy Fund Clinic, or the
Boston Sheraton grand ballroom for the annual Baseball Writers
dinner. Doesn't matter. When Pedro is in the House, it's an event.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's event is the first game of the second century of
Red Sox baseball. Pedro Martinez, winner of just about every award
(ESPN Magazine gave him an Oscar for being the ``Latin American
Beauty''), puts the Sox in position for a fast start.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Pedro is The Man. At home. On the road. At any
function. Fans line up four hours early if he's making a scheduled
autograph appearance. They bring baseballs for him to sign, babies
for him to kiss. A random Pedro sighting in a movie theater or
restaurant results in urgent phone calls that guarantee a crowd
will be waiting when he exits.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro is coming off the single greatest season of power and
precision pitching in the last 100 years (23-4, 2.07, 313
strikeouts, 37 walks), and life has changed for the diminutive
Dominican. He's still the Sox' clubhouse cutup, but it's getting
harder to live the everyday life he loves. Every stranger in the
street makes demands. Every charity wants him for its worthy cause.
Every reporter needs just one more quote. Most recently, SI put him
on its cover next to a headline that says the Red Sox will win the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not anything unusual,'' said the 28-year-old righty. ``I
was prepared for this. I was ready. I don't like it, but I have to
take it. To me, it's not anything that's going to take me by
surprise. I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm in and I know what
it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   He already has warned the world that it's not fair to expect a
repeat of his 1999 performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, they can't expect more than 100 percent,'' he said.
``That's all I'm gonna give.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, 100 percent has done the job for the fandom. Pedro
has been a member of the Red Sox for only two seasons, but his
popularity already has outstripped that of Roger Clemens in his
prime. Luis Tiant, Fred Lynn, Carlton Fisk, and Nomar Garciaparra
have enjoyed the adulation of Red Sox Nation, but not since Carl
Yastrzemski (circa 1967) has any Sox player enjoyed the godlike
status that engulfs Pedro today.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's ready for the season. The Sox were a
worst-in-the-majors 11-19 in Florida and Arizona, but Pedro got his
work in, pitching 15 2/3 innings in five games, allowing eight runs
and 17 hits while fanning 20 and walking only two.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this time of year, I'm where I want to be,'' he said.
``I'm healthy and that's all I need. All the rest is just a matter
of time and playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he made his Boston debut, striking out 11 in
seven innings of a shutout victory over the Oakland A's. Last year
he took the opening act to Kansas City and again fanned 11 in
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But there was never the spotlight and expectation like now. ESPN
altered the American League schedule in order to televise Pedro's
2000 debut. Pedro games are certified hardball events. His next
start is Sunday in Anaheim (the master's gifts are wasted on Orange
County casuals) and we don't yet know whether his Fenway debut will
be next Friday or Saturday. It matters if you're sharing a
season-ticket package with your brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about all the attention,'' he said. ``I'll be
me no matter how much they ask for me, how much they do, or what
they do. I can't change. I can only be me and that's the only one I
know how to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still having fun. I wouldn't say as much fun as ever, but
it's a lot of fun. It's just busy. It's busier now than it was
before. But that's what they pay you for.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he'll be careful not to let his celebrity intefere with
his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing everybody's gotta be clear: when I gotta work, when
I have to do my job, I don't care how much you clap, how loud you
are, I have a job to do,'' he said. ``That's pretty much it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 2000 Sox. Is this really the year?
</P>
<P>
   ``What they say is one thing and what we do on the field is
another thing,'' said Pedro. ``We're a big league team and better
on paper than we were last year. We're the only ones that beat the
Yankees in the playoffs. What else do we have to do? Just play.
Come ask us in November. See where we finish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 162 to play,'' said manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night is Game No. 1. It's the start. And the Red Sox go
to battle with the best starter in all of baseball. Tune in at
8:05. Pedro will be in the House.

 &HT;    FEDERAL OFFICIALS LOOK TO TURN ELIAN OVER TO FATHER _ SOON
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With a tense Miami waiting, federal immigration
officials said Monday they will order the Miami relatives of
6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez to turn the boy over to his
father , who could come to the U.S. from Cuba as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to reunite Elian and his father,'' said Maria
Cardona, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ``The issue is not whether we will transfer Elian to his
father, but when and how.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, U.S. State Department officials said that travel
visas had been approved for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
his immediate family and three other people _ a pediatrician, a
psychologist and one of Elian's favorite cousins. The group might
come to the U.S. as soon as Tuesday, according to unconfirmed media
reports.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami's volatile Cuban exiles continued to vow they would
block any attempt to take Elian from the Little Havana home where
he has been living with his Miami relatives, with some predicting
bloodshed if federal agents come for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be thousands here to stop it if they come for
him,'' said Ana Bonnin, one of about 100 exiles who practiced
forming a human chain outside the home Monday. ``We'll try to do it
peacefully, but you can only do so much. You can't control
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, lawyers for Elian's Miami family emerged from
their third day-long meeting with federal officials, but said
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be very concerned about the mental and
psychological well-being of this 6-year-old,'' said Manny Diaz, one
of the family's attorneys. ``To that end, we'll be back tomorrow to
continue our negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials made no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the Gonzalez family would come to Miami
to get Elian or if instead they would travel to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has said they would live in the
home of a Cuban diplomat in the Washington area until the court
case surrounding Elian's fate is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Visas for the entourage of more than 20 teachers, classmates and
others _ including Ricardo Alarcon, Cuban National Assembly
president _ that Castro wants to accompany the family were not yet
approved, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of events caps a four-month ordeal that has seen Elian
catapulted into the center an international tug-of-war. He was
found floating in an inner-tube off the Florida coast on
Thanksgiving Day after a boat carrying him from Cuba sank. His
mother and 10 other people drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials placed him with his Miami relatives, but kept
custody over him. In January, Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner ruled that Elian should go back
to Cuba, a decision upheld by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives filed a federal lawsuit to overturn the
decision, but in March a Miami federal judge ruled against them.
They immediately appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts and federal officials maintain that Reno can allow
the boy to be sent back to Cuba before the appeal is heard.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, federal officials sought to have the family must sign
an agreement to turn the boy over voluntarily should they lose
their appeal. If the family refused, INS had threatened to revoke
Elian's parole, meaning federal officials would take him from the
Miami family.
</P>
<P>
   The family refused to sign the agreement through two days of
negotiations, and INS extended its deadline until 9 a.m. EST
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the talks changed dramatically, however, when
Castro announced last Wednesday that the boy's father was ready to
travel to the United States. Previously, Gonzalez had said he would
never come here to get his son.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, lawyers for the family raised accusations that
Juan Miguel Gonzalez had mistreated his son in telephone
conversations, saying he had told the boy that his mother was alive
and waiting for him in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But by Monday, federal officials hardened their negotiating
stance, insisting the boy would be turned over to his father once
the Cuban group arrives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moves to keep Elian in this country through federal legislation
appear to be stymied, as most lawmakers seem to agree the boy
should go back to Cuba. A new ABC News-Washington Post opinion poll
shows that 6 of 10 Americans also believe the boy should go home
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami, Cuban exiles insist the majority of Americans
don't understand the dynamics of life in Cuba. Just how far they
are willing to go to prove their point remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he goes back, he won't be with his real father,'' said
Elias Hernandez, who joined the crowd outside the Little Havana
home of Elian's Miami relatives. ``His father will be Fidel Castro,
the worst dictator in history.''

AUTO INDUSTRY SALES ACCELERATE FOR BEST QUARTER IN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Americans bought new cars, minivans and sport utility
vehicles at a sizzling pace last month, closing out the best
quarter ever for the auto industry as the nation's economy appeared
to be following up a winter of brisk economic growth with a
springtime of continued strong expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor said Monday its sales in the United States leaped 7.2
percent from a year earlier to the company's highest level ever for
any month. Four other big automakers had their best March ever:
DaimlerChrysler, up 4.4 percent from last year; Toyota, up 16
percent; Honda, up 20.3 percent; and Mitsubishi, up 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's overall pace of sales rose by nearly 9 percent
from a year earlier, but did not set a record and was a little
weaker than in February. The reason was simple: General Motors
offered generous discount coupons in February which produced a
sharp jump in sales then, followed by weaker sales last month. GM's
sales climbed only 1 percent in March from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ward's Auto Infobank, a data research firm, estimated that GM's
market share fell last month to 27.4 percent, well below the
company's target of 30 percent. Paul Ballew, GM's general director
of global market and industry analysis, said that sales last month
suffered because of the marketing campaign in February. The
campaign was aimed at existing owners of GM automobiles, who tend
to buy GM models sooner or later and sometimes time their purchases
to take advantage of discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers' announcements Monday of robust auto sales
coincided with the release of a national survey by the National
Association of Purchasing Managers, which also showed that the
economy continued to grow vigorously last month.
</P>
<P>
   Auto sales and the purchasing managers' survey are usually the
first statistics released each month about the strength of the
economy the month before. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the
Federal Reserve, has long watched auto sales particularly closely,
having first earned his reputation as an economic forecaster in the
1950s and 1960s while specializing in the steel and auto
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Diane C. Swonk, a senior vice president and chief economist at
the Bank One Corp., said rising interest rates and higher gasoline
prices seemed to be having little effect so far on the auto
industry, traditionally a sector particularly sensitive to rates
and gas prices. Battling for market share, automakers have been
offering low rates on auto loans, thereby insulating their
customers so far from the Fed's attempts to raise short-term rates
and slow economic growth to a more sustainable level
</P>
<P>
   ``Vehicle sales are one of the primary reasons why consumer
spending seems to be accelerating even from the frenzied pace of
the fourth quarter,'' Swonk said. ``It does up the ante in terms of
how far the Fed has to go when the automakers are offering 0.9
percent financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark M. Cornelius, the president of Morgan &AMP; Co. Inc., an auto
forecasting and consulting company in West Olive, Mich., estimated
that for March alone, the industry's sales rose 8.3 percent from a
year earlier, running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   The overall first quarter was even better. Ballew, GM's senior
market analyst, said the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales
for all of the first quarter was about 18.5 million automobiles,
beating the previous record of 18.2 million, set in the third
quarter of last year. He predicted that sales would moderate
somewhat by the end of this year, particularly because of the Fed's
actions, but said that the moderation would not turn into a sharp
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The steep increase in gasoline prices during March appeared to
have little effect on the types of automobiles that Americans
wanted to buy. Sales of minivans soared while sales of
gas-guzzling, full-size SUVs and pickup trucks were fairly strong.
There was some weakness in sales of small pickups, which tend to be
the most fuel-efficient light trucks, although they still get much
worse gas mileage than cars.
</P>
<P>
   Ballew said that market share gains would slow somewhat for
these vehicles over the next few years, as most automakers, with
the exception of GM, have slowed their introductions of such
models. ``Some of the extraordinary shifts we've seen in the last
10 years are beginning to ebb a bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's sales rose 23.4 percent last month from a year earlier,
although it was not the company's best March ever. Subaru posted
its best March since 1989, with a 4.7 percent gain, while
Volkswagen had its best March since 1979, with a 19.6 percent
increase.

 &HT;    FEDERAL OFFICIALS LOOK TO TURN ELIAN OVER TO FATHER _ SOON
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With a tense Miami waiting, federal immigration
officials said Monday they will order the Miami relatives of
6-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez to turn the boy over to his
father , who could come to the U.S. from Cuba as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to reunite Elian and his father,'' said Maria
Cardona, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service. ``The issue is not whether we will transfer Elian to his
father, but when and how.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, U.S. State Department officials said that travel
visas had been approved for Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
his immediate family and three other people _ a pediatrician, a
psychologist and one of Elian's favorite cousins. The group might
come to the U.S. as soon as Tuesday, according to unconfirmed media
reports.
</P>
<P>
   But Miami's volatile Cuban exiles continued to vow they would
block any attempt to take Elian from the Little Havana home where
he has been living with his Miami relatives, with some predicting
bloodshed if federal agents come for the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be thousands here to stop it if they come for
him,'' said Ana Bonnin, one of about 100 exiles who practiced
forming a human chain outside the home Monday. ``We'll try to do it
peacefully, but you can only do so much. You can't control
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, lawyers for Elian's Miami family emerged from
their third day-long meeting with federal officials, but said
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be very concerned about the mental and
psychological well-being of this 6-year-old,'' said Manny Diaz, one
of the family's attorneys. ``To that end, we'll be back tomorrow to
continue our negotiations.''
</P>

RULING COULD ENCOURAGE SUITS AGAINST SOFTWARE GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp., absorbing a harsh blow in its
antitrust battle with the government, now faces another big legal
problem: Monday's ruling gives a boost to scores of private
antitrust cases against the company.
</P>
<P>
   At least 120 companies and individuals have filed their own
actions against Microsoft. Most charge that the software giant
abused its monopoly power to keep software prices high and to
stifle rival products, which might have been cheaper and more
innovative than Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers bringing these cases are organized. More than 50 of
them met in Washington in January to swap strategy and coordinate
requests for documents and depositions from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Their effort got fresh fuel as Federal District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson concluded that Microsoft broke antitrust laws in
trying to protect its Windows monopoly and in attempting to
dominate the market for Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   All of the private antitrust plaintiffs must prove that
Microsoft is a monopoly, or their claims will be rejected. But now
that Jackson has called Microsoft a monopoly, and is certain to
repeat that conclusion in his final judgment expected later this
year, lawyers in the private cases can merely point to Jackson's
ruling to prove that part of their argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a third or half of the work, establishing that a
company has monopoly power,'' said Rich Gray, a Menlo Park, Calif.,
antitrust lawyer who is following the Microsoft case closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'll see a lot of other cases climbing out of the
woodwork against Microsoft,'' said Charles Haworth, a former law
professor now with Owens, Clary &AMP; Aiken in Dallas. ``I think their
problems are just beginning. It's a nightmare for the company, no
doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Chesley, a Cincinatti lawyer leading the drive to
organize plantiffs attorneys against Microsoft, said Jackson's
ruling was ``very helpful'' to the private cases. ``We're going to
be able to utilize that. These private persons have rights, and we
have every intention of pursuing all of our remedies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the lawyers bringing suits against Microsoft have
experience in taking on the tobacco, breast implant and vitaman
supplement industries.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the private cases could become a major problem for
Microsoft is that most seek to be certified as class actions
representing thousands of plaintiffs. And under federal law, a
defendent found guilty of antitrust violations must pay triple the
actual damages to each plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   One Massachusetts case, filed by Michael Germano of Wilmington,
seeks to represent all Massachusetts residents who bought or
licensed Microsoft's Windows operating system or its Internet
browser, called Internet Explorer, for use but not for resale.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says that because of Microsoft's illegal behavior,
consumers were not able to buy computer operating systems or Web
browsers ``at prices determined by free and open competition,'' and
that they paid more for Windows and Internet Explorer than they
would have in a competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cullinan, a spokesman for Microsoft, rejected that argument
and the company's liability in the other private lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The class action litigations are about overcharging,
basically, and there's nothing in the record of the DOJ (Department
of Justice) trial that addressed such a thing,'' Cullinan said.
``Microsoft's whole business model is high volume and low prices,
so we severely doubt that even a finding of monopoly power by the
court will help in the overcharging issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that complaints about overcharging for Windows ``are
completely without merit, and are an effort by plaintiffs'
attorneys just to go after a successful company.''
</P>
<P>
   In their suit, the US Justice Department and state prosecutors
did not seek damages on behalf of consumers, even though they had
the right to, Attorney General Tom Miller of Iowa said. The
government's suit was massive even without making that effort, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's recent experience as an antitrust defendant has been
mixed. In January, it paid an estimated $275 million to settle
charges brought by Caldera Inc., a small Salt Lake City company
that claimed Microsoft competed unfairly in the market for MS-DOS
operating system software. The settlement forced Microsoft to take
a charge of 3 cents per share in the quarter ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, however, Microsoft won a federal jury trial in which
a small Connecticut company, Bristol Technology Inc. of Danbury,
said the software giant improperly withheld software code that
Bristol needed for its survival.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ``findings of law'' followed his Nov. 5 ``findings of
fact.'' Barring a last-minute settlement between Microsoft and the
government, Jackson will issue a final judgment that incorporates
those two sets of findings.
</P>
<P>
   Private plaintiffs will likely want to cite the final judgment,
rather than Jackson's earlier findings, in their own cases. Because
Jackson's rulings so far have been harsh in their assessment of
Microsoft, the final judgment is expected to hit the company hard
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Aiding the private cases is a set of legal principles that say a
party, once it has had the chance to fully litigate an issue,
should not be given the chance to debate it all over again in a
different court. ``These plaintiffs will argue that Microsoft,
having had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues that
led to the judge's conclusions, should not be able to relitigate
those issues in another forum,'' Haworth said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the judicial system has already settled the
question of whether Microsoft is a monopoly. Other aspects of
Jackson's rulings may be useful to private plaintiffs, as well.
However, each plaintiff will still have to prove it suffered harm
because Microsoft illegally used its monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   When facing the private suits, Microsoft can draw little comfort
from the fact that Jackson rejected some of the government's
charges, as private plaintiffs are free to raise those claims
again, Haworth said. To bar them from doing so would deprive
plaintiffs of due process rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal suits against Microsoft, the discovery process _
the process of requesting documents and depositions from parties in
a case _ will likely be consolidated before a single federal court.
</P>
<P>
   After discovery, the federal suits would be tried in the courts
in which they were filed. More than 60 of the suits filed so far
have been brought in federal court, and about 50 in state courts.

MICROSOFT RULING COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT COPORATE FOES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft's antitrust trial ultimately may bite the
software industry that bore and fed it, or harm the consumers whose
dollars have built the industry into the powerhouse it has become.
</P>
<P>
   It was competitors' complaints about Microsoft's monopoly in
Intel-based PC operating systems that led to Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson's ruling Monday that the company had violated the Sherman
Antitrust Act, as the Justice Department and 19 states had claimed
in their 1998 lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp. led the parade, and Sun
Microsystems, Intel, Compaq, RealNetworks, IBM, Apple Computer and
others testified at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Microsoft has been judged a monopolist that has
harmed consumers, and the time has arrived to consider how to
punish it, the companies are pulling back.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's Scott McNealy has urged that Microsoft not be dismembered,
as some states and the Department of Justice are said to be
advocating. McNealy says he opposes such a so-called ``structural
remedy'' only because the pieces would each continue to offend, not
because the company doesn't deserve to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft's competitors warn, though, that any punishment
eventually decided upon by the court musn't interfere with
Microsoft's productivity. The entire computer industry realizes
that Microsoft's success is essential to its own. For example, on
May 1, 1998, executives of 26 of the nation's largest technology
companies urged the Justice Department not to block release of
Windows 98, out of concern about how that might affect them and the
industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Changing some of Microsoft's conduct, like insisting it separate
Internet Explorer from Windows, probably wouldn't pose a problem to
the industry. But other provisions the government wants, like
sharing the source code for Windows with partners or the public,
present their own set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers may find, for example, that the ease with which they
can read a document or spreadsheet created by a friend or colleague
may diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Assume for example that Microsoft is forced (or agrees) to share
the source code, or blueprints, for current and future versions of
its Windows operating system. That may lead to the release of
multiple versions of Windows as companies or individuals
``improve'' it. The Linux community, where open source code has
been most successful, calls that process forking. Over time, some
forked versions will gain features other lack. That means files
created on one machine might not be fully usable, or usable at all,
on another.
</P>
<P>
   People who have used computers since before Windows achieved its
97 percent market share may recall the not-so-good-old days in the
early 1990s when Apple, DOS, OS/2 and Windows were battling for
market share. No developer wanted to waste time and money writing
word-processing, spreadsheet, database, and myriad other
applications for operating systems that weren't likely to capture a
big share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   So they invariably chose one or maybe two to develop for. As a
result, people often couldn't read files created by colleagues or
friends. As Windows gained market share, more applications were
written for it, which, in a classic chicken-and-egg situation,
helped it gain yet more market share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, of course, likes this argument _ it suggests that its
monopoly evolved naturally as a result of consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   From a software developer's view, too, the lack of a single
operating system made developing new products more expensive and
time consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Now we may begin reliving those days.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   If government regulators take a lesson from the Linux community,
economic and social pressures, and possibly licensing requirements,
could help prevent Windows splitting the operating system into too
many and too varied versions or ``forks.''
</P>
<P>
   Socially, ``anyone who forks gets really punished, because the
culture frowns on it'' as unfair, said Tim Bird, the chief
technology officer for embedded-Linux vendor Lineo. In terms of
economics, it doesn't make sense, Bird said.

   NEW YORK _ The Nasdaq stock market, the source of much of the
new wealth created during the 1990s, lost a big chunk of its value
Monday, recording its fifth-biggest decline ever in percentage
terms.
</P>
<P>
   After news over the weekend that settlement efforts had ended
between Microsoft and the government in its landmark antitrust
case, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite moved sharply lower
from the start of trading.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and traders said that many of its stocks were
poised for a fall anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This correction was going to unfold regardless'' of the
Microsoft announcement, said Michael Molnar, a managing director in
equity sales and trading at Salomon Smith Barney. ``All sorts of
signs of speculative excess is being wrung out of the Nasdaq.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, the Nasdaq composite index had plummeted
349.15, or 7.6 percent, to 4223.68. It was the biggest percentage
decline in the Nasdaq since Aug. 31, 1998, and the biggest point
drop ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of good news for stock investors, the money flooding
out of Internet and technology stocks did not flee the stock market
completely. It was redirected into high-quality blue chip stocks,
which a number of analysts had called undervalued. Among the
beneficiaries were financial stocks, like J.P. Morgan and American
Express, and drug companies, like Merck.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's 7.6 decline in the Nasdaq composite came on top of a
drop of more than 7 percent in March. The index is now down nearly
15 percent from its peak on March 10. Still, because of its
tremendous run-up this year, the index has wiped out only two
months of investor gains. For perspective, the index closed on
April 1, 1999, at 2,493.37.
</P>
<P>
   Lise Beyer, director of Internet/New Media research at Credit
Suisse First Boston, said, ``We bid these stocks up too high and
will probably bid them down too low.''
</P>
<P>
   Molnar and Beyer were reluctant to predict an end to the
selling. But they noted that technology companies will begin to
report earnings figures next week, figures that they expect will be
very good.
</P>
<P>
   While wiping out billions in paper wealth, Microsoft fell from
its perch as the biggest company in the world measured by market
capitalization. The stock declined 15 3/8 Monday, and closed at 90
7/8. In after-hours activity, the shares were slightly higher. The
loss in the regular trading session was the biggest point drop for
Microsoft since Oct. 26, 1987, the week after the stock market
crash. Roughly 130 million Microsoft shares were traded , more than
triple its average daily volume this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Landis, portfolio manager of the Firsthand Funds, a San
Jose, Calif., mutual fund family that has $7 billion invested
entirely in technology stocks, sounded sanguine about the Microsoft
case and the outlook for technology stocks in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably a good day to round out out your position if
you are of a mind to,'' said Landis, who has a core holding in
Microsoft in Firsthand's Technology Leaders fund. ``I have been
trying to remember a lawsuit over technology where the technology
involved wasn't obsolete by the time the legal situation was
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq downdraft, he continued, is simply a correction for
stocks that have been overpriced. ``This feels very similar to the
dynamic we had in October of 1998,'' he said. ``The selling
pressure back then came to a screeching halt when the companies
started to report and said that business was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Landis said his view could change if earnings reports do not
revive stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies really beat the earnings numbers and the stocks
don't take off, then there is something else going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares were battered almost across the board Monday:
86 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index fell in price.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, a component of the S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq
composite, dropped 4 3/8, to 72 15/16. Qualcomm shed 8 9/16, to 140
3/4. eBay slumped 32 3/4, to 143 1/4. And America Online lost 2
3/4, to 64 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   In the flight to quality, stocks of Internet companies, many of
which have yet to record a profit, were crushed. TheStreet.com's
Internet Sector index plunged 109, or nearly 10 percent, to 998.

&HT;     JUDGE RULES MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTI-TRUST LAWS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. violated the nation's anti-trust
laws by illegally using its dominant position in the computer
software industry to stifle competition and hurt consumers in an
attempt to ``monopolize'' the Internet browser market, a federal
judged ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft placed an oppressive thumb on the scales of market
fortune,'' U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said
in his 50-page ruling of law, delivering a resounding but not
unexpected defeat to the company that has been a cornerstone in the
heated technology economy.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the software giant violated the anti-trust laws
laid out in the 1890 Sherman Act by maintaining its monopoly power
through ``anti-competitive means'' and ``attempting to monopolize''
the Web browser market. Internet browsers allow users access to the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jackson has handed down his verdict, the case moves
into the remedy phase. Among the possible remedies that Jackson
will consider are imposing fines on Microsoft, restricting its
conduct in the marketplace, and in the most extreme case, breaking
up the corporation. This decision could come later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said that Microsoft violated anti-trust rules by
``unlawfully tying its Web browser to its (Windows) operating
system.'' A computer's operating system is the core program that
allows other programs, such as word processing, to operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft trammeled the competitive process through which the
software industry normally innovates and hurt consumers through its
actions,'' said Jackson, who added that the company could be sued
under state anti-competition laws.
</P>
<P>
   Because Windows runs 95 percent of all computers, Jackson said,
Microsoft's bundling, or tying together, of its operating system
and its Internet browser meant that browser competitors _ such as
the Netscape Communications Corp., now part of America Online _
were at a severe disadvantage when it comes to selling their own
products. This Microsoft practice led to less competition and less
innovation, which hurt consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a press conference in Redmond, Wash., Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates promised to appeal Jackson's decision, arguing that his
company's browser is not a separate product but an integrated
feature of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we did everything we could to settle this case, we
believe we have a strong case on appeal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals could last two years.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gates said his company was still open to talks with the
Justice Department and the 19 states and District of Columbia that
brought the suit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At a Washington news conference, Joel I. Klein, who brought the
case for the government as chief of the Justice Department's
antitrust division, praised the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson's ruling will open the door to competition,
innovation and choice in the software industry,'' he said. ``It
will lay the ground rules for the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said: ``Microsoft has been held
accountable for its illegal conduct by a court of law. Thanks to
this ruling, consumers who have been harmed can now look forward to
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge accepted 23 of 26 arguments brought forth by the
states that joined the federal government in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling had been expected to go against Microsoft
based on harsh assessments he outlined in November in his findings
of fact. In that document, Jackson found that Microsoft repeatedly
engaged in anti-competitive behavior by taking advantage of its
monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson delayed issuing his ruling until after U.S.
stock markets had closed for the day, his anticipated harsh verdict
sent Microsoft stock down 15 3/8 to 90 7/8 on the Nasdaq exchange,
slicing $78 billion from the company's total capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft plunge triggered a record selloff in Nasdaq
stocks, sending the index down 349.15, or 7.6 percent, to close at
4,223.68. It was easily the Nasdaq's worst point drop in history,
surpassing a 229-point plunge on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling followed the collapse of settlement talks
between Microsoft and the Justice Department on Saturday. Chicago
appellate court Judge Richard Posner, whom Jackson appointed as a
mediator in November, said in a statement that the differences were
``too deep-seated'' to forge an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the failed talks, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that negotiations in Chicago collapsed after the
company insisted on its own proposal to settle the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became obvious that Microsoft was rejecting the
government's proposal and demanding their own approach,'' one
government source said. ``But their plan was filled with loopholes
and wouldn't have been effective or even workable.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a Saturday news conference, Gates blamed the failure of
the talks on the Department of Justice and the states, which he
said were not working together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between them, they appeared to be demanding either a breakup
of our company or other extreme concessions,'' said Gates, who did
not provide details of the company's offer to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Monday's Wall Street Journal, Gates also said
that regardless of Jackson's ruling, his company would continue to
integrate the company's Internet browser into its Windows software,
even though that linkage is at the core of the Justice Department
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling is just a step in the legal process. It doesn't
change any situation relative to what we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal rejected Gates'
claim that the settlement talks failed because of a gulf between
the Justice Department and 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The differences between the states and the Department of
Justice are minimal when compared to the divergence between our
side and Microsoft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson now will begin designing a remedy to the violations he
cited in his ruling. According to antitrust specialists familiar
with case, the judge likely will pick among one of three possible
settlements:
</P>
<P>
   _ Creating separate companies for operating systems,
applications software and the Internet. Gates would be allowed to
run only one of these companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, separate Bell telephone companies
were created to provide local service, while AT&AMP;T remained a
long-distance provider. The irony of this is that, if the AT&AMP;T
precedent prevails, the separate parts could eventually be worth
more than the whole, so Gates, a billionaire many times over, could
end up with even more wealth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keeping Microsoft intact but allow other companies to produce
their own versions of Windows, either by having Microsoft auction
off the rights to produce the software or by publishing Windows'
secret application program interfaces, or APIs, which run the
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring Microsoft to publish these interfaces and explain how
they work would help quell much of the criticism logged against the
company from its competitors. APIs are the software hooks that
enable other companies' programs, from word processors to games, to
run on Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some software developers contend that Microsoft has ``hidden
APIs'' in Windows that give a leg up to its own applications and
favored partners. Microsoft says that is untrue. Other software
developers alleged that the real problem is that the API
documentation from Microsoft is often misleading or erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leaving Microsoft and its monopoly status intact but imposing
specific rules on its behavior toward customers and competitors,
although this type of arrangement might require a huge Justice
Department enforcement effort.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the government ``will seek a remedy that prevents
Microsoft from using its monopoly in the future to stifle
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The states and the Justice Department will have to iron out any
differences in their approaches to a remedy. The states reportedly
are seeking to break up the company, while the Justice Department
is willing to accept less harsh terms.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of private litigation was seen as a major incentive
for Microsoft to settle. Several private antitrust lawsuits have
been filed against the company in anticipation of a guilty verdict.
With Jackson's finding that Microsoft violated the law, private
plaintiffs need only to prove that the software giant harmed them
through its actions.

U.S. READY FOR MUCH LARGER SECURITY COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After years of trying to hold the 15-member
Security Council to what it considers a manageable size, the United
States is prepared to drop its insistence that the limit should be
20 or 21 seats in any expansion, Richard Holbrooke, the American
ambassador to the United Nations, told a General Assembly working
group Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who did not suggest an upper number, is facing an
uphill battle to reduce American dues to the organization. And the
issue of Security Council size is important for dozens of new
members, whose ambassadors here contend that the council no longer
represents the world.
</P>
<P>
   The five permanent members _ Britain, China, France, Russia and
the United States _ have held those positions since 1945, when the
United Nations had 51 members. The 10 rotating seats are shared by
183 other countries, some of which are unlikely ever to have a
chance at membership. The rotating seats are held for two years,
with five new members elected each year to maintain overlap.
</P>
<P>
   The council, something of a United Nations cabinet of countries,
is the only body that can call for enforcement of its decisions by
military means, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Several years of sometimes rancorous debate in an open-ended
working group _ envoys call it the ``never-ending working group'' _
have failed to bring any voluntary changes in membership. Europe,
for example, can also hold one or two rotating seats in addition to
its three permanent ones, if Russia is counted. And many nations
say the time has come to discuss one or two permanent seats for the
European Union, to be apportioned as they choose. France and
Britain are resolutely opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is further complicated by German and Italian
demands for permanent seats, which carry veto powers. Japan is also
campaigning for a permanent place, citing its high level of
contributions and the need for a democratic free-market Asian voice
among the most powerful nations.
</P>
<P>
   Most delegations say the council is out of date in not giving
enough seats _ and no permanent seats _ to the developing countries
that form a substantial numerical majority in the General Assembly.
Those nations themselves are a long way from deciding which would
hold seats if the number is increased.
</P>
<P>
   India desperately wants one. But Indonesia and maybe even Korea
may also still be in the running from Asia. Africa has an abundance
of candidates, among them Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa. In Latin
America, Brazil and Mexico, and possibly Argentina or even Chile,
would be among the competitors.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Richardson, now energy secretary, was the ambassador
here, he suggested an additional five seats, for Germany, Japan and
three developing nations. That would put the membership at 20.
</P>
<P>
   Now members are proposing a body as large as 28 members, nearly
double its present size.

AG SAYS BAY STATE WANTS TO LEAD NATION IN GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the announcement that he will start enforcing
tough consumer protection laws against the gun industry, Attorney
General Thomas Reilly declared an ambitious goal Monday: not just
to change Massachusetts, but to lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts will be the first state, Reilly said, to use its
consumer protection regulations to prohibit the sale of guns
without tamper-resistant serial numbers, child-protection features,
trigger locks, and other safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   And even as gun industry advocates questioned his motives, and
some lawmakers took steps to challenge his authority, Reilly said
his tactics ought to set a new example. In triumphant tones, he
pledged to guide other state attorneys general, and declared
Massachusetts ``a national model...as to how we can stand up
against the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   And John Rosenthal, chairman of the Newton-based group Stop
Handgun Violence, declared Massachusetts ``the gun control capital
of America.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same banner Chicago and New Orleans waved in 1998, when
they led a succession of cities that filed lawsuits to hold the gun
industry liable for the medical and social costs of gun violence.
Some of those suits have since been dismissed, and some are now
pending in court.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the prospect of a wave of Reilly followers worries Bob
Delfey, president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the
nation's largest gun manufacturers' trade association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very possible other attorneys general will do this,''
Delfey said, predicting that each new state will attempt even
tougher regulations, in order to stay on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to want to go one up,'' Delfey said. ``They're
going to want the headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   In both the courts and the political arena, the fight over gun
control has increasingly become a game of brinksmanship. And the
scene in Massachusetts Monday was no different, as each side used
high-flying rhetoric and duelling statistics, and each challenged
the other side's motives.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and his supporters said Massachusetts' strict gun safety
regulations, passed in 1997 and upheld by state courts last month,
are common-sense provisions that should not impede the lawful use
of guns. The gun industry's ongoing resistance, he said, is ``based
upon their decision to put profits ahead of safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But Delfey said gun accidents are actually on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firearms are incredibly safe, reliable instruments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Yacino, executive director of the state Gun Owners'
Action League, said Massachusetts' rules won't solve the problem of
gun violence, and could harm law-abiding citizens who need their
guns in emergencies, when they ``don't have time to dig for your
little key.''
</P>
<P>
   Yacino questioned whether Reilly was trying to lay the
foundations for a gubernatorial bid. And Delfey said the timing of
Reilly's announcement was suspect. It came just days after U.S.
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo and New York
Attorney General Elliot Spitzer gained national headlines with a
gun announcement of their own: that manufacturer Smith &AMP; Wesson
Corp. would sign a code of conduct, agreeing to install safety
locks and ``smart gun'' technology.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson may now emerge as one of the few manufacturers
whose models can be sold in Massachusetts, Reilly said, since he
plans to enforce the state's rules immediately.
</P>
<P>
   And though Reilly insisted that ``it's not our intent to put gun
dealers out of business,'' some predicted that his actions could
effectively shut down gun sales in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether these gun manufacturers are going to be
able to meet all the standards that are in here...they'll stop
shipping firearms into the state,'' said Rep. George Peterson, a
Grafton Republican. ``My sense is, he's trying to shut dealers down
through the regulatory process.''

MICROSOFT RULING COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT COPORATE FOES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Microsoft's antitrust trial ultimately may bite the
software industry that bore and fed it, or harm the consumers whose
dollars have built the industry into the powerhouse it has become.
</P>
<P>
   It was competitors' complaints about Microsoft's monopoly in
Intel-based PC operating systems that led to Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson's ruling Monday that the company had violated the Sherman
Antitrust Act, as the Justice Department and 19 states had claimed
in their 1998 lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp. led the parade, and Sun
Microsystems, Intel, Compaq, RealNetworks, IBM, Apple Computer and
others testified at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Microsoft has been judged a monopolist that has
harmed consumers, and the time has arrived to consider how to
punish it, the companies are pulling back.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's Scott McNealy has urged that Microsoft not be dismembered,
as some states and the Department of Justice are said to be
advocating. McNealy says he opposes such a so-called ``structural
remedy'' only because the pieces would each continue to offend, not
because the company doesn't deserve to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft's competitors warn, though, that any punishment
eventually decided upon by the court musn't interfere with
Microsoft's productivity. The entire computer industry realizes
that Microsoft's success is essential to its own. For example, on
May 1, 1998, executives of 26 of the nation's largest technology
companies urged the Justice Department not to block release of
Windows 98, out of concern about how that might affect them and the
industry as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Changing some of Microsoft's conduct, like insisting it separate
Internet Explorer from Windows, probably wouldn't pose a problem to
the industry. But other provisions the government wants, like
sharing the source code for Windows with partners or the public,
present their own set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers may find, for example, that the ease with which they
can read a document or spreadsheet created by a friend or colleague
may diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Assume for example that Microsoft is forced (or agrees) to share
the source code, or blueprints, for current and future versions of
its Windows operating system. That may lead to the release of
multiple versions of Windows as companies or individuals
``improve'' it. The Linux community, where open source code has
been most successful, calls that process forking. Over time, some
forked versions will gain features other lack. That means files
created on one machine might not be fully usable, or usable at all,
on another.
</P>
<P>
   People who have used computers since before Windows achieved its
97 percent market share may recall the not-so-good-old days in the
early 1990s when Apple, DOS, OS/2 and Windows were battling for
market share. No developer wanted to waste time and money writing
word-processing, spreadsheet, database, and myriad other
applications for operating systems that weren't likely to capture a
big share of the market.
</P>
<P>
   So they invariably chose one or maybe two to develop for. As a
result, people often couldn't read files created by colleagues or
friends. As Windows gained market share, more applications were
written for it, which, in a classic chicken-and-egg situation,
helped it gain yet more market share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, of course, likes this argument _ it suggests that its
monopoly evolved naturally as a result of consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   From a software developer's view, too, the lack of a single
operating system made developing new products more expensive and
time consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Now we may begin reliving those days.

   If government regulators take a lesson from the Linux community,
economic and social pressures, and possibly licensing requirements,
could help prevent Windows splitting the operating system into too
many and too varied versions or ``forks.''

<P>
   Socially, ``anyone who forks gets really punished, because the
culture frowns on it'' as unfair, said Tim Bird, the chief
technology officer for embedded-Linux vendor Lineo. In terms of
economics, it doesn't make sense, Bird said.

   A new electric-bicycle company in the Lake District of England
could be the solution for visitors who would like to explore the
countryside by bike but aren't fit enough to tackle the hilly
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Easyriders, offers bicycles with small electric
motors and sensors that monitor the speed and pedal force provided
by the rider and calculate when to supply extra power, thus taking
the effort out of uphill cycling, long distances and head winds.
Depending on road conditions and other factors like weather, the
range of these electric bikes, powered by small nickel metal
hydrogen batteries, is over 25 miles. If the battery runs out, the
bicycle reverts to pedal power only.
</P>
<P>
   Bikes can be rented at the Coniston Boating Center, Lake Road,
Coniston, (44-15394) 41366, or at Waterhead, Windermere Lake,
(44-1539) 431245, for $28 a day or $20 a half day. The price
includes helmets, locks and route maps. Child seats are available
and renters must be at least 14 years old. On the Web:
easy-riders.co.uk.

   Edward Weston and Modernism in Boston
</P>
<P>
   Edward Weston's images _ the elegant seashell, the voluptuous
pepper, nudes melding into the landscape, landscapes sinuous as
nudes _ are so familiar that it is easy to forget his pioneering
role in American modern art. ``Edward Weston: Photography and
Modernism,'' on view at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, through
May 29, presents 140 of his vintage prints alongside nearly 60
works by modernist masters, including Georgia O'Keeffe, Diego
Rivera, Brancusi and Picasso as well as the photographers Alfred
Stieglitz and Imogen Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Through photographs drawn from the Lane Collection, on long-term
loan to the museum, the exhibition traces the purity of form,
fascination with patterns and interest in mundane objects that
marked Weston's work throughout his 30-year career. It illuminates
his contribution to the art movements of his time, from Cubism to
Surrealism.
</P>
<P>
   Some pairings are obvious: an abstract nude from his
breakthrough years in Mexico beside a Rivera drawing, a clean-lined
Brancusi sculpture near those sexy vegetables. Others are more
surprising: a painting by Jackson Pollock above three photographs
of objects in nature that anticipate Abstract Expressionism. The
artistic ferment of the era is captured in small-format portraits
of friends and contemporaries. Igor Stravinsky stares into the
camera; E.E. Cummings looks away; nobody smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's darkroom from Carmel, Calif., has been reconstructed
with the help of his son Cole, and a timeline provides context: in
1926, for example, Weston returned from Mexico, Monet died and the
pop-up toaster was invented.
</P>
<P>
   Hours are Monday and Tuesday, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; Wednesday
through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; and weekends, 10 a.m. to 5:30

17 $5 during school hours and free other times. Call (617)

   Athens Expands Metro, Unearthing Antiquities
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of its role as host of the 2004 Olympics, Athens
is expanding its metro system. The $2.5 billion project includes
two new lines, adding more than 12 miles and 21 stations. Expanded
service began in January with the opening of 13 new stations. The
fare is now 70 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership is expected to increase to 780,000 passengers each day
from 330,000. Ramps, escalators and elevators have been installed
to help passengers with disabilities, and 168 cars have been added
to the system.
</P>
<P>
   Line 1, the green line, has run from Piraeus to Kifissia, a
northern suburb, since 1957. Stations on this line are being
refurbished and made wheelchair-accessible. Line 2, the red line,
will connect the southwestern suburb of Dafni with the northeastern
reaches of the city; it currently runs between Syntagma and
Sepolia. Line 3, the blue line, runs east to west, connecting
Syntagma to Ethniki Amyna. Stations at Omonia, Syntagma,
Monastiraki and Attiki serve as transfer points between lines.
</P>
<P>
   Five additional stations on the red line are expected to be
ready at the end of October. Plans include extending the blue line
to the new international airport in Spata in time for the Olympic
Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the new stations lie within the borders of ancient
Athens. Initial excavations uncovered remains dating as far back as
12,000 years ago, including bathhouses, aqueducts, a sarcophagus
and a room filled with oil lamps. Tunneling rather than surface
excavation was used at stations near archaeological sites.
Photographs and replicas of some interesting finds will decorate
stations in the area of the excavations.

   Luxury Riverboat to Ply Lochs and Highlands
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish Highlands will become more accessible when the
refurbished 50-passenger 150-foot riverboat Lord of the Glens goes
into service between Inverness on the east and Oban on the west of
Scotland in September. Short enough to negotiate the locks of the
60-mile Caledonian Canal, the vessel will be the first luxury
passenger boat to carry overnight passengers the 200 or so miles of
what is called the Great Glen, including crossing Loch Ness.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel has been outfitted with mahogany paneling and brass
fittings and has a dining room with picture windows, a topside
lounge with panoramic view, a library and a gift shop. Cabins
feature twin beds, a desk, color TV and bathrobes.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-night package, including seven nights aboard the boat, two
nights at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh and a night at the
Cameron House Hotel on Loch Lomond, is offered by Thomas P. Gohagan
&AMP; Co. of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   After touring Edinburgh Castle and Holyrood House in Edinburgh,
passengers cross the Highlands by bus to Inverness to board the
Lord of the Glens. During the cruise, they will stop at the
Culloden Battlefield and Cawdor Castle and at Fort Augustus, from
which they will travel by bus and ferry to the Isle of Skye.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $4,595, plus $125 tax, to $6,195, plus tax,
depending on hotel accommodations and departure date, and include
round-trip air fare from New York. Information: (800) 922-3088.

   `Silent Service' Marks its Centennial
</P>
<P>
   For much of its history, the Navy's fleet of submarines has been
known as ``the silent service.'' During the Cold War especially,
when American submarines lurked beneath the world's oceans in
pursuit of Soviet warships and secrets, the fleet's operations _
its disasters and successes _ were known only to a few.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the fleet celebrates its 100th anniversary, the Navy has
lifted the cloak of secrecy a bit. As part of its ``Submarine
Centennial,'' the Navy is sponsoring a yearlong series of
ceremonies, open houses and exhibitions around the country to honor
the fleet _ and not incidentally, in a time of declining defense
budgets, to make a case for its future.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece is an exhibition at the National Museum of
American History in Washington. Called ``Fast Attacks and Boomers:
Submarines in the Cold War,'' the exhibition examines the history
and lore of the submarine fleet from 1945 to 1991 _ a time of
superpower tensions, intrigue and occasional derring-do.
</P>
<P>
   On display are objects from five submarines, including four
fast-attack submarines, whose mission was to locate and track the
enemy, and one boomer, the larger class of submarines that carry
nuclear ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has declassified some artifacts especially for the
exhibition, like control panels and a model of a propeller from the
1960s-era Sturgeon class of submarines. Some of the displays will
try to recreate the extraordinarily claustrophobic quarters of even
the largest submarines.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition opens with a private ceremony on Tuesday, 100
years to the day that the Navy established its submarine force with
the purchase of a gasoline-powered submarine built by John P.
Holland. It opens to the public a day later and will run through
April 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution, is on the Mall
at 14th Street and Constitution Avenue. Admission is free.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is also sponsoring smaller exhibitions at submarine
museums across the nation _ from the Growler, which is docked at
the Intrepid Sea Air and Space Museum in New York, to the Maritime
Museum in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In June there will be an international flotilla of submarines
visiting Norfolk, Va., followed by another in Pearl Harbor the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has posted a full list of events at www.navy.mil.

&HT;     LAWSUIT SAYS CAMPAIGN DONATIONS TO JUDGES ARE
UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUSSELL GOLD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A group of lawyers and consumer advocates filed
a federal lawsuit here Monday claiming Texas' system of electing
judges _ viewed by some as the most notorious in the nation _ is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of lawyers and parties with cases pending before
the court making political donations to sitting judges, while legal
under state law, violates the constitutional guarantee of a fair
trial, lawyers bringing the case said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because judges must raise money both to obtain their seats and
hold onto them, no judge can break free of the appearance of being
beholden to the contributors,'' said Tom ``Smitty'' Smith, head of
the state chapter of the Public Citizen interest group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Supreme Court rulings have prohibited even the appearance
of a bias. Smith and the other plaintiffs have asked the court to
stop all judicial elections starting in 2001, a move that would
force Texas lawmakers to devise a new method of choosing judges.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Browne, a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general,
said she had no comment until the office had a chance to review the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Thomas Phillips of the Texas Supreme Court issued
a statement that read: ``It's a bad system that impairs public
confidence in the courts. But in a democratic society, repair of it
should be by the Legislature and the people and not by federal
court order.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three elections, Supreme Court justices raised a
combined $11 million, according to Cristen Feldman, staff attorney
for Texas for Public Justice, a judicial watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   These donations have worn away the public's and the legal
community's confidence, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 survey by the State Bar of Texas and Texas Supreme
Court, only 1 percent of Texas attorneys said they believed
campaign contributions had no influence on judicial decisions,
while 79 percent said donations had either a very significant or
fairly significant influence.
</P>
<P>
   That contributions are legal is somewhat preposterous, Smith
said, especially considering the restrictions placed on attorney
contact with jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a grounds for mistrial if a attorney were to hand
a cup of coffee or a tissue to a juror, but, ironically, it is not
for a judge to receive a significant campaign contributions from
one of the parties to the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State law limits the size of contributions to Supreme Court
justices, lower appellate and trial judges in large counties.
Individuals can give no more than $5,000 and law firms no more than
$30,000, and political action committees are capped at $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are 14 states that elect either local, appellate or
supreme court judges, said Allison Zieve, a Public Citizen attorney
in Washington, who will be a co-counsel on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rightly or wrongly, Texas has become the poster child for this
sort of system of financing elections,'' she said. ``For various
reasons, Texas has become the most notorious.''

CHOCOLATE CRAVING LANDS THIEF 16-YEAR SENTENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Tyler, Texas, thief, whose first crime was stealing Oreo
cookies as a teen-ager, has been sentenced to 16 years in prison
for stealing a Snickers candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Dude Payne III's tough sentence for a chocolate craving
that normally would have meant a shoplifting charge is the result
of a life of crime, albeit mostly nonviolent crimes, prosecutors
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's kind of goofy when people look at it,'' said Smith
County prosecutor Jodi Brown. ``It wasn't about stealing a Snickers
bar, it was about a lifestyle essentially. ... It was a lifestyle
that he chose and has been choosing since he was 16 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentence for the December theft at a Tyler mom-and-pop store
was handed down last month under the state's habitual offender law.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest, Payne also possessed a bag with less
than 2 ounces of marijuana, a charge that got him a 180-day jail
sentence after he pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Payne had no money when he was arrested, and Brown said he told
police he took the candy bar because he ``knew if (he) went up to
the owner and asked him to give it to (him), he'd say no.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he went to trial last month, Brown asked the jurors to
sentence Payne as a habitual criminal for a minimum of 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old man's criminal history dates to 1987 when he was
16 and was first arrested for stealing the cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Then he moved up to tools, another misdemeanor crime that earned
him jail time, and a misdemeanor assault, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he also did state prison time, earning a four-year
sentence for felony criminal mischief shortly after the cookie
theft, another four-year stint for a 1988 credit-card theft and a
10-year sentence for a 1993 credit-card theft. He was released on
mandatory supervision, a type of parole, in December 1998 after
serving about 4 1/2 years on the 10-year sentence, said prisons
spokesman Glen Castlebury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pain in the butt to have in your neighborhood, but he's
not dangerous,'' Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she had been concerned the jury might feel sorry for
Payne and buy his attorney's argument that it was only a candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's lawyer, Linda Altier of Tyler, did not immediately
return a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he needed to be taught a lesson,'' Brown said. ``I
think that the community needs to see that regardless of what you
go in and steal, if you engage in that type of lifestyle then
that's what you're risking.''
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury said Payne will not be eligible for parole for at
least four years.

JOHN HENNESSY, COMPUTER ARCHITECT, NAMED PRESIDENT OF STANFORD
UNIVERSITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Underscoring Stanford University's deep
relationship with Silicon Valley, John Hennessy, the provost and a
professor of electrical engineering and computer science who
founded a semiconductor company, was named president of the
institution on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A well-known computer architect who has taught at Stanford for
22 years, Hennessy, who is 47, was appointed provost last July.
</P>
<P>
   Within months he had secured a $150 million donation to the
university, the largest since its founding, from James H. Clark, a
former colleague in the computer science department who went on to
found the Netscape Communications Corp. The money is being used to
develop Hennessy's pet project, an interdisciplinary program in
biomedical engineering and sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy, who founded MIPS Technologies, a semiconductor
company, also co-wrote with David Patterson, a professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, a seminal textbook on
designing computers, Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach
(Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, 1990).
</P>
<P>
   Despite Stanford's connections to the very start of Silicon
Valley _ when former Stanford students William Hewlett and David
Packard began an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto _
Hennessy is the university's first president with an engineering
background.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming provost, he was the popular dean of the school
of engineering, where he developed the school's first online degree
program _ a master's in electrical engineering _ and increasingly
offered online classes. His appointment as president was expected;
Stanford has a long history of appointing leaders from within.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy will succeed Gerhard Caspar, a constitutional law
scholar who announced his retirement in September after eight years
leading the university. Caspar, who said he plans to take a
sabbatical then return to teaching, transformed Stanford into one
of the most effective fund-raising universities in the world,
stabilizing a university that had been accused of bilking the
federal government for research. Caspar directed Stanford's most
comprehensive cost-cutting efforts in 30 years, remade the
undergraduate curriculum and oversaw a $1 billion construction,
preservation and restoration program.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday afternoon, an ebullient Hennessy said he
planned to continue to ``build on the foundation'' that Caspar
created.
</P>
<P>
   One issue Hennessy faces as a Silicon Valley president is
assuaging concerns that Stanford is becoming a ``techie'' paradise
at the expense of its humanities and social science departments. An
editorial in Monday's Stanford Daily urged him to make a special
commitment to the humanities.
</P>
<P>
   Hennessy said that he intends to devote attention to the fields,
including using his connections in Silicon Valley to help the
humanities and social science departments secure more support for
their programs. ``I think there are a lot of entrepreneurs who come
from these backgrounds and appreciate their importance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge, Hennessy said, is keeping and recruiting
faculty to the most expensive housing market in the country. The
university must also keep students from being seduced by the
high-paying lures of Silicon Valley companies before earning their
degrees, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   The university is finishing a housing study he commissioned as
provost, he said, to address ways to develop housing that faculty
could afford. As for retaining staff and students, he said: ``We're
in the heat of the gold rush. After a little while it will calm
down a little bit. There will still be a lot of students interested
in entrepreneurship and the new economy. But they'll want to get
their graduate studies done first. I fully believe that.''

   Biking in Wales
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm planning a biking trip to Wales and would like some
information on the route between Cardiff and Holyhead, as well as
suggestions on camping. _ MarySue Wyndom, Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A. The 288-mile stretch of the Welsh National Cycle Route
between Cardiff in South Wales and Holyhead in North Wales is part
of a 9,000-mile network of bicycle and hiking routes being
constructed across Britain. The entire trail system is scheduled to
be completed by 2005; the section between Cardiff and Holyhead was
finished in the late '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the route follows unused railway tracks, quiet backroads
and trails. It also goes through the centers of historic towns and
cities like Cardiff and Hay-on-Wye, and past historic sites like
the 13th century Caernarfon Castle, overlooking the Menai Strait.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the terrain is gentle, there are also more
challenging sections like those that run through Brecon Beacons
National Park, the Cambrian Mountains, Snowdonia National Park and
along Wales' rugged coastline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sustrans, the civil engineering company that is building the
trail system, can provide you with maps and a brochure for $9.50,
plus $6.35 postage (at a rate of 63 pence to the dollar). They can
be ordered by calling (44-117) 929-0888, or through the Web,
www.sustrans.org.uk. You can also request another free booklet,
published by the Wales Tourist Board but available from Sustrans,
called ``Cycling Wales.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the camping sites along the Cardiff-to-Holyhead route are
the following:
</P>
<P>
   In North Wales, Bryn Cynan Fawr Farm, Caernarfon, is a small
family campground on a 40-acre farm on the A499 road. It is open
from June 30 to Sept. 30. Sites range from $8 to $16. Information:
(44-1286) 830320.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In central Wales, Ynysymaengwyn Camp Site, The Lodge,
Ynysymaengwyn, Tywyn, is set on the wooded grounds of an old manor
house on the A493 between Tywyn and Dolgellau. It is open April 1
to Oct. 31. The sites are $9.50 for two people. Information:
(44-1654) 710684.
</P>
<P>
   In South Wales, there is Brynich Caravan Park at Brecon on the
A470 near the A40 junction. It has 60 sites, costing $13.50 to $15
a night. Information: (44-1874) 623325.
</P>
<P>
   New Baltic Ferry
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you know anything about a new fast ferry between Helsinki
and Tallinn? _ Jonathan P. Duvale, Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   A. Silja Line, a Finnish shipping company, is introducing ferry
service between Helsinki and Tallinn, the capital of Estonia,
cutting the crossing time in half. Starting April 17, the
Italian-made SuperSeaCat IV, traveling at about 42 miles an hour,
will make three round trips daily. The one-way crossing will take
an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   The 328-foot monohull ferry is equipped with a T-foil, an
under-water wing that works as a stabilizer. It seats 752
passengers on 2 decks, and can carry 164 cars and 4 buses.
Facilities include a bar and cafeteria, a duty-free shop and
observation area overlooking the bridge.
</P>
<P>

   Avignon for Children
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I, along with our two boys, ages 5 and 7, will
be spending two weeks this summer near Avignon, France. Do you know
of any activities or attractions that might be suitable for our
children? _ Lynne Clarence, Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. You're not going to find any big theme parks in the vicinity
(something that may come as a relief), but your children are likely
to have a grand time exploring the lovely town of Avignon and the
surrounding Provencal countryside.
</P>
<P>
   In Avignon itself, there is the Papal Palace, on the Place du
Palais des Papes, the seat of Christianity and home to nine popes
in the 14th century. The sprawling Gothic structure, with its 10
crenelated towers and massive walls, was built as a citadel during
an age of strife, and bears more resemblance to a fortress than a
religious structure. Built atop the Rocher des Doms, it soars above
the city and is certain to capture any child's imagination. At 6.9
francs to the dollar, admission is $6.50, $5.20 for children 7 and
over. Information: (33-4) 90.27.50.74.
</P>
<P>
   Avignon's white-and-gold tourist train leaves from the square in
front of the Papal Palace. A half-hour ride through the city costs
$5; a 15-minute trip up to the gardens surrounding the Rocher des
Doms costs $1.45. Information: (33-4) 90.82.64.44.
</P>
<P>
   While exhaustive museum visits may not be suitable for small
children, the permanent collection at the Natural History Museum,
67, rue Joseph Vernet in Avignon, with displays on local geology
and fauna, may hold more immediate appeal. Admission is free.
Information (33-4) 90.82.43.51.
</P>
<P>
   Grands Bateaux de Provence offers boat trips along the Rhone.
The excursions range from short jaunts around Avignon to lunch and
dinner cruises and daylong excursions to Arles. Prices are from $6
to $40 a person. Information: (33-4) 90.85.62.25.
</P>
<P>
   Biking is a popular activity during the summer months. Although
the countryside is quite hilly to the north of Avignon, the city is
surrounded by gentle terrain, and there are plenty of small local
roads that see little traffic. Bicycle rentals for adults and
children are available at the Cycles Peugeot Aymard shop, 80, rue
Guillaume Puy, in Avignon. Day rates are $8.75 during the week,
$12.50 on weekends. Information: (33-4) 50.86.32.49.
</P>
<P>
   Near the town of Roquemaure, about seven miles north of Avignon,
there is a small amusement park with rides and games, called
Amazonia. It is open on weekends from late March through October.
The admission fee is $10. For information, call (33-4)
66.82.53.92. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're there in July, you may want to check out Avignon's
international theater festival, which includes outdoor performances
near the Papal Palace. For a schedule and general information,
contact the Avignon Tourist Office, 41, cours Jean Jaures,
telephone (33-4) 32.74.32.74.

COMMENTARY: HURRICANE HUGO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct coding)  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ One of the newest government office
buildings in Caracas is the marbled-sided Ministry of Finance.
Walking through the lobby there the other day I noticed that the
huge clock overlooking the reception desk was either (a) broken or
(b) 20 minutes slow. I didn't stay long enough to see which. But I
did stay in Venezuela long enough to realize that many people were
asking the same thing about President Hugo Chavez's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Is it broken? Or is it just a little late in blooming? Is he
leading Venezuela in a transition, the exact direction of which
will emerge after the May 28 presidential elections, or is he
leading Venezuela into a dead end?
</P>
<P>
   Who is Hugo Chavez? You hear that a lot here, and not just from
the corrupt politicians who ruled Venezuela for four decades before
the populist Chavez ousted them in a vote last year that amounted
to an electoral revolution. With unemployment here at 20 percent,
and with the economy having shrunk by 7.2 percent last year, even
some of the poor have turned against Chavez with graffiti: ``He
feeds us rhetoric to fill our minds, but our stomachs are empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best description of Chavez was from a diplomat here
who said: ``Hugo Chavez is a work in progress _ and a piece of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hugo Chavez who is a piece of work is the Chavez who ordered
U.S. military ships steaming to Venezuela _ on an emergency aid
mission to rebuild the vital coastal highway destroyed by mudslides
_ to go away. Chavez, a former army colonel and pal of Fidel
Castro, didn't want to look too dependent on the U.S. He recently
described Castro's medical-welfare system as a ``sea of happiness''
_ ignoring how many Cubans were risking their lives to swim away
from that sea.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hugo Chavez who is a work in progress is equally
interesting. Venezuela's political system needed a radical
overhaul, and Chavez is doing that. But so far his biggest reform
has been to rewrite the Constitution to widen his powers and
lengthen his potential time in office.
</P>
<P>
   If Chavez is re-elected in May _ he is being challenged by
Francisco Arias Cardenas, a former comrade who has charged Chavez
with incompetence _ the big question is, what will he build on his
new foundation, and with whom? Frankly, his team has a certain
Keystone Kops, not-ready-for-prime-time quality to it.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is obvious. Venezuela is a country that has been
cursed with oil. The reigning assumption in this nation, which sits
atop some of the world's richest fields, has been that Venezuela is
naturally rich and if it is getting poorer it is because someone in
power is stealing. So politics has tended to be about whom to
lynch, not what to build. The truth is, though, that with 85
percent of its foreign currency coming from oil sales, Venezuela is
a country that has forgotten how to create wealth. It only knows
how to distribute it. First the oligarchs distributed it to their
cronies. Now Chavez wants to give more to the underclass.
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't enough oil money anymore, and Chavez has not
detailed any credible plan for creating new wealth _ by attracting
non-energy-related foreign investment and building globally
competitive companies _ so that one-fifth of the country doesn't
have to work for the government. Today, the biggest export of
Venezuela's private sector is itself; the managers and scientists
who have global skills are leaving, frightened by the rising crime
wave and the Chavez populism that suggests that anyone here who has
money must have stolen it.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Chavez ran for office as Robin Hood in a country that needs
Bill Gates _ someone who not only redistributes wealth but knows
how to create it. Chavez came into office with a deep suspicion of
globalization. But on his recent trip to Beijing it was the Chinese
who told him to pay more attention to developing a globally
competitive private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez deserves a chance to prove himself as something more than
Robin Hood. If he can use his credibility with Venezuela's
underclass to lead them to a more modern economy, he will become
one of the most important figures in Latin America. If he doesn't,
Venezuela, which is America's largest supplier of oil, is going to
witness some really explosive and destabilizing politics.
</P>
<P>
   Time is short, and, somewhere at least, a clock is ticking.

 &HT;    Macho attitudes still keep them away, but wives, buddies can
raise awareness
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Union City, Ga., a fire station became the starting
point for good health.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Eberhart, 27, a utility meter reader, wanted to fit
regular exercise into his life. A member of the city's health and
wellness committee, he discovered that Fire Station No. 1 had an
exercise room.
</P>
<P>
   He and a friend started lifting weights there during lunch hour
three times a week. Slowly, they started seeing results _ and so
did about a dozen of Eberhart's co-workers. Now, a pack of guys
lift weights on their lunch hour at the city's three workout
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Public health experts could have predicted that. They've learned
that many men might think of themselves as lone, rugged cowboys _
but when it comes to their health habits, men do better if they
have buddies, bosses, wives or girlfriends encouraging them to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Left alone, too many American men ignore their health and often
shrug off dangerous warning signs. They don't get regular medical
checkups, visiting a doctor only when in pain. And although younger
generations are getting better, old attitudes persist, and those
attitudes have to change, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still part of the macho culture: Be tough, don't cry and
take it like a man,'' said Dr. Kenneth Goldberg, a urologist and
author who trained at Emory University and now runs the Male Health
Center in Dallas, Texas. ``And it ends up killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is serious enough that the Georgia Legislature has
approved the creation of a new commission to address the ``silent
health crisis affecting the health and well-being of Georgia's
men.'' Once the 11-member panel is appointed, it will work to
develop strategies and outreach programs to motivate men to take
better care of themselves, aiming to lower their rates of heart
disease, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, depression and suicide.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study found that one-third of men did not have a
regular physician and more than half had not had a physical exam or
a blood cholesterol test in the past year. And more than 40 percent
said they would delay seeing a doctor at least a week, or ``as long
as possible,'' if they were sick or in pain, according to the
study, headed by the New Commonwealth Fund, a private, nonpartisan
New York foundation that supports independent health research.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, who suffered chest pains over
the weekend and was rushed to a hospital, is a high-profile
example. Despite a family history of high blood pressure, Daley,
57, hadn't had a complete physical in at least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But if health care is easily accessible and social, men tend to
take far better care of themselves. Screenings held at the work
site, for example, do extremely well with men, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the resources to them is a good strategy,'' said Andrew
Walker, health and wellness coordinator for the Georgia Municipal
Association, which has helped 13 cities develop comprehensive
health care programs for their employees.
</P>
<P>
   That's because many men aren't willing to leave work to see a
doctor. But if the doctor comes to their work, they are more
willing to participate. And, surprisingly, such routine screenings
often uncover critical illness, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had several cases where a man would have such severe
hypertension, their boss would immediately take him to a clinic,''
Walker said. He said he has never seen a case where a woman was
found through a screening to be so ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has also proven, in some cases, to be a valuable
tool for men's health care. Using a computer, they can seek out
answers to questions they might be unwilling to discuss with
anyone. With a point and click, they can learn about such sensitive
subjects as prostate cancer, vasectomies, obesity and impotence.
</P>
<P>
   As the Net gets more sophisticated, sites are getting better at
reaching their target audiences. On Goldberg's site
(www.malehealthcenter.com), he compares men's health to car
maintenance:
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys understand cars. They know that to get 100,000 miles on
the odometer, you have to take really good care of the internal
components: the engine, the drivetrain, the wheels. And to keep
that car looking good at 100,000 miles, you need to take good care
of the sheet metal and paint. ... Just like your car, your body
requires a fair amount of preventive maintenance to keep it running
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Internet has its own unique problems. Men can be
``incredibly gullible for the magic fix,'' Goldberg said. Many
don't have as much experience with the health care system as women,
and they ``literally come in here with paper sacks filled with
(Internet) articles about superpotency anti-aging formulas and
cancer cures.''
</P>
<P>
   When men turn off their computers, they still don't like to face
the health care system alone. Buddy systems work well for many men,
who seem to thrive on the implicit or not so implicit challenges
set by their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have found is men setting examples for other men works
really well,'' said Glenda Norton, Union City's health and wellness
coordinator. Healthful habits have caught on so much among the
city's 110 employees that it has opened three exercise facilities
within the past three years, she said. Union City also offers
smoking cessation contests, with any employee who stops smoking for
one year receiving a $100 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the city's workers _ mostly men _ loved the body fat
calculator at a health fair, Norton said. ``They were all comparing
their numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, those who have survived prostate cancer
have found that when they share their experiences, more men are
willing to be tested for the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer, I didn't know
anything,'' said Tom McCleary, 68, of Cobb County. ``I didn't know
where the prostate was, what its function was, and I certainly had
never talked to another man about it. And I was a fairly educated
guy, who always had a primary care physician and was somewhat
health conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   But within the past five years, older men are breaking down the
barriers, said McCleary, a member of the Georgia Prostate Cancer
Coalition. ``Now, Optimist Clubs and Lions' Clubs are talking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wives also can play active roles in helping men change
behaviors. For better or worse, women are the sole cooks in many
American households _ which contributes to a man's nutritional
health _ and they are often the health care coordinators.
Particularly among older couples, if an appointment needs to be
made, it's often the wife who calls the doctor and nags her husband
to go.
</P>
<P>
   And there are more subtle ways wives keep their men on track.
Public health workers talk about the wives who notice the black
moles on their husbands' backs, the limp in their walk or a change
in weight.
</P>
<P>
   But health workers want to see more men take responsibility for
their own health. And there's evidence that younger men don't have
the same inhibitions that past generations have had about seeking
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a son ... I would tell him to go to the doctor and
get checked out,'' Eberhart said. ``I would tell him we're allowed
to be human.''
</P>

 &HT;    JUDGE FINDS MICROSOFT BROKE ANTITRUST LAW
 &HT;    950&AMP;add. With MICROSOFT-BUSINESS, MICROSOFT-COST,
MICROSOFT-REMEDIES, MICROSOFT-HIGHLIGHTS and MICROSOFT-JUDGE.
Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. broke the nation's antitrust laws
by placing ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive
fortune'' to target rival firms that threatened its software
monopoly, a federal judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By finding that Microsoft has used illegal means to dominate one
most dynamic sectors of the U.S. economy, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson opened a new stage of the trial that would
set ``remedies'' _ including possibly the breakup of the world's
most valued software company.
</P>
<P>
   Although a negotiated settlement is still possible, Microsoft
pledged to appeal the ruling, potentially prolonging the legal
struggle for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The historic ruling flowed from Jackson's blistering ``findings
of fact,'' issued last November, in which he branded Microsoft as a
predatory monopolist that for years had run roughshod over
competitors, strong-armed clients, harmed consumers and throttled
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In equally scathing terms, Jackson's ``conclusions of law''
Monday spelled out how Microsoft had violated both sections of the
110-year-old Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft mounted a deliberate assault upon entrepreneurial
efforts that, left to rise or fall on their own merits, could well
have enabled the introduction of competition into the market for
Intel-compatible PC operating systems,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the evidence does not prove that they would have
succeeded absent Microsoft's actions, it does reveal that Microsoft
placed an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,
thereby effectively guaranteeing its continued dominance in the
relevant market.
</P>
<P>
   ``More broadly, Microsoft's anticompetitive actions trammeled
the competitive process through which the computer software
industry generally stimulates innovation and conduces to the
optimum benefit of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 43-page ruling, Jackson concurred with three of the
government's four key contentions over how Microsoft had violated
the law.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that the company had unlawfully maintained its Windows
operating system monopoly, unlawfully tied its Internet Explorer
Web browser to the operating system and entered into numerous
unlawful exclusionary agreements to the detriment of its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not find Microsoft guilty of seeking to monopolize
the Internet browser market at the expense of Navigator, the rival
product of Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court concludes that Microsoft's multiple agreements with
distributors did not ultimately deprive Netscape of the ability to
have access to every PC user worldwide to offer an opportunity to
install Navigator,'' Jackson found.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Jackson's long-awaited decision, lawyers for
both sides will gather again in the judge's chambers, probably
Tuesday, to map the schedule for the next stage of what is by now
nearly a two-year-long legal process.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage of this process, the litigants could decide to try
once more to settle the case, this time likely through direct
negotiations. Barring such a settlement, the U.S. Supreme Court
might be forced to rule in what is likely to be its most important
antitrust decision since the breakup of the Standard Oil trust in
1911.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and some state attorneys general
raised the prospect that they make seek to impose interim sanctions
against the software giant while the appeals process moves forward.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, at a press conference on Microsoft's Redmond, Wash.,
campus, chairman Bill Gates said the company may seek an expedited
appeal, perhaps ahead of Jackson's remedy rulings in the wake of
Monday's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gates on a day in which his personal fortune fell by some
$11.5 billion as Microsoft stock tumbled by 15.5 per cent: ``While
we will continue to look for new opportunities to resolve it, we
believe we have a strong case on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   A half hour earlier on the other end of the continent, Attorney
General Janet Reno said: ``We are pleased that the court agreed
with the department that Microsoft abused its monopoly power, that
it violated the antitrust laws, and that it harmed consumers.
Microsoft has been held accountable for its illegal conduct by a
court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's antitrust chief, Joel Klein, who has personally steered
the case through the courts, said: ``This landmark opinion ... will
also set the ground rules for enforcement in the Information Age.
It demonstrates once again that no company, no matter how powerful
or how successful, can refuse to play by the rules, and thwart
competition for America's consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's verdict came two days after extensive efforts to reach
an out-of-court settlement collapsed. Hoping the litigants could
strike a deal, Jackson had delayed issuing his ruling while Richard
Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago, sought in vain to hammer out an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the aborted negotiations as ``very complex,'' Iowa
Attorney General Thomas Miller, a frequent courtroom visitor, said
many factors led to the breakdown, but ``the position of the states
was not the cause of the failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, immediately available on the Internet, was issued
an hour after the major financial markets closed in a session that
saw Microsoft stock battered. At close of trading, it had lost 14.5
percent of its value on the day, or $15.37 a share, to fall to
$91.88 on volume of 125 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat toppled Microsoft from the top, leaving it as the
world's third most valued company, at $474 billion, behind General
Electric and Cisco Systems and contributing to the largest biggest
one day loss ever on the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling serves as an important milestone in a historic
action brought nearly two years ago by the Justice Department at 19
state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing 76 days of testimony from the bench and reviewing
scores of post-trial briefs, Jackson essentially upheld the
government's original contention that Microsoft had illegally
leveraged its Windows monopoly to to try to crush its rivals and
bully its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's verdict enhances the standing of some 115 class-action
lawsuits that have already been filed by on behalf of Microsoft
customers and potentially opens to the door to many more. The
guilty verdict hands plaintiffs valuable legal ammunition to pursue
these civil suits over Windows pricing and related issues. If
successful, they could result in the award of triple damages.

   But William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said, ``it's

may be put on hold while Microsoft pursues its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's settlement proposal, rejected out of
hand by Microsoft last week, could still be revived by Jackson in
the remedial phase of the trial, which is likely to yield one more
courtroom drama to hear oral arguments.

   In its proposed consent decree, the government called for strict
and enforceable rules on what products could be bundled with
Microsoft's flagship Windows software. Other demands were aimed at
preventing Microsoft from retaliating against personal computer

<P>
   Microsoft had made three key concessions during negotiations,
which proved insufficient but which nevertheless are likely to be
revived by the company in the next stage of the trial.

   It offered to sell Windows at a standard price to all comers,

<P>
   Microsoft now faces months of uncertainty before the remedies
are imposed and years more in pursuing the appeal process, which is
likely to reach the Supreme Court even as if continues to contest
the swarm of the civil cases.

Microsoft must wage a struggle to preserve its markets even as it
fights a potentially crippling battle in the legal arena. But
unlike tobacco and firearms, which are relatively static
commodities, the software business continues charge constantly,
putting an added burden on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens from here on in the courts, Microsoft can
expect to see a phenomenal flow of income from Windows for some
time to come,'' said William Janeway, a senior managing director of
Warburg Pincus Equity Partners, a venture capital firm with large
investments in the high technology field.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the key problem that Microsoft faces has little to do with
the courtroom,'' Janeway added. ``It is that the industry is
quickly moving into a new space the features Internet servers and
mobile devices. And in this space, Microsoft is just another player
and not such a strong player at that.''

 &HT;    JUDGE FINDS MICROSOFT BROKE ANTITRUST LAW
 &HT;    950&AMP;add. With MICROSOFT-BUSINESS, MICROSOFT-COST,
MICROSOFT-REMEDIES, MICROSOFT-HIGHLIGHTS and MICROSOFT-JUDGE.
Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. broke the nation's antitrust laws
by placing ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive
fortune'' to target rival firms that threatened its software
monopoly, a federal judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By finding that Microsoft has used illegal means to dominate one
most dynamic sectors of the U.S. economy, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson opened a new stage of the trial that would
set ``remedies'' _ including possibly the breakup of the world's
most valued software company.
</P>
<P>
   Although a negotiated settlement is still possible, Microsoft
pledged to appeal the ruling, potentially prolonging the legal
struggle for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The historic ruling flowed from Jackson's blistering ``findings
of fact,'' issued last November, in which he branded Microsoft as a
predatory monopolist that for years had run roughshod over
competitors, strong-armed clients, harmed consumers and throttled
innovation.
</P>
<P>
   In equally scathing terms, Jackson's ``conclusions of law''
Monday spelled out how Microsoft had violated both sections of the
110-year-old Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft mounted a deliberate assault upon entrepreneurial
efforts that, left to rise or fall on their own merits, could well
have enabled the introduction of competition into the market for
Intel-compatible PC operating systems,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the evidence does not prove that they would have
succeeded absent Microsoft's actions, it does reveal that Microsoft
placed an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,
thereby effectively guaranteeing its continued dominance in the
relevant market.
</P>
<P>
   ``More broadly, Microsoft's anticompetitive actions trammeled
the competitive process through which the computer software
industry generally stimulates innovation and conduces to the
optimum benefit of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 43-page ruling, Jackson concurred with three of the
government's four key contentions over how Microsoft had violated
the law.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that the company had unlawfully maintained its Windows
operating system monopoly, unlawfully tied its Internet Explorer
Web browser to the operating system and entered into numerous
unlawful exclusionary agreements to the detriment of its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not find Microsoft guilty of seeking to monopolize
the Internet browser market at the expense of Navigator, the rival
product of Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court concludes that Microsoft's multiple agreements with
distributors did not ultimately deprive Netscape of the ability to
have access to every PC user worldwide to offer an opportunity to
install Navigator,'' Jackson found.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Jackson's long-awaited decision, lawyers for
both sides will gather again in the judge's chambers, probably
Tuesday, to map the schedule for the next stage of what is by now
nearly a two-year-long legal process.
</P>
<P>
   At any stage of this process, the litigants could decide to try
once more to settle the case, this time likely through direct
negotiations. Barring such a settlement, the U.S. Supreme Court
might be forced to rule in what is likely to be its most important
antitrust decision since the breakup of the Standard Oil trust in
1911.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials and some state attorneys general
raised the prospect that they make seek to impose interim sanctions
against the software giant while the appeals process moves forward.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, at a press conference on Microsoft's Redmond, Wash.,
campus, chairman Bill Gates said the company may seek an expedited
appeal, perhaps ahead of Jackson's remedy rulings in the wake of
Monday's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gates on a day in which his personal fortune fell by some
$11.5 billion as Microsoft stock tumbled by 15.5 per cent: ``While
we will continue to look for new opportunities to resolve it, we
believe we have a strong case on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   A half hour earlier on the other end of the continent, Attorney
General Janet Reno said: ``We are pleased that the court agreed
with the department that Microsoft abused its monopoly power, that
it violated the antitrust laws, and that it harmed consumers.
Microsoft has been held accountable for its illegal conduct by a
court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's antitrust chief, Joel Klein, who has personally steered
the case through the courts, said: ``This landmark opinion ... will
also set the ground rules for enforcement in the Information Age.
It demonstrates once again that no company, no matter how powerful
or how successful, can refuse to play by the rules, and thwart
competition for America's consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's verdict came two days after extensive efforts to reach
an out-of-court settlement collapsed. Hoping the litigants could
strike a deal, Jackson had delayed issuing his ruling while Richard
Posner, chief judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago, sought in vain to hammer out an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the aborted negotiations as ``very complex,'' Iowa
Attorney General Thomas Miller, a frequent courtroom visitor, said
many factors led to the breakdown, but ``the position of the states
was not the cause of the failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, immediately available on the Internet, was issued
an hour after the major financial markets closed in a session that
saw Microsoft stock battered. At close of trading, it had lost 14.5
percent of its value on the day, or $15.37 a share, to fall to
$91.88 on volume of 125 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat toppled Microsoft from the top, leaving it as the
world's third most valued company, at $474 billion, behind General
Electric and Cisco Systems and contributing to the largest biggest
one day loss ever on the Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling serves as an important milestone in a historic
action brought nearly two years ago by the Justice Department at 19
state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing 76 days of testimony from the bench and reviewing
scores of post-trial briefs, Jackson essentially upheld the
government's original contention that Microsoft had illegally
leveraged its Windows monopoly to to try to crush its rivals and
bully its clients.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's verdict enhances the standing of some 115 class-action
lawsuits that have already been filed by on behalf of Microsoft
customers and potentially opens to the door to many more. The
guilty verdict hands plaintiffs valuable legal ammunition to pursue
these civil suits over Windows pricing and related issues. If
successful, they could result in the award of triple damages.
</P>
<P>
   But William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said, ``it's
not so clear to us that a judicial decision ... translates into a
decision in these class-action suits.'' He suggested the lawsuits
may be put on hold while Microsoft pursues its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's settlement proposal, rejected out of
hand by Microsoft last week, could still be revived by Jackson in
the remedial phase of the trial, which is likely to yield one more
courtroom drama to hear oral arguments.
</P>
<P>

and enforceable rules on what products could be bundled with
Microsoft's flagship Windows software. Other demands were aimed at

 &HT;    Just call Harvey a child of the '60s
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Atlanta citymag ($3.95) says in its profile of one of
Atlanta's most controversial attorneys, most criminals would kill
to have Bruce Harvey on their side. And most of them have. Writer
Alice Welsh Doyle goes behind the ever-present ponytail to reveal
more about the lawyer who thrives on high-profile, unpopular cases.
(He defended convicted mail bomber Walter Leroy Moody and is
currently representing Teri Lynn Peterson, who is accused of
killing her 5-year-old nephew Terrell Peterson.) Moody says he's
simply a product of the '60s. ``I had the hair and tattoos before I
became a lawyer,'' he says. And the flamboyance Harvey exhibits in
the courtroom is all part of the show, says Gwinnett County
District Attorney Danny Porter. ``All trial lawyers put on shows.
...You have to make the jury believe.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jaws, revisited: Twenty-five years after Peter Benchley chased
everybody out of the water with his novel about a great white
shark, the writer has had a change of heart. ``I couldn't possibly
write `Jaws' today ... not in good conscience anyway,'' he writes
in the April 2000 issue of National Geographic ($3). When he wrote
``Jaws,'' Benchley says, it was accepted as fact that great whites
ate people by choice. ``Now we know that almost every attack on a
human is an accident,'' he says. Benchley and underwater
photographer David Doubilet will provide a close-up view of sharks
Sunday at 8 p.m. on National Geographic's Explorer on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Roberts rules: No, Julia Roberts' picture didn't make the
cover of Rolling Stone ($3), but she has appeared on the front of
nearly every other magazine lately. The actress does get ample
coverage inside with a lengthy conversation with Chris Heath, who
culls questions and answers from Roberts' grueling three days of
press interviews to promote her movie, ``Erin Brockovich.'' After
fielding the usual questions about cleavage and her boyfriend
Benjamin Bratt, Roberts opens up about everything from her
relationship with her late father to how she felt when she was in
school in Georgia. ``I was considered completely common and
average...''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Diamond darlings: GQ ($3) correspondent Peter Richmond
profiles three of baseball's biggest superstars in a cover story on
shortstops Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and Nomar Garciaparra. The
one thing they have in common besides class, Richmond writes, is
``a love of the game the way it was meant to be played, free of
frills.'' And, in ``Duh and Dumber,'' Alex Richman analyzes the
country's obsession with ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and
decries the lowering of our standards from tough questions in an
isolation booth to multiple choices with help lines.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The final frontiers: Time and Newsweek (each $3.50) tackle big
science topics this week. Newsweek's cover story reports on the
Human Genome Project, the race to determine the exact chemical
sequence that constitutes the DNA in every cell of the human body.
The completion of that task, expected in June, promises to
revolutionize medicine and biotechnology. And in the latest of five
special reports on ``Visions for the 21st Century,'' Time ponders
whether humans will ever live on Mars, travel to the stars, meet
alien intelligences, learn how to time-travel, clone dinosaurs and
other fascinating science-fictional questions.

 &HT;    Bush aims to clear environmental record with new proposal; Penn.
governor good VP match, some say
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush swung through tactically
critical Pennsylvania on Monday touting his alliance with its
popular governor and a new environmental initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe Bush may have found an ideal running mate in
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a pro-abortion rights Catholic and
Vietnam veteran who is in a good position to deliver this state's
23 electoral votes in November.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, using a former steel plant as a backdrop, Bush
laid out a plan aimed at bolstering his environmental image, which
critics say is murky at best.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed a six-point plan that would speed up redevelopment
of polluted industrial sites and abandoned factories called
brownfields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosperity will mean little if we leave to future generations
a world of polluted air, toxic lakes and rivers and banished
forests,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal to redevelop abandoned industrial sites while
maintaining greenspace could help blunt criticism of his
environmental stewardship in Texas, where air pollution in Houston
recently surpassed that of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   By addressing an issue that Vice President Al Gore has
championed since 1993, Bush continued his effort to coax support
from the type of Democrat and independent voters who liked former
candidate Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush and Gore in a statistical dead heat and Bush has
said that he intends to fight hard in Pennsylvania, with the
59-year-old Ridge at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pennsylvania is a big, somewhat complex state and (Ridge) is
highly regarded,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the
Annenberg School of Communication at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``He has worked well with the Legislature. He has
been a very successful governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Credentials such as Ridge's could help Bush capture swing votes
while muting questions about Bush's own military experience, which
included a stint in the Texas Air National Guard when many of his
peers, like Ridge, were in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush campaigned in New Jersey and Wisconsin with two
other frequently named possible V.P. contenders _ Gov. Christine
Todd Whitman and Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   States such as Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, both of which hold
primaries today, are critical because Gore and Bush already have
divided the rest of the country. Gore is strong in the Northeast
and in California _ a delegate powerhouse _ and Bush dominates the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania also has rabbit's foot appeal. Since 1960, all but
one presidential contender who has won the state has also seized
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a competitive, two-party state ...,'' said Terry
Madonna, director of the Center for Politics &AMP; Public Affairs at
Millersville University. ``If Gore appears too liberal, then Bush
will win the blue collar, working class Catholics in the mining and
mill towns of southwestern Pennsylvania. If Gore can make Bush
appear right wing, way out on the limb, then (Bush) loses the
suburban voters in the Philadelphia suburbs. The balance hangs on
being the centrist and making the other candidate appear to be out
of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush called on the Environmental Protection Agency to develop
clean-up standards that are more flexible than those under the
Superfund program and to protect developers who meet the new
standards from future federal litigation. Bush also wants to
permanently extend a brownfield clean-up tax incentive set to
expire Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Superfund program, created two decades ago to clean
up polluted industrial sites, has had limited impact. A General
Accounting Office study found that 595 of the nation's 1,231
Superfund sites have been cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign Monday attacked Bush's support for allowing
plants to voluntarily reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of whitewashing can cover up Bush's record,'' Gore
spokesman Doug Hattaway said.

 &HT;    Will `The Phantom Menace' be a Force in video?
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's back _ again. ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' last year's No. 1 box office hit, which amassed $922.6
million in ticket sales worldwide, arrives in video stores today.
But even some of the most die-hard ``Star Wars'' fans are starting
to say the ``Phantom'' party's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little burned out,'' says Carl Cunningham, 28, of
Acworth, an IBM staffer in Marietta and longtime ``Star Wars''
collector. ``When you have a wedding, you plan a party and end up
with a hangover and a headache. This was like a party we had for 16
years _ and the hangover lasts longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Cunningham will still buy a ``Phantom'' video for his
daughter Taylor for her sixth birthday Saturday. ``The cheap
pan-and-scan version. She won't know the difference.'' Plus, he'll
try to snag one of the life-size Yoda figures that Blockbuster will
give away at each of its stores in metro Atlanta at drawings to be
held Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I was heavily into it, there was no way to collect
all the fast-food toys,'' Cunningham says. ``It was like last
mid-August when I started to feel like `Stop, stop bombarding me
with this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham says he saw ``Phantom'' at the theater 16 times. ``It
was the 16th time that I decided I was disappointed in the film
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Some video store managers have a sense that the public would
rather ``see dead people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think `Phantom Menace' is going to be as big as `The
Sixth Sense,''' says Chuck Tintle of Dunwoody Versatile Video.
``The Sixth Sense,'' the Oscar-nominated movie with its own
life-size Yoda _ Haley Joel Osment _ was released on video last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Tintle's store has 48 copies of ``Phantom'' and 66 of ``The
Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   On Internet site reel.com, ``Phantom'' is selling for $16.99 in
standard VHS format and $33.99 for a wide-screen collectors'
edition that includes a behind-the-scenes documentary and
commemorative 35mm film strip. The movie is not yet available on
DVD.

RELAXING LIKE A CELEBRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., April 9)  
(jt) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frankly, I was seduced by the brochure. After all, I had never
been to Parrot Cay, the new Caribbean resort in the Turks and
Caicos Islands, nor did I have friends who had visited. But my
husband, Tim, and I were both exhausted and, this January,
desperately wanted to indulge ourselves with a world-class rest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I worried. Parrot Cay, with 56 rooms and 2 restaurants,
was the only thing on the 1,000-acre island: no shops, no night
life. How much could we read and how much could we swim? If we
didn't like the other guests, how could we avoid them? The price
was high, and the food, the amenities and the service were
unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   So I had an alternative plan: use our itinerary through Miami to
the Turks and Caicos as an escape hatch. I told myself we could
always retreat to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But our spirits lifted enormously when Bandele Neutelings, the
charming wife of the general manager of the resort, picked us up at
the airport on Providenciales, the busiest of the country's roughly
40 islands, for the drive to the harbor and the boat ride to Parrot
Cay. Her enthusiasm for the islands and the hotel was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   And when we stepped off the resort's cabin cruiser onto the
Parrot Cay dock, I immediately scrapped my backup plan. As a golf
cart whisked us up to the main house atop a 55-foot hill _ the
highest in the islands _ we felt ourselves entering a deliciously
exotic South Seas atmosphere. And we stayed enveloped in it until
the day we left. In fact, my phone calls to friends, advising them
to try it as soon as possible, were the biggest additional charges
on our bill, with the possible exception of pina coladas.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure had shown a room with a four-poster bed draped in
white mosquito netting. There was a view through a bedroom door
framed by white curtains wafting onto a balcony that looked out to
a chartreuse, lime and slate-blue sea: the vast, mirror-still
infinity swimming pool seemed to touch the edge of a horizontal
belt of white sand.
</P>
<P>
   There were no guests in the photos, only a housekeeper fluffing
pillows and a smiling waitress bearing drinks. The illusion was
that Parrot Cay would be our own private island paradise. The
reality came close to that illusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the white stucco main house, which is the center of the
hotel's public space, light poured through floor-to-ceiling windows
over the earth-tone tile floors and the low, simple Balinese style
furniture. From the front desk, there was a sweeping view in one
direction out to the thin line of white breakers crossing the coral
reef. Behind was the almost deserted island of North Caicos _
separated from Parrot Cay by just a few hundred yards of quiet
water so shallow you can walk across at low tide.
</P>
<P>
   In the adjoining octagonal room was a large, round bar,
surrounded by deeply upholstered white sofas. A wide flight of
stairs led down to the dining room, where guests could dine either
indoors or on the broad patio.
</P>
<P>
   With only a handful of cars, no jets overhead and few
speedboats, Parrot Cay seemed strangely silent. There were no signs
announcing dinner hours, events or trips. Few guests wandered by.
It was several days before I learned that we were not the only ones
who had been seduced by the vision of Parrot Cay's desolate beaches
and the promise of sailing, snorkeling and being pampered in a spa
offering six types of massages, as well as body wraps and yoga with
a private instructor.
</P>
<P>
   There were celebrities all over the place. They just were rarely
visible. Paul McCartney and his daughter Stella were there, halfway
through a three-week stay. One afternoon, I saw Raquel Welch
lounging on a white chaise by the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Then I caught a honeymooning Jerry Seinfeld and Jessica Sklar
deep in conversation over lunch. The actor Judge Reinhold and Amy
Miller, also on their honeymoon, checked in shortly after we did,
and Liam Neeson, his wife, Natasha Richardson, and Aidan Quinn
arrived toward the end of our stay.
</P>
<P>
   Even Welch, who was on the boat with us when we left, marveled
at the roster of celebrities. ``I have never seen so many in one
place,'' she said. ``They all come for the privacy, and the
beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   For these people, the lure of a private island away from prying
paparazzi surely was a large part of its appeal. Yet while the
hotel may be remote, it offers elegance without formality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I designed it for people who were past the point of needing to
wear two watches and Cartier jewelry by the pool,'' said Keith
Hobbs, the resort's interior designer, in a telephone call from
London after our stay. ``These people want to go back to shorts and
relax, which is why it has attracted a number of superstars. They
don't have to change three times a day.''
</P>
<P>
   My husband put on a blazer just once during our stay, and then
only because the evening was cool.
</P>
<P>
   Parrot Cay was created in 1988 by a wealthy Kuwaiti, who built
the main house and the series of long, white two-story stucco
buildings with barrel tile roofs and Saltillo tile floors. The
buildings tumble down the hillside to the sea and house about 40
guest rooms. But the Gulf War came, the Kuwaiti's finances went,
and the hotel stood empty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a Singapore couple, B.S. and Christina Ong, bought the
island, redid the main hotel and added six bungalows along the
beach, where the celebrities hid out. They opened the resort in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Ongs have kept the 48 guest rooms simple. In eight two-story
buildings, the rooms are spacious, with high peaked ceilings and
gently whirring fans. There are no upholstered armchairs, oversize
armoires or television sets (unless you request one). Indonesian
teak furniture is set on terra-cotta tile floors, and bright white
linens and shuttered windows add a Caribbean flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the simplicity masks an awareness of how to pamper spoiled
guests _ skills learned well by the Ongs, who also own the
Metropolitan and the Halkin hotels in London and four Four Seasons
properties, in Singapore, the Maldives and Bali.

 &HT;    Ruling could trigger new suits vs. company
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling Monday against
Microsoft will strengthen lawsuits now pending against the company
and spawn even more, antitrust lawyers predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling will have a significant impact in terms of
creating a road map of liability against Microsoft in other
cases,'' said Kevin Grady, an antitrust lawyer for the Atlanta firm
Alston &AMP; Bird. ``And, certainly, a strongly worded order will
probably bring a lot of other cases out of the woodwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of lawsuits have already been filed against the company.
These include class-action cases filed by Microsoft's wholesalers
and distributors, suits filed by competitors of the software
company and a number of consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling from Judge Jackson is going to make it a lot easier
because it will be admissible in cases like ours,'' said San
Francisco lawyer Terry Gross. He filed suit against Microsoft on
behalf of consumers and companies, contending they paid too much
for the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers in the California case will try to introduce
Jackson's ruling into evidence under the legal doctrine of
``collateral estoppel.'' This doctrine allows a ruling in another
case _ such as the federal antitrust case in Washington before
Jackson _ to be admitted in a similar case in another jurisdiction.
Because the issue before Jackson already has been litigated by
Microsoft, it should not be contested again, plaintiffs' lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The force of Jackson's ruling in these other cases, however,
will have limited effect until Microsoft's appeals run the gamut.
Only if Jackson's ruling is upheld can it be used persuasively in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the plaintiffs' lawyers are expecting the judge's ruling
will improve their position on liability against Microsoft or on
damages, or both,'' said Atlanta lawyer Martin Chitwood, who
specializes in class-action cases.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has called these types of
class-action cases ``piling on.'' He has predicted his company will
prevail on appeal and contended that Microsoft has charged the
lowest price possible for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But Gross countered that the class-action complaints are being
filed because of the violations exposed in the federal antitrust
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawsuits are not being filed because we're piling on,''
the San Francisco attorney said. ``It's because the federal
antitrust action has turned over the rock under which Microsoft was
hiding evidence of its illegal monopolistic actions.''
</P>
<P>
   California is one of only 17 states that allow state court
antitrust lawsuits by consumers and companies that have not bought
their products directly from the company.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1977 barred federal lawsuits by
so-called indirect purchasers. For example, a consumer who bought
Microsoft software from a retailer cannot sue Microsoft on
antitrust grounds in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, Microsoft's competitors are sure to be poring
over Jackson's findings.
</P>
<P>
   When deciding valid antitrust claims, the courts first determine
the total amount of commerce generated by the company found to have
violated the law. The courts then calculate what percentage of
business it cost the company that suffered the harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If upheld, this ruling could be very valuable to Microsoft's
rivals,'' Atlanta lawyer W. Pitts Carr said. ``In a case like this,
looking at it from a damages standpoint, you're talking about
enormous, enormous numbers, potentially billions and billions of
dollars.''

 UNDATED: and Bali.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each room had not only the requisite terry cloth robes, but also
flip-flops and oversize straw bags that were so attractive we saw
two of them on the plane going home with guests who'd bought them.
The TV we requested (which was free) had 20 channels via satellite
and a built-in VCR for movies from the hotel's ample library _ no
sign outs, no rush returns. Music CD's were similarly abundant and
accessible for the CD players that were also available on request.
</P>
<P>
   Our private, covered second-floor balcony had an ocean view and
was painted a clean white and equipped with a coffeepot, cups, a
refrigerator and full minibar. So when we woke early, we made our
coffee outdoors, curled up on the oversize rattan chaise longue and
watched the sun creeping up over the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Parrot Cay has two tennis courts, lighted for night play. There
are also bicycles, extra tennis rackets, nimble little 16-foot
catamaran sailboats, kayaks, and equipment and experts for scuba
diving and snorkeling. But the lapping waves, the pale blue sky and
white sand beach mostly inspired us and the few other guests we saw
to sit under canvas umbrellas napping, reading or just staring at
the sea. After several days, when I passed the exercise pavilion
and saw people working out, I was mystified at their ability to
expend such energy.
</P>
<P>
   We took an hour here and there to skim along the beach a few
hundred yards offshore on one of the hotel's three little
sailboats. We went snorkeling, too, along the inner edge of the
coral reef line that runs parallel to the the shore nearly a mile
out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   There, in perhaps 20 feet of water, iridescent red, blue, yellow
and green tropical fish meandered cautiously near the dark safety
of coral nooks and caverns, just out of reach of the few solitary
silver barracudas cruising silently by. Nyoman, the Balinese who
took us to the reef, assured us that snorkeling in Bali was even
more beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   But my favorite pastime was walking up and down our milelong
beach (there are two others on the island) and standing there alone
at the end of the day watching the sun go orange and sink into the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   There was no rush to lunch or dinner. The two restaurants _ one
poolside, just back from the beach, and the other in the main house
_ were never crowded. We alternated between always promptly
delivered breakfasts on our balcony and a breakfast buffet on the
main-house terrace with its Florida keystone balustrade.
</P>
<P>
   The chef, Rajah Pillay, who has worked at several Four Seasons
hotels, told us he prided himself on homemade croissants and pain
au chocolat. But the health-minded could choose from a buffet with
cereals, yogurt, fruit juices and omelets.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch was served at the open-air pavilion by the pool, where the
menu included Caesar salad, penne and club sandwiches. Every day,
there was grilled fresh local lobster or other local fish; only the
tuna and salmon were imported.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner alternated between the main house and the open-air dining
room. One evening, as torches illuminated the sky and reggae music
played softly, we feasted on pan-fried crab cakes and roasted
Chinese duck breast.
</P>
<P>
   Though many guests dined in their bungalows, those who stopped
at the bar in an old stone building by the sea often got into
conversation, but evenings ended early. The single night we agreed
to have dinner with another couple, even setting a time to meet
seemed vaguely pressured.
</P>
<P>
   Such languorous and luxurious living came at a high price. The
five-day package, for instance, included an oceanfront room, three
meals, transportation costs between Providenciales and the island,
an excursion and a bottle of champagne, and cost $4,100 for two.
</P>
<P>
   Like most hotels, Parrot Cay has different packages. Generally,
however, with a modified American plan (breakfast and dinner),
nightly rates range from $620 for a garden room to $850 for an
ocean view. Bungalows are more. There was no charge for our
bicycles, tennis or sailing (or for many of the resort's other
activities).
</P>
<P>
   But the competition for indulgences was intense. Booking a
massage that week had to be done early _ I booked two days ahead. I
opted for a no-frills Swedish massage ($100) made especially
wonderful because my masseuse, Kate, who had left her job in London
to work at Parrot Cay, came to our room. But at dinner, a couple
raved about the Balinese massages.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered a secret place on the island, too: the spa. It
consists of two small wood bungalows, one with a number of
treatment rooms and the other a single large room that can be
reserved for private yoga classes. From its own small infinity
pool, there was a view across the narrow strait to North Caicos.
The hotel's architect, Rolf Rothermel, an Englishman who lives on
Providenciales, told me that the stillness of the water and the
rarity of boats on the channel made the view his favorite on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Parrot Cay has its glitches. The hotel has yet to heat the
swimming pool, which can be quite chilly on a breezy day. Some
guests complained of insect bites. Though I had some, they were a
minor annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that if you can fly five hours to a place that feels
like your own South Seas island retreat, then the not
inconsiderable cost is worth every penny. In fact, the only
negative emotion I experienced all week was regret at the thought
of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   From Miami, American Airlines, (800) 433-7300, www.aa.com, flies
jets twice daily to Providenciales. The Parrot Cay resort arranges
for guests to be driven to the harbor for the half-hour boat ride
to Parrot Cay.
</P>
<P>
   THE RESORT
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a single private home, the
Caribbean-Indonesia style Parrot Cay is the only residence on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   There are 48 rooms and 3 bungalows that each have two
one-bedroom suites; a pair of two-bedroom beach houses have private
pools. There are two restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel offers sailing, tennis, snorkeling, fishing and
excursions to nearby islands, included in the rates. Golfers can
take the resort's boat to Providenciales, where there is an 18-hole
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanfront rooms are $850 a day and garden view rooms $620,
including breakfast, dinner and airport transfers. Dinners are
about $70 a la carte, with wine.
</P>
<P>
   The Romantic Getaway package costs $4,100 and includes five
nights in an oceanview room, all meals, a bottle of champagne,
travel to and from the airport and an excursion.

AIRLINES AND FAA AGREE TO AGREE ON WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use on Sunday, April 9)  
(ms) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For air travel, the Internet's usefulness is not
confined to checking schedules or booking flights; since April 1,
it has also been used for a rather unusual chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists have been gathering on line at least once a day
to discuss thunderstorms, as part of a new effort by the Federal
Aviation Administration and the airlines to cut traffic delays.
</P>
<P>
   There were many reasons for the horrific delays of last summer,
but one of them, according to experts who sat down later to figure
out what had gone wrong, is that nobody could agree about the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a different meteorologist,'' said Dorothy
Haldeman, who, as the aviation program manager at the National
Weather Service, is in charge of the weather forecasters for the
FAA. ``And even people who aren't meteorologists have opinions
about what's going to happen with the weather,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the only opinion that counted last year was the FAA's, and
according to the airlines, the agency sometimes instituted
elaborate delays and detours to cope with forecasted weather, and
stuck to the plan even if that weather never materialized. Another
point of friction has been the airlines' belief that their weather
forecasting and equipment is superior to the government's.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the airlines and the government say they
will collaborate closely. Some of that collaboration will be
visible to the public on the Web, although the chat room excludes
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, government and private meteorologists will
consult several times a day if necessary, and will agree on a
single weather forecast and make adjustments as conditions change.
The plan was deemed important enough to be announced by President
Clinton early last month. The airline operations managers and the
FAA will also consult, to discuss the best possible detour routes.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive information on delays is already available on the Web,
through the home page of the FAA's strategic command center in
Herndon, Va., www.atcscc.faa.gov. An advisories database, updated
frequently, shows various problems around the country. But it is so
thick with acronyms and jargon that most viewers will find it hard
to understand.
</P>
<P>
   The agency intends to add a user-friendlier version soon, on the
Web site fly.faa.gov. This will help travelers who want the big
picture, although FAA officials say that people may still be better
off calling their airlines about specific flights.
</P>
<P>
   Travel buffs can dig deeper into the strategic command center's
Web site and find an extensive list of ``escape routes'' that the
airlines and the FAA have developed as standard detours. When
weather disrupts operations, controllers can refer to the alternate
routes by predetermined code names.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines and officials at the command center will talk as
frequently as every two hours, if disruptions warrant that, to plot
strategic plans.
</P>
<P>
   (``Strategic'' means something different at the FAA than in some
slower-moving fields. ``Later in the day _ that's pretty strategic
for us,'' said Monte Belger, the acting deputy administrator.)
</P>
<P>
   The airlines and the FAA want to avoid both the delays and the
finger-pointing that were common last summer, according to people
involved in the new effort. The airlines believe that extensive
delays create a mood in which new passenger-rights legislation
could pass in Congress; the agency is also eager to avoid
congressional and public wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan for this summer has several other aspects. Airlines
and the FAA will make greater use of low-altitude routes, to avoid
traffic higher up. Airlines like their planes to climb fast, to
reach thinner air where flying takes less fuel, but they will
accept lower altitudes to cut delays, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the plan is to route planes through Canadian
airspace more often, especially those flying between destinations
like Chicago and New York. In the past that has had limited
success, agency officials said, because the Canadians have
sometimes been unable to accommodate the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, government officials say an element of luck is involved.
Jack Kies, the deputy program director for air traffic tactical
operations at the FAA, who operates the command center, said that
at planning sessions this winter, ``everybody was at the table
except Mother Nature, and we'll see how she cooperates and plays
this spring and summer.''

   An opposition group vowed to begin 100 days of prayer meetings
and peaceful demonstrations to protest the policies of President
Robert Mugabe, and his governing party. The decision by the
National Constitutional Assembly came after thugs attacked its
peaceful march over the weekend, injuring several people. The
group, which blamed the police for failing to prevent the violence,
has criticized official corruption, the unraveling economy and
Mugabe's support of black squatters on white-owned farms.

for the Protection of the Constitution said in an official report.
The number of rightists deemed likely to commit acts of violence,
however, grew by about 10 percent to 9,000, the agency said, adding
that recorded violent attacks by far rightists reached 746, up from
708 in 1998. Germany's seven million foreigners are considered
particular targets of those attacks.

Christian Democrats under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. But he
said he made little use of the information because he considered
all capitalists to be corrupt.

7 VILLAGERS IN KASHMIR SLAIN DURING ANTI-POLICE PROTEST

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Seven demonstrators against recent killings
of villagers by the police were killed in Kashmir Monday and at
least another four were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were part of a march of about 1,000 people from
their villages to the district police headquarters in Anantnag.
They were gunned down outside a police camp in the village of
Barakpura.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Indian state of Kashmir suggested that the
killings Monday were committed by militants, and separatist leaders
charged that police officers had fired on the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The police themselves originally reported that officers in the
special operations group of the state police _ charged with
combating the 11-year-old insurgency in the state _ had fired on
the marchers after being pelted with stones and perhaps even fired
on. But they later said an examination of the bodies indicated that
the shots came from behind the protesters and had been fired by
militants.
</P>
<P>
   People who had marched further back in the procession, and who
had not actually witnessed the shootings, accused the police of
shooting the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths Monday continued a cycle of violence that began with
the killing of more than 30 Sikh villagers in the state of Kashmir
two weeks ago, on the eve of President Clinton's visit to India.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, in two incidents, the police killed 11 men who were
allegedly implicated in the crime. Officials said the men were
separatist Islamic militants fighting Indian rule of Kashmir. But
villagers in the area accused the police of shooting the wrong men,
including innocent shopkeepers.

CLIPPERS' CREDIBILITY QUESTIONED
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Beyond any harsh scoreboard reality is the threat
of the Clippers losing a credibility they probably never had.
</P>
<P>
   The pointing finger can be found in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the Biggest Apple, one NBA columnist has deduced that the
healing of Maurice Taylor's ankle and Lamar Odom's calf muscle
could have an intentional link to the team's future in the May 21
NBA Draft lottery. Two recent unexpected and unexplained Chicago
victories have the Clips poised to finish the season with the
league's fewest triumphs and the most Ping-Pong ball combinations
needed to grab the top pick.
</P>
<P>
   One fly in the ointment of such nasty ink is the anticipated
list of available talent. With no Tim Duncan-type suspects on the
horizon, the top candidate for No. 1 selection has been Cincinnati
power forward Kenyon Martin. Martin, projected by scouts to be a
defensive monster with limited offensive chops, must recover from a
broken leg in time to maintain his No.1 status. But he's no
franchise messiah.
</P>
<P>
   A second problem with the theory of intentional Clipper defeat
was underscored by Taylor, who has promised to scram via free
agency at the stroke of Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I help 'em?'' said Taylor about taking one for the
team he plans to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, by the way, practiced at full speed Monday and plans to
play in tonight's game with Utah at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel cool,'' said Taylor, who has missed five game with the
bad left wheel. ``I feel better than I thought I was going to feel.
You have to give it (ankle) a chance to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom might have seconded that motion in regard to his left calf,
if he had attended the Monday morning workout. He didn't, but was
expected to receive therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be fined,'' said interim coach Jim Todd, who indicated
that the rookie probably didn't realize he was expected to report
for inactive duty. ``He'll be at shoot-around; it's possible he can
play tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom has missed three consecutive games with the injury and like
his teammates had Saturday and Sunday off. So did center Michael
Olowokandi, who arrived about an hour late Monday.

NATIONAL ZOO IS CLOSE TO ACQUIRING 2 PANDAS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Zoo, which lost one of its, and
Washington's, biggest attractions last year when its giant panda
died, is nearing an agreement with China that would bring a pair of
pandas here.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Small, the head of the Smithsonian Institution, which
runs the zoo, said Monday that the China Wildlife Conservation
Association had expressed a willingness to send the zoo two pandas
under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   One, he said, was that the Smithsonian would provide $800,000
annually for the next 10 years for wildlife preservation,
veterinary studies and habitat research in China, or $8 million.
That contribution would be somewhat less than the $10 million that
zoos in San Diego and Atlanta committed for panda pairs they
received from China.
</P>
<P>
   Small said he has raised $5.8 million of the requested $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending a team tomorrow to open discussions,'' Small
said. Many matters remain to be negotiated, he added, including
what would happen if the pair produced offspring and whether the
arrangement could be renewed after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized there was not yet an agreement, but rather ``the
possibility of an agreement.'' A call to the Chinese Embassy was
not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   China gave the National Zoo Hsing-Hsing and his mate, Ling-Ling,
in 1972 to mark the revival of American-Chinese relations. The pair
produced five offspring but none lived more than five days.
</P>
<P>
   Ling-Ling died in 1992. Hsing-Hsing was given a lethal injection
Nov. 28 after zookeepers decided that irreversible kidney disease
had made his life too painful.
</P>
<P>
   Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling were the favorites of every child, and
their adult minders, who visited the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply want to satisfy those kids,'' Small said.

 &HT;    Spurs `quietly confident' against L.A.
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Not long ago, Jerry West said he considered the
San Antonio Spurs favorites to win the NBA championship _ missed
jump shots, minor defensive warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   West, the Los Angeles Lakers' executive vice president, figures
Tim Duncan and David Robinson are that imposing, adept enough to
compensate for other deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   West is an astute basketball man who carefully measures his
words. You take him seriously. And yet, too many times you've
watched the Spurs plod along on offense. When the University of
Wisconsin dragged basketball back into the 1950s last week, the
Spurs were already there waiting with a tray of milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why ``favorite'' is not a word Spurs Coach Gregg
Popovich associates with his team. ``Discombobulated'' and
``clueless'' were commonly used by Popovich only a few weeks ago.
After all, Duncan and Malik Rose were injured, and Sean Elliott was
still trying to again approval for his return after a kidney
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Another championship? Popovich worried that he was about to
watch his team slide all the way to seventh place in the West, a
skid greased by inefficient offense and defense more generous than
statistics would indicate. The Spurs couldn't make the necessary
plays at either end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks left in the regular season, we're still not sure
if West overestimated the Spurs or if Popovich's worst fears have
merit. His team now alternates between fourth and fifth place in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the uncommon circumstances under which Elliott
works, the Spurs can only be viewed as an interesting and inspiring
story.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they look downright spry, at least as much as can be
expected from a team old enough to get into the movies for half
price. They won five straight games, including victories in Seattle
and Portland on consecutive nights last week, before losing at
Miami on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, San Antonio ranks 21st in the NBA in scoring,
thanks mostly to perimeter players less reliable than your old
Pinto.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Spurs advance in spite of that. As expected, when they
make any forward movement, Duncan and Robinson have provided the
push. Duncan no longer is working through an injury-induced
decrease in production: 16.8 points and 8.0 rebounds during eight
games after he returned from a strained lower abdominal muscle. In
his last seven games, Duncan averaged 25.6 points and 14.4
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has been forceful since January, dismissing any notion
that damaged knees and a sore back might finally torpedo the
Admiral's career. The Spurs center averaged 13.4 points during his
first 27 games. He has improved to 19.9 points during the last 43
games, relying more on a running hook shot in the lane and the
innate quickness available when he is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the Spurs should be watched with a mix of
anticipation and skepticism during the final nine games of the
regular season. Elliott, just 10 games into his comeback, is still
the Spurs' best defender on the perimeter, a role he must play
against the Lakers' Kobe Bryant, Portland's Scottie Pippen and
several others. Elliott hopes next to rediscover his offensive
skills, a goal he moved toward with three three-point baskets at
Miami on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs also need help from backup guard Terry Porter, who
returned Sunday after missing 13 games with a knee injury. When
healthy, Fourth-Quarter Porter gives the Spurs a reliable shooter.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have two games left with West's Lakers, winners of 28
of their last 29 games _ Saturday in L.A. and April 19 in the
Alamodome. They split their first two games, with the Lakers
winning by six at home and the Spurs by 24 in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs might match up better with L.A. than does any other
team. Shaquille O'Neal is the clear choice for MVP, but he can
guard either Duncan or Robinson, not both. O'Neal incurred foul
trouble trying to stop Duncan during the game in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why some Spurs have at least a partial view from
West's vantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a great chance, I really do,'' Elliott said.
``A lot of guys on the team are quietly confident we can throw
something together.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It wasn't just Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index endured one of its worst days ever
Monday, as technology stocks broadly sold off. The decline, of 7.6
percent, was the worst daily performance for the index since the
summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is just one of the 4,827 stocks in the Nasdaq
composite but makes up 8.5 percent of the value of the index, was
responsible for only about one-sixth of the record 349.15-point
decline. Its shares fell $15.375, to $90.875 _ shaving $80 billion
off the company's market value _ as investors waited for the ruling
that the company had violated antitrust laws, a ruling made after
the end of regular trading.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nasdaq wipeout was far broader than Microsoft. Of the
100 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 _ generally the largest companies in
the Nasdaq composite index _86 fell in value. They included some of
the highest fliers heretofore, like Cisco Systems, which for a time
last month was the most valuable company in the country, and
Qualcomm, the mobile phone technology company that is now down
nearly 30 percent from the peak it reached in the first trading day
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it was the fifth-worst day ever for the index, measured
by percentages, trailing just the 8.6 percent fall of Aug. 31,
1998, and three days during the 1987 stock market crash. The 1998
fall came amid worry that the world's financial system was
crumbling, and the 1987 falls came as the entire American stock
market seemed to be collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Monday's move came on a day when many stocks were
doing quite well, thank you. The Dow Jones industrial average
leaped 2.7 percent Monday _ and would have been up 3.7 percent had
it not been weighed down by the changes Dow Jones made last
November, when it added Microsoft and Intel to the list.
</P>
<P>
   Just what the Nasdaq plunge means _ or whether it means much of
anything at all _ is not easy to analyze because volatility in the
Nasdaq market has been running at record levels this year, and big
falls have often been followed by equally large rebounds. The
Nasdaq composite is down 14.8 percent from the peak it reached
March 10. But it is still up 3.8 percent since the end of last
year. The Dow, by contrast, is up 13 percent since March 10, but is
down 2.4 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of opposite movement for the Dow and the Nasdaq is far
from common. The Nasdaq index, which dates back to 1971, has seen
41 daily declines of at least 3 percent prior to this year. The Dow
had declined on 40 of those days, the only exception being on Oct.
20, 1987, the day after the worst day of the 1987 crash. That
exception reflected not so much investor sentiment about the
relative weakness of the Nasdaq issues but a quirk of the previous
day. The decline in Nasdaq the day before had been smaller than the
Dow's because many of the brokers that made Nasdaq markets chose
not to answer their phones, and thus kept reported prices
artificially high.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Nasdaq has gyrated wildly this year, the Dow has
often moved to a different drummer. Of the 11 days in 2000 on which
the Nasdaq has fallen at least 3 percent, four of them have seen
the Dow go up.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, it appears that the new-economy stocks that
zoomed last year and early this year are falling. Meanwhile, the
old-economy stocks that did not rise much if at all last year and
early in 2000 are gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, which rose $5.375 to $161 Monday, is again the
most valuable company in the land, with a market value of $530.5
billion, compared with $506 billion for Cisco and $473 billion for
Microsoft, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets. A week ago, GE
was in third place.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is among the most widely held stocks in the country,
both in individual portfolios and in mutual funds. But the extent
to which holders were hurt Monday depended largely on what else was
held. Diversified funds with many large stocks were not badly
damaged, while funds concentrated in technology stocks were. The
Fidelity Magellan Fund, for which Microsoft was the largest holding
at last report, was off just 0.3 percent Monday, in part because
General Electric was the fund's second-largest holding. But the
Fidelity OTC Portfolio and the Fidelity Select Technology Fund, for
which Microsoft was also the largest holding, fell 7.8 and 9.2
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The easy-come, easy-go nature of this market is illustrated by
the PBHG Technology and Communications Fund, which fell 13.6
percent Monday. At its peak on March 9, the fund was up 71.5
percent from the end of 1999. Now its gain for the year has been
cut to 7.9 percent.

   $1.3 MILLION FOR NONPROFIT GROUP
</P>
<P>
   A nonprofit group allied with the House majority whip, Rep. Tom
DeLay of Texas, raised $1.3 million in 1998 from five donors,
including one that contributed $1 million, according to tax records
reviewed and reported on Monday by Roll Call, a Capitol Hill
newspaper. The group, U.S. Family Network, run by Robert Mills, a
former campaign manager for DeLay, was created under section
501(c)4 of the tax code, which means the names of donors do not
need to be publicly disclosed, though their contributions are not
tax-deductible. The group's largest known supporter is the National
Republican Congressional Committee, which contributed $500,000 in
1999. U.S. Family's records for 1999 will not be filed until
November. Public records show that the group has lobbied Congress
for four years on issues like prayer in public schools, although
Roll Call reported that U.S. Family Network officials did not
formally register as lobbyists until February.
</P>
<P>
   THREE NEW POLLS
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas holds an 18-point lead over Vice
President Al Gore in the latest poll on the presidential race taken
in Indiana and a 4-point lead in the latest Pennsylvania poll. But
a poll from Wisconsin has the two men in a dead heat. In the
Indiana poll, in which The Indianapolis Star surveyed 825 voters on
March 26-29 (margin of error plus or minus 3.5 percentage points),
Bush led 54 percent to 36 percent, with Pat Buchanan getting 4
percent and 5 percent undecided. In the Pennsylvania poll, in which
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette surveyed 855 voters March 28-30 (margin
of error plus or minus 5 points), Bush led Gore 44 percent to 40
percent, with Buchanan getting 5 percent and 11 percent undecided.
In the Wisconsin poll, in which The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
surveyed 574 voters March 9-23 (margin of error plus or minus 4
points), Bush and Gore were tied at 46 percent each, with 8 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ANTI-ASBESTOS ADS
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos legislation in Congress is the latest subject to find
its way into issue advertising in this year's campaigns. In
Minnesota, a coalition of labor, environmental and consumer groups,
along with trial lawyers, is behind a television advertisement
against Sen. Rod Grams. Grams, a Republican seeking a second term,
is a co-sponsor of the bill that would set up a system to screen
asbestos victims and essentially allow only the seriously injured
to be compensated. The advertisement flashes a 1964 photo of
Minneapolis plant workers, a dozen of whom have since died from
asbestos-related disease, and accuses Grams of ``pushing
legislation to let the asbestos companies off the hook.'' Gram's
campaign manager, Pat Fiske, would not comment on the
advertisement. Its producers say similar commercials may be used in
the districts of as many as 20 House and Senate co-sponsors, many
of whom face tough re-election battles. One commercial was
broadcast in January in Montana against Conrad Burns. Burns and
Rep. Rick Hill, both Montana Republicans, later withdrew their
support for the asbestos bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXPENSIVE STATE RACE
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive state Senate race in Texas history is
developing east of Houston in Senate district 13. At stake is the
Republicans' razor-thin 16-15 majority in the Texas Senate and the
ability to select Lt. Gov. Rick Perry's successor if Gov. George W.
Bush should become president. Perry, who could also lose control of
the Senate if a Democrat won the seat, said in a fund-raising
letter on behalf of the Republican candidate, ``This contest is
personally important to me.'' State Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, head
of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, told The Dallas
Morning News that the race would determine which party ``has the
political power in Texas.'' State Rep. Todd Staples, the
Republican, and the Democrat, David Fisher, a lawyer, spent heavily
to win their respective primaries for the vacant seat, and experts
say strong statewide interest in the race could push expenditures
for the campaigns to between $4 million and $8 million. &QL;

 &HT;    Spurs `quietly confident' against L.A.
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Not long ago, Jerry West said he considered the
San Antonio Spurs favorites to win the NBA championship _ missed
jump shots, minor defensive warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   West, the Los Angeles Lakers' executive vice president, figures
Tim Duncan and David Robinson are that imposing, adept enough to
compensate for other deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   West is an astute basketball man who carefully measures his
words. You take him seriously. And yet, too many times you've
watched the Spurs plod along on offense. When the University of
Wisconsin dragged basketball back into the 1950s last week, the
Spurs were already there waiting with a tray of milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why ``favorite'' is not a word Spurs Coach Gregg
Popovich associates with his team. ``Discombobulated'' and
``clueless'' were commonly used by Popovich only a few weeks ago.
After all, Duncan and Malik Rose were injured, and Sean Elliott was
still trying to again approval for his return after a kidney
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Another championship? Popovich worried that he was about to
watch his team slide all the way to seventh place in the West, a
skid greased by inefficient offense and defense more generous than
statistics would indicate. The Spurs couldn't make the necessary
plays at either end of the court.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks left in the regular season, we're still not sure
if West overestimated the Spurs or if Popovich's worst fears have
merit. His team now alternates between fourth and fifth place in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the uncommon circumstances under which Elliott
works, the Spurs can only be viewed as an interesting and inspiring
story.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they look downright spry, at least as much as can be
expected from a team old enough to get into the movies for half
price. They won five straight games, including victories in Seattle
and Portland on consecutive nights last week, before losing at
Miami on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, San Antonio ranks 21st in the NBA in scoring,
thanks mostly to perimeter players less reliable than your old
Pinto.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Spurs advance in spite of that. As expected, when they
make any forward movement, Duncan and Robinson have provided the
push. Duncan no longer is working through an injury-induced
decrease in production: 16.8 points and 8.0 rebounds during eight
games after he returned from a strained lower abdominal muscle. In
his last seven games, Duncan averaged 25.6 points and 14.4
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has been forceful since January, dismissing any notion
that damaged knees and a sore back might finally torpedo the
Admiral's career. The Spurs center averaged 13.4 points during his
first 27 games. He has improved to 19.9 points during the last 43
games, relying more on a running hook shot in the lane and the
innate quickness available when he is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the Spurs should be watched with a mix of
anticipation and skepticism during the final nine games of the
regular season. Elliott, just 10 games into his comeback, is still
the Spurs' best defender on the perimeter, a role he must play
against the Lakers' Kobe Bryant, Portland's Scottie Pippen and
several others. Elliott hopes next to rediscover his offensive
skills, a goal he moved toward with three three-point baskets at
Miami on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs also need help from backup guard Terry Porter, who
returned Sunday after missing 13 games with a knee injury. When
healthy, Fourth-Quarter Porter gives the Spurs a reliable shooter.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have two games left with West's Lakers, winners of 28
of their last 29 games _ Saturday in L.A. and April 19 in the
Alamodome. They split their first two games, with the Lakers
winning by six at home and the Spurs by 24 in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs might match up better with L.A. than does any other
team. Shaquille O'Neal is the clear choice for MVP, but he can
guard either Duncan or Robinson, not both. O'Neal incurred foul
trouble trying to stop Duncan during the game in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why some Spurs have at least a partial view from
West's vantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a great chance, I really do,'' Elliott said.
``A lot of guys on the team are quietly confident we can throw
something together.''

 &HT;    At consumer PC level, changes will be subtle
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the earth shifted for Microsoft as a company
with Monday's ruling, consumers should not expect immediate changes
in how Windows _ Microsoft's most visible and important product _
works.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will a walk down the aisles of the computer store be any
different tomorrow. Any drastic changes in the marketplace would
come after the penalty stage of the antitrust case, which will
come, at the earliest, this summer. Even then, a lengthy appeal
process is likely and could further delay things.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, too, that no one knows just what changes the
courts might force Microsoft to make. That would be part of the
penalty stage. But there are some likely scenarios that affect the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key issues of the antitrust case was the fact that
Microsoft included its Web browser _ Explorer _ as a built-in part
of Windows. Microsoft said that was a necessary technological
improvement. Some competitors and the government charged that
Microsoft was taking unfair advantage of Windows' dominance.
Windows has about 85 percent of the market as an operating system,
the software that teaches your computer to be a computer.
</P>
<P>
   If it was Microsoft's intent to hitch its browser to Windows'
star, it worked. In 1996, Explorer had just 18 percent of the
market, and the Netscape Navigator browser had almost all the rest.
In 1998, when the antitrust suit was filed, Explorer had 50
percent. It has more than 60 percent of the market today.
</P>
<P>
   It's probable that the courts will force Microsoft to separate
Explorer and Windows. It's possible Microsoft might be required to
include _ right on the disc that Windows comes on _ copies of
competing Web browsers. With that help from the courts to create a
level field for competing browsers, there may be more innovation.
</P>
<P>
   However, something a lot less pleasant for consumers could also
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Explorer and Navigator are available free for the
downloading on the Internet. Ironically, competition could change
that.
</P>
<P>
   Some competing browsers, such as one called Opera from Oslo,
Norway-based Opera Software, already are distributed through
commercial channels. Opera costs $35. If the emphasis in the
marketplace shifts from getting as much free distribution as
possible to using expensive resources and manpower to create the
best commercial product, users could end up being forced to pay for
any browser that they choose _ including Explorer and Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   The next possible remedy from the courts would be to require
that Microsoft make the inner workings of its Windows software
available to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That's important, since Microsoft also sells the leading word
processor, Word, and the leading spreadsheet program, Excel.
Competing word processors and spreadsheets for PCs have to be
designed to operate using Windows, and that creates a real
advantage for Microsoft. It knows just how future versions of
Windows will work and can get a head start creating the programs
that work with it.
</P>
<P>
   But the courts could require that Microsoft keep competitors in
the loop, making the code _ the program language itself _ freely
available.
</P>
<P>
   Before the dominance of Windows, the marketplace was crowded
with word processors and spreadsheets. Help from the courts to
competing companies almost certainly would mean a shift in the
marketplace balance back to the days of more competition, more
products.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is one thing to keep in mind while forecasting
the future of technology: The drive has always been for a standard.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when there were competing versions of VCRs _ VHS
and Beta _ the marketplace eventually settled on one standard, VHS.
Standards are needed because businesses and home users want
products that work seamlessly with the software that they power. In
the case of VCRs, that was movies. In the case of computers, it's
programs.
</P>
<P>
   So it is unlikely that the dominance of Windows will go away.
While there are challengers, the most notable being Apple's
Macintosh operating software and the increasingly popular Linux
operating system, the odds are that Windows _ because of the head
start it now has _ will remain a familiar sight on most computer
screens.

LAWYER FOR ELIAN'S FATHER IS NO STRANGER TO CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
   (With CUBAN-BOY) 
(rk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the wall of Gregory Craig's office at the
powerhouse law firm Williams &AMP; Connolly here is a fading photograph
taken 14 years ago of Craig shaking hands with a gaunt 60-year-old
Cuban-American man at Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was taken the day in 1986 when Col. Ricardo Montero
Duque was released from a Cuban jail after serving 25 years for
counterrevolutionary violence. Duque was the last imprisoned senior
officer from the brigade of Cuban exiles who stormed the shores of
Cuba in the futile Bay of Pigs invasion of 1961.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba set Duque free at the urging of
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who sent his senior foreign policy aide,
Craig, to Cuba to accompany him home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Craig is embroiled in another drama involving
Cuban-American relations, this time as the lawyer for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, father of 6-year-old shipwreck victim, Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's appearance as Gonzalez's lawyer has been a bit of a
surprise to official Washington, which last saw him delivering a
defense of presidential peccadilloes before the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton enlisted Craig to coordinate his legal and
political defense against impeachment charges in part because of
longtime personal ties _ Craig was friendly with Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton at Yale Law School in the early 1970s. But
the White House also sought Craig's services because of his
well-tuned ear for congressional politics and his ability to pursue
an aggressive legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   When he was approached by representatives of church groups
sympathetic to Gonzalez, he accepted the job after consulting with
top officials of the White House, the Department of Justice and the
State Department, where Craig had been director of the policy
planning staff earlier in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   His fee is being paid through a fund-raising effort led by the
Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, until recently the general secretary of
the National Council of Churches, who helped recruit Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's experience has been put to work during the tense
negotiations between the Justice Department and Elian's Florida
relatives, and as Gonzalez and other family members in Cuba prepare
to come to the United States to be with Elian while the legal
process plays out.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Craig said he felt strongly that
Gonzalez should be peacefully and quickly reunited with his son; he
had harsh words for the Cuban-Americans in Miami threatening to try
to prevent the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he believed that Gonzalez, his new wife and his
children would be in danger in Miami because of the depth of
feeling the case has aroused and would be safer waiting in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are better off here in Washington than in South
Florida,'' he said. ``There is a quasi-insurgency underway down
there with emotions very, very high and people announcing their
willingness to sacrifice their lives. I take that at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Craig said, sentiments are less passionate,
though no less treacherous. As for Vice President Al Gore, who last
week broke with the administration and sided with the Miami
relatives and those seeking political advantage by advocating their
position, Craig adopted a diplomatic silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in agreement with the position taken by the president and
the attorney general,'' he stressed. ``Enough said.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who is 55, has served as advocate for a number of
unpopular clients and causes.
</P>
<P>
   He helped construct the successful insanity defense of John
Hinckley, the assailant who almost killed President Reagan in 1981.
He advised his former boss, Kennedy, in the Florida rape case
involving Kennedy's nephew, William Kennedy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   He represented one of Haiti's wealthiest families, the Mevs, in
their efforts to persuade the Bush and Clinton administrations to
protect their sugar and oil interests in the political chaos
following the overthrow of Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were involved in a controversy or a very difficult
thing, Greg's the guy you'd want in your corner,'' said a senior
White House official who worked with Craig on the defense of
Clinton against perjury and obstruction of justice charges. ``He is
very articulate and very passionate. And he has a solid moral
compass.''

   FATMA PASSAGE, Israeli-Lebanese Border _ Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Monday that he did not expect a military confrontation
after Israeli troops withdraw from southern Lebanon this summer,
and that he foresaw no need for a significantly larger
multinational peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   But here on the border, the commander of Israel's southern
Lebanese allies radiated anxiety about the consequences of the
planned withdrawal for the residents of a region that has been a
proxy battleground for Middle Eastern adversaries. The commander,
Gen. Antoine Lahad, wearing soft white leather loafers and a
worried expression, said defiantly that his forces would not
disband and flee but stay put and ``defend their land unto the
death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to stay in their homes,'' he said of his people.
``They want to die in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Barak moves steadily closer to his July deadline for ending
the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, his hopes for doing so
in the context of an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement are fading
fast. Speaking sanguinely in Jerusalem Monday, he addressed a
rising concern that a unilateral troop withdrawal could produce
violent chaos in the border region or even provoke a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that there is an immediate danger of a
flare-up of any kind,'' he said, expressing determined confidence
that Israel's military strength, combined with international
support for its withdrawal, would discourage any attempt to
escalate the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The military forces in this border region have moved into full
preparation for a complete shake-up of the decades-long balance of
power in the nine-mile-deep buffer zone. Locked in their war rooms,
the Israeli army, the South Lebanese militia, the U.N. forces and
the Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas are all devising battle
plans, and end-of-battle plans.
</P>
<P>
   At the physical heart of the security zone conflict is the
Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army commanded by Lahad, who strongly
opposes a unilateral pullout by Israel. ``If it is Israel's
decision to leave without security or peace established, well, then
it is Israel's decision,'' he said at a briefing sponsored by the
Israeli army. But he also said Monday, for the first time since the
Israeli Cabinet voted to withdraw the troops, that he and his
fighters had decided not to abandon their struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Lahad said he had changed his mind about seeking asylum abroad
now that the possibility of Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese
agreements are dimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm responsible not only for the South Lebanese Army, but for
the 70,000 to 80,000 people in the area,'' said the general, who
was widely believed to be contemplating a new life in France, where
his family lives. ``I would be viewed by them as a traitor if I
left now.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace agreements would presumably have spelled out the future
for the population of the security zone and for the 2,500 fighters
of the South Lebanese Army, many of whom have been convicted of
treason by the Lebanese military courts and sentenced in absentia
to punishments including death.
</P>
<P>
   Without such agreements, Lahad said his soldiers would defy
Lebanese forces seeking to regain control of the area unless they
were granted amnesty for their convictions in absentia. Using a
very strong analogy, he mentioned the ``Masada precedent,''
referring to the ancient Jews who committed suicide on a hilltop
above the Dead Sea rather than be taken captive by Romans.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli journalist, Yoram Hamizrahi, who used to be a
commander in southern Lebanon, said on the Israeli radio Monday
that Lahad's extreme statements ``should not be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Lebanon, they say, ``There is no tax on words,''' he said.
``Antoine Lahad is not going to kill himself. There is not going to
be any Masada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who believes that the SLA, which is supported by the
Israeli army, can suddenly turn into an army of heroes that can
fight on its own against Hezbollah _ anyone who believes that is an
utter fool,'' Hamizrahi said. ``Yet Antoine Lahad's statements
today are dangerous because they hint that the fence will not be
closed, they hint that southern Lebanon will remain under Israeli
patronage.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat out of sync with Lahad's thinking, a senior Israeli
military official made an unequivocal pledge Monday on behalf of
Israel to take care of the southern Lebanese. Standing by the side
of his South Lebanese Army counterpart, Brig. Gen. Beni Ganz said
Israel would be ready to absorb the entire population of the
southern Lebanon security zone if it sought refuge in Israel. Ganz
quickly said that it was more a statement of principle than a
concrete plan, because most of the Lebanese have no desire to
become refugees in Israel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Israeli army is believed to be scouting locations for
the resettlement of South Lebanese Army soldiers _ in the northern
towns of Nahariya and Metulla, for instance _ and to be negotiating
with third countries to relocate some high-ranking officers.
</P>
<P>
   In Metulla, eight Israeli employers have banded together to seek
government permission to sponsor the relocation of their 100
southern Lebanese workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even begin to tell you how terrified they all are,''
said Miriam Hod, 49, who owns the Bet Shalom Motel. ``They're sure
they're going to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can barely function, they're so worried. I think that the
state of Israel has a moral obligation towards these people. There
is going to be a massacre there. I am the daughter of Holocaust
survivors, and I know we have to do something to save them.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to such anxiety, Ganz said he believed that the
withdrawal would take place in the context of some kind of
``arrangement,'' if not a peace agreement. He presumably referred
to an arrangement with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak said his confidence that violent chaos would be
averted was partly inspired by his ``memory of how effective the
Lebanese were in disarming other militias and pacifying other parts
of Lebanon.'' He said he believed that the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon, which comprises 4,500 troops, would be able to handle the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure that there will be a need for any extra
forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who stood by Barak's
side Monday, added that he did not believe that U.S. troops would
get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Barak continued: ``If there is a will, there is a way to solve
this issue. But we are not going to lead it. We will pull out to
the border out of our own interests, and we will defend Israel and
its interests from our borders. We don't have a claim on a single
square mile of Lebanese territory.''

 &HT;    If breakup occurs, company, consumers benefit
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ What we learned through most of the last century was
that virtually all attempts to destroy the monopolistic hold of big
companies had several outcomes, all good for the economy, and in
reasonably short order.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of the Rockefeller empire 90 years ago unleashed
huge growth in oil and enriched the holders of securities as each
of the individual parts of Standard Oil prospered on its own.
</P>
<P>
   As we have recalled frequently, the breakup of American
Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. into regional parts, and separating the
equipment and product development businesses, enriched
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T shareholders enormously.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases smart, smaller companies burst forth with growth
when the canopy of the big company was removed. The breakup of the
Rockefeller oil colossus gave us a wealth of new refined oil
products and services, and ultimately cheaper energy.
</P>
<P>
   The dissolution of the rigid old motherly phone company gave way
to younger, smarter managers and allowed the regional phone
companies to grow with the fast-stepping service area, then branch
into global enterprises like wireless communication.
</P>
<P>
   In all cases the consumer came out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Why should the ``breakup'' of the Microsoft grip on computing
and telecommunications be an exception?
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory of Jagdish Sheth, the deep thinker about
marketing at business strategy at Emory's Goizueta Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that regardless of the details, if the government
succeeds in breaking up the Microsoft monopoly, the company wins,''
Sheth said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Charles Brown, chairman of AT&AMP;T, complained bitterly
about government intervention in his company's affairs during the
years leading to that breakup, only to see the whole Bell family
enriched, bitterly critical Bill Gates will come out richer and
probably happier, Sheth said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because all shareholders will likely come out well, and
Gates is the biggest shareholder of them all.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: While we all know Microsoft as the software mogul
that created the Windows operating system and dominates that field,
Microsoft has, in fact, been changing. The company has been
changing into a service company, not just a maker of software to
run computers.
</P>
<P>
   The company has become a major player in the Internet portal
business, powering MSN into a site behind only America Online and
Yahoo. It has helped to produce other sites and to address urban
markets, even one offered in conjunction with BET to address
African-American interests.
</P>
<P>
   It has invested in cable services, with a strong leaning toward
wireless and satellite applications.
</P>
<P>
   As Sheth sees it, Microsoft will fight like a tiger to protect
its Windows franchise, possibly stretching the combat out for
years. It's enormously profitable _ why not?
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the company will likely be ceaseless in
probing service ideas in the area of wireless communication,
delivering high-speed communication as well as video by way of
television. All of these services need software, Microsoft's strong
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, as portal developer, is already a competitor with
AOL. It is possible, many analysts believe, that the company could
evolve, as AOL has, into a pipeline company that devises numerous
ways to deliver to homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In time it could become a merger partner, too, as AOL has with
Time Warner, and be ready for a content provider to help fill not
just pipelines but the air _ with wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   As it probes the markets, looking for innovative ways to grow,
Microsoft becomes more exciting, more of a live wire in the vast
new merged business of telecommunications, video and wireless
communication. It becomes a company more enticing to the best minds
in digital technology and the marketing of services.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk to the Goizueta Business School recently, Gary
Hamel, the Harvard futurist, talked about the differences between
old-line companies, wedded to theories of slow, incremental growth,
and the nimble small companies devoted to innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably Microsoft, threatened with becoming an incremental
company, weaving its annual upgrades of Windows, has turned a
corner and is now becoming more the innovator, thinking outside its
old box, under the guidance of the new Bill Gates, chief of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   So the reality is, we don't have to wait years for the outcome
of a federal lawsuit to glimpse the new Microsoft. It is at hand,
and we have only to watch.

USA TODAY REDESIGN TONES DOWN IMAGE AND CUTS PAPER COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost two decades after the splashy birth of USA Today, with
its vivid colors and snappy graphics, Monday's issue introduced a
makeover with pages and sections designed to present a more sober
image.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign of USA Today, which was six months in the planning,
also includes a reduction in the web size of the paper _ the width
of a paper roll from which four pages are produced _ from 54 inches
to 50. This change will save USA Today's owner, the Gannett Co., 7
percent on the newspaper's paper costs, said its publisher, Tom
Curley.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're trying to do is come up with a cleaner
look,'' he said of the redesign, which was done by Richard Curtis,
who also created the original design in 1982. ``We didn't want to
shout at readers as much as we had in the past. There's a conscious
effort to tone it down. In a white-hot media market, where all the
media are shouting, we really want to tone it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The new web configuration means the width of each page will be
reduced by about an inch and expanded in length by a half-inch,
Curley said. USA Today has also shifted to a taller and narrower
typeface. These combined changes, Curley said, will mean eight
inches more of text on each page, while preserving legibililty.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today is following other large newspapers in reducing the
size of pages to save on the cost of paper and ink. In 1998, The
Washington Post narrowed the size of its pages, and more recently
The Boston Globe started to make the shift.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co., is
converting its presses to produce smaller newspaper pages from a
54-inch web size to 50. Some of its readers are already getting the
new versions, though The Globe is not expected to complete the
conversion until September, when the makeover will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our reduction to a 50-inch size seems to be something that a
lot of newspapers are doing, prompted by the savings that occur,''
said Richard Gulla, a spokesman for The Globe. ``Our thinking was
that while we were going to this size, a new graphic design will be
more friendly.'' He said the paper has a redesign almost 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times also considered reducing the size of its page
width but decided to continue printing the newspaper on a 54-inch
web size, said Nancy Nielsen, a spokesman for the company.
``Maintaining our size supports the needs of our advertisers and
readers who look to The Times as a distinctive national
newspaper,'' she said. ``The extra space gives them a broader
canvas for ads and content.''
</P>
<P>
   Before it shifted to a narrower size, USA Today held focus
groups among readers to gauge reaction of a new look. Curley said
readers were willing to expect some change, though not if it meant
shifting features to different places. He said the basic section
features would remain in the same places.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has really been a two-pronged effort,'' Curley said,
calling newsprint USA Today's biggest single expense. ``Saving 7
percent is large and needs to be considered,'' he said. ``Secondly,
we had not done much in redesign in the 18 years since it was
started. So we were at a point to make some changes there as
well.'' &QL;

BUSH CALLS FOR MAKING CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED SITES EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa.)  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. _ Unveiling his first set of detailed
environmental proposals since he began his presidential campaign,
Gov. George W. Bush announced a plan Monday to spur the cleanup of
contaminated, abandoned industrial sites by easing certain federal
regulations, protecting redevelopers from federal liability and
giving states broader discretion over the use of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The sites, known as brownfields, are especially prevalent in and
near cities, and Bush said that excessive federal interference had
created a disincentive for companies to rehabilitate these
properties and instead encouraged them to seek out undeveloped
sites for their factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old system of mandate, regulate and litigate only sends
potential developers off in search of greener pastures _
literally,'' the Texas governor said in a speech at a manufacturing
plant in Aliquippa, outside Pittsburgh, that was built on newly
purified ground. ``Brownfields get passed over, while greenfields
get paved over.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added that he and other Republican governors had launched
successful initiatives to stem that trend, but had done so almost
in spite of the current administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't wait for Al Gore to wave his magic wand to clean up
our environment,'' Bush told reporters at a news conference
immediately following his speech. ``We cleaned it up ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks and proposals represented his first serious foray
as a presidential candidate into an area of policy that many
political analysts view as a potential liability for him. By
several environmental measures, Texas ranks as one of the most
polluted states in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor has been using the early weeks of his general
election campaign to stake out issues, like education, that often
receive more attention from Democrats and are often used as wedges
against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And he did not seem the least bit daunted by the fact that the
vice president claims his expertise on the environment as one of
his greatest strengths. Gore even wrote a best-selling book,
``Earth in the Balance,'' on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that Gore was too wedded to bureaucratic federal
solutions and cast himself as someone who better understands the
need to foster business growth while still maintaining a respect
for the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every environmental issue confronts us with a duty to be good
stewards,'' Bush said. ``As we use nature's gifts, we must do so
wisely. Prosperity will mean little if we leave future generations
a world of polluted air, toxic lakes and rivers and vanished
forests.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore said that Bush's actions in office belied those
words, and they immediately dismissed his plan, which they
acknowledged they had not yet digested, as an attempt to divert
attention from his environmental record.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of whitewashing can cover up Bush's bad record on
the environment,'' said Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway added that on an array of environmental problems,
including brownfields, ``you can bet that more progress would be
made with a trusted, long-term environmentalist at the helm rather
than someone who's tied so closely to the oil companies and
polluting industries in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Weiss, the political director for the Sierra Club, an
environmental advocacy group, said that he feared that Bush's call
for federal cleanup standards with more flexibility translated into
a desire to relax those regulations in ways that might endanger
public health.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton administration officials said that they had already
put into effect several aspects of Bush's plan, including tailoring
cleanup standards for brownfields to the intended use of the
property. A site slated for a manufacturing plant, for example,
would have to meet less rigid criteria than a site slated for a
school.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental officials estimate that there are about 450,000
brownfields nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that his plan would allow flexibility in
rehabilitating those properties only after establishing high
standards for any and all cleanup projects. His goal, he said, was
to allow and encourage state and local governments to devise
innovative solutions to the problem, rather than miring them in red
tape.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said that he also wanted to enact legislation to
grant developers who met national standards while rehabilitating
properties protection from federal liability if the site is later
deemed to be contaminated and the contamination was not the
developers' fault. Such liability, he said, scares developers away.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush proposed that existing federal funds for the
rehabilitation of brownfields be focused more intensely on the
development of new cleanup technologies; that federal loan programs
for such cleanup projects be transformed into block grants for
states, to be administered according to states' more flexible
regulations; and that a current tax incentive for such projects be
extended permanently. That incentive is due to expire at the end of
2001.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The governor squarely challenged the notion that Gore would be a
better protector of the environment by criticizing aspects of the
Clinton administration's environmental record and extolling
elements of his own.
</P>
<P>
   He said that many industrial sites and parks owned by the
federal government violate environmental standards with impunity
and that he, as president, would order them to comply with the
environmental laws that apply to privately owned land.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he cited a program he began in 1995 that he said
has led to the rehabilitation of brownfields in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These successful state programs show that America needs a
different vision where what counts is what you do, not what you
promise,'' Bush said. ``The old vision distrusts markets. It
distrusts local government. It distrusts solutions that do not
originate in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his case in a largely industrial state that promises
to be one of the fiercest battlegrounds in the general election.
Partly because Pennsylvania is considered to be up for grabs, its
Republican governor, Tom Ridge, is one of the names that political
analysts mention most frequently as a possible running mate for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge was snug at Bush's side almost from the minute Bush
arrived in Pittsburgh around midday to when the two traveled to
Harrisburg, the state capital, early Monday night. Bush made
repeated references to their close friendship. Ridge smiled broadly
every time.

WALL STREET JOURNAL ADDS A TOP EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Wall Street Journal named Stephen Adler as a
deputy managing editor on Monday, bringing to three the number of
editors in that rank and expanding the cadre of top newsroom
managers responsible for finding new outlets for the newspaper's
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Adler, like his fellow deputy managing editors Daniel Hertzberg
and Byron E. Calame, will report to the managing editor, Paul E.
Steiger. Steiger said in an interview that he ``needs to be more
involved'' in the newspaper's efforts to ``find ways to extend our
journalism outside the bounds of the paper,'' into electronic
products, books, and other media.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal, which is published by Dow Jones &AMP; Co., has an
average daily circulation of 1,753,000. It is the second-largest
circulation newspaper in the country, after USA Today, which is
owned by Gannett Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Adler's responsibilities will include coordination with The
Interactive Journal, whose Web site, wsj.com, has a
subscription-based readership of about 400,000. Adler will also
retain responsibility for The Journal's investigative reporting
team.

SANTA ANITA DERBY HORSES DESERVE TRIPLE CROWN RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif._ No matter what happens in Saturday's $1 million
Santa Anita Derby, recent history tells us we'd better respect any
horse that comes out of the Grade I event and runs in the Triple
Crown races.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   -- Charismatic finished fourth in last year's Santa Anita Derby,
beaten 8 1/4 lengths by General Challenge, and went on to win both
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Real Quiet lost to stablemate Indian Charlie in 1998, then
won the first two legs of the Triple Crown before losing to Victory
Gallop in the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   -- Silver Charm parlayed a second-place finish to rival Free
House in the '97 Santa Anita Derby into victories in the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1995, Wayne Lukas' Timber Country ran fourth at Arcadia
and won the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tabasco Cat was second-best to Brocco in the 1994 Santa Anita
Derby, but won the final two legs of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more. Lots more.
</P>
<P>
   -- A.P. Indy won the 1992 Santa Anita Derby and later captured
the Belmont after missing both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   -- Winning Colors (1988) and Sunday Silence ('89) followed
victories in the Santa Anita Derby with Kentucky Derby wins.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 14 horses that ran in the Santa Anita Derby went on to
post Kentucky Derby victories. Eight of those horses won here on
Derby Day before heading to Churchill Downs, the most recent being
Sunday Silence in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) I still don't like Lukas' filly, Surfside, in
Saturday's race, which will be run at 1 1/8 miles over the main
track -- an eighth of a mile shorter than the Kentucky Derby
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Surfside has won four consecutive graded stakes and seven
of nine races overall. She's well-seasoned and conditioned by a
trainer who's won three of the past five Kentucky Derbies and four
overall.
</P>
<P>
   The horse is a daughter of Triple Crown champion Seattle Slew
and Lukas has already won the Kentucky Derby with a filly (see
Winning Colors, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   So why don't I like her?
</P>
<P>
   Simple. She's beaten an ordinary crop of fillies, and in less
than scintillating fashion to boot. She's going to have to take a
major step forward to beat this talented field Saturday, and I just
don't see it.
</P>
<P>
   Either jockey Pat Day and Lukas are the best sandbaggers in
recent memory, or the Surfside camp's plans to run against the boys
again on the first Saturday in May will be scrapped soon after the
Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Undeterred by Worldy Manner's seventh-place finish in
last year's Kentucky Derby, sheiks Maktoum al Maktoum and Mohammed
al Maktoum are ready to try again.
</P>
<P>
   Word from Saudi Arabia is that Godolphin Stable's China Visit is
being pointed toward this year's Run for the Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Godolphin racing manager Simon Crisford told The Associated
Press that the Makhtoum family is hoping that Chief Seattle, second
to Anees in last November's Breeders' Cup Juvenile, will also make
the race.
</P>
<P>
   China Visit won the first United Arab Emirates Derby at Dubai on
March 25 in only his second career start, beating Bachir by 4 1/4
lengths in the one-mile race on dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Seattle has not raced this year, but according to Crisford
he may run in a Dubai trial race to prepare for the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   One question comes to mind -- if, as Crisford maintains, the
sheiks are so eager to win the Derby, why don't they bring their
horses to the U.S. a little sooner and give them some real prep
races?
</P>
<P>
   Did they ever hear of the Wood Memorial or Blue Grass Stakes?
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) According to the Japanese newspaper Sports Nippon,
30-year-old jockey Yutaka Take will leave Japan and ride in the
U.S. for a year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Take will relocate to the West Coast in
June and begin riding at Hollywood Park, Del Mar and Santa Anita.
While in the U.S., he will also occasionally ride in Japan and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Take (pronounced TAH-kay) has been Japan's leading rider since
1987 when he became a teen idol. The jockey has won every major
race in the country, and last November captured Japan's most
important international race when he rode Special Week to victory
in the Grade I Japan Cup.

   NEW YORK _ There were two people Derek Bell had to acknowledge
after he crossed home plate Monday. One was his mother, who was in
the stands, and the other was his pitcher, who was at the front of
a pack of Mets swarming to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   Bell had just ripped Donne Wall's first pitch over the wall in
left-center field, breaking a tie in the bottom of the eighth
inning and sending the Mets to a 2-1 victory over the San Diego
Padres in their Shea Stadium opener. His home run made the starter
Al Leiter, who had been removed for a pinch-hitter earlier in the
inning, the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that was for him, for keeping us close,'' Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other new addition to the Mets' starting lineup, first
baseman Todd Zeile, drove in the Mets' other run with a sacrifice
fly in the seventh inning. Armando Benitez, who opens the season as
the Mets' closer after beginning last year as a setup man, pitched
a 1-2-3 ninth for his first save, delighting the soldout crowd of
52,308.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Padres left-hander Sterling Hitchcock, the Mets were
able to get only one runner past first base through the first six
innings _ Zeile, who was stranded after a leadoff double in the
second. Leiter, who stayed behind during the Mets' season-opening
two-game split with the Chicago Cubs in Japan last week, thought
his teammates might have been sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept hearing a little grumbling that I'd better do good,
because a lot of our guys were tired,'' Leiter said, smiling.
``Especially with the way Sterling was throwing. I know our guys
have that jet-lag thing, and he was throwing the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock spotted his fastball well and used his changeup
effectively, coming inside with it and surprising the Mets by using
it with a full count. Wall relieved him in the seventh inning,
striking out Darryl Hamilton and Rey Ordonez to snuff a Mets rally
after they had tied the score, and he got two quick outs in the
eighth. Then Bell connected, and Leiter was rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Few players on the Mets draw as much attention to themselves off
the field as Bell, whose garish clothes and jewelry suggest
self-promotion. But the Mets are finding that Bell, who was
acquired from Houston in the Mike Hampton trade in December, is
much more aware of his teammates than it seems. Pointing at Leiter
as he celebrated his home run emphasized that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek can come across as a little goofy and not always
thinking at times,'' said Leiter, who allowed five hits in eight
innings, ``but believe it or not, having talked to him about
baseball and pitching, and what he thinks about hitting, he's a
very knowledgeable player. Just for him to make reference to that,
he knew what was going through my mind at the time, and I
appreciated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter stood to be the losing pitcher for much of the game,
having given up a solo home run in the second inning to third
baseman Phil Nevin, who had three of the Padres' five hits. But he
was masterful otherwise, allowing only one hit in 10 at-bats with
runners on base, striking out seven and walking none.
</P>
<P>
   His outing was similar to Rick Reed's in the second game in
Tokyo. Reed allowed four hits and one run in eight innings that
game, but left with a no-decision as the Mets won in 11 innings on
Benny Agbayani's pinch-hit grand slam. The Mets are hitting only
.177 through three games, but it has not mattered much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not scoring bunches of runs right now,'' catcher Mike
Piazza said. ``But if we're able to get that pitching, we're going
to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who flied out to the warning track in his first at-bat,
singled to deep left field in the seventh, allowing Edgardo Alfonzo
to go from first to third. Alfonzo had led off the inning with a
walk, only the second surrendered by Hitchcock, and when Zeile
followed Piazza to the plate with runners at the corners and no one
out, he got ahead in the count, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets lost John Olerud as a free agent last winter,
they turned to Zeile, who played third base for Texas last year.
One thing that appeals to the Mets is that, while Zeile sees a lot
of pitches, he is more inclined to swing when he is ahead in the
count, rather than wait for a walk, and the Mets believe he can
drive in 100 runs with that approach.
</P>
<P>
   So it was Monday. Zeile said he was anxious at the plate in
Japan, where he was 1 for 7, but he relaxed Monday, letting
Hitchcock fall behind in the seventh before taking an aggressive
approach and driving the sacrifice fly to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile was sitting on the bench next to Piazza when Bell hit his
home run in the eighth. Moments before, Piazza predicted that Bell
would hit one out. Piazza and Zeile looked at each other, and
Piazza joked that he deserved all the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really clairvoyant or anything,'' said Piazza, who
nevertheless added that eight of his 10 predictions last year came
true. ``I just had a feeling. It's just one of those things _ you
have to have that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are feeling good about themselves now, thanks in part
to the heroics of Bell, who entered this season as the least-known
quantity in the regular lineup. Bell hit .236 last year, lowest in
the National League among those who qualified for the batting
title, but he has been productive in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The productive Derek Bell _ the one who batted .314 in 1998 _ is
the hitter Mets Manager Bobby Valentine is counting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a good player,'' Valentine said. ``I've have
really good images of him in my mind for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's image was the most memorable of all.

 &HT;    Key players in the Microsoft antitrust case
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Penfield Jackson, U.S. district judge
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 63, found last November that Microsoft dominates the
market for personal computer operating systems and uses its
monopolistic power to squash competition and stifle innovation. On
Monday, the judge declared the company broke the law. Jackson was
appointed in 1982 by President Reagan. During the trial, he
occasionally lost his temper toward witnesses and lawyers and
openly laughed at videotape of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates'
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Posner, mediator
</P>
<P>
   Posner, 60, was asked late last year to help Microsoft and the
Justice Department reach an out-of-court settlement. The
Chicago-based federal judge graduated with a degree in English from
Yale University in 1959 and finished first in his class at Harvard
Law School in 1962. After teaching law for a year at Stanford
University, he came to the University of Chicago, where he taught
at the law school until being named to the bench in 1981 by Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman
</P>
<P>
   Gates, 44, is the world's richest person, worth an estimated
$71.5 billion. He co-founded Microsoft in 1975 after dropping out
of Harvard. By 1991, the vast majority of world's personal
computers relied on Microsoft's operating system. He chose not to
appear in person as a witness in the antitrust trial, though he has
testified in other courtroom proceedings. In his videotaped
deposition for the current trial, he jousted with government
lawyers over almost every question, appearing evasive when he said
he forgot about key events and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive officer
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, 43, a classmate of Gates' at Harvard University, is
ranked by Forbes magazine as the fourth-richest American, on the
strength of his 5 percent stake in Microsoft. Ballmer joined the
company in 1980. He was made president in 1998 and succeeded Gates
as chief executive in January. Ballmer has been adamant in speaking
out against any settlement of the antitrust case that would result
in the company's breakup.
</P>
<P>
   David Boies, Justice Department lawyer
</P>
<P>
   Boies, 58, wore the same blue tie nearly every day of the trial.
He came into the case without a great grasp of computer technology
but later competently questioned witnesses about technically arcane
subjects like Java programming language. He appeared to favor
asking Microsoft witnesses seemingly innocent questions, then
confronting them with e-mails or other documents _ often written by
themselves _ that appear to contradict their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Joel I. Klein, assistant attorney general, Antitrust Division
</P>
<P>
   When Klein, 53, was nominated by President Clinton as the
Justice Department's antitrust chief, some senators considered him
too soft. So it's somewhat ironic that Klein is now widely viewed
as an aggressive, even zealous, champion of antitrust enforcement,
a reputation cemented by his challenge to Microsoft. Klein was
appointed assistant attorney general for the antitrust division in
October 1996

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is 34, six months behind on the rent and last week
had to borrow $200 from his father, a farmer in Spain. Conventional
wisdom would suggest that Miguel Adrover get a job, but to the
cockeyed fashion world, which can forgive anything except a
mediocre talent, Adrover's creative gifts are apparently as good as
money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday afternoon, the fledgling designer, who was hailed a
star after only his second show, in February, at the New York fall
collections, was in his apartment on East Third Street. Like his
clothes _ which are made largely from donated fabrics and things he
can buy cheaply on the street, like baseball caps and sweat shirts,
and which he stays up nights rubbing with sandpaper until they look
old _ the apartment shows just how far a person can go on nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The place consists of two small rooms in the basement, although
that probably makes it sound like a cozy garden apartment.
Actually, to get to Adrover's apartment, one must go down a long
grimy passageway that reeks of every imaginable New York smell. One
can only hope that Adrover's door is open, throwing out a weak
yellow shaft of light, because, on top of everything else, it is
too dark to see.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Adrover has a couch, a couple of old chairs and a table
stacked with magazines and press clippings about himself. He has a
phone in there, and when it rang, about every 15 minutes, Jennefer
Hoffman, an artist who has been helping Adrover, picked it up and
said brightly, ``Studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was funny, since nothing about the place _ not the weak
yellow light, not the lumpy brown sofa, not the stuffed deer head
lying over in one corner _ said studio.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Adrover has a curious effect on people, which is, they want
to give him money. Jeffrey Kalinsky, who has Jeffrey boutiques on
14th Street and in Atlanta, said last week that he would be willing
to give Adrover $25,000 to help get his fall collection
manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done that in my life with a designer,'' Kalinsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   This past January, Linda Dresner, who has stores with her name
on Park Avenue and in Birmingham, Mich., visited Adrover in his
apartment with Catherine Dietlein, an independent scout for
retailers. There were five people crammed in there working on the
fall collection. ``And smoke!'' Dresner recalled. ``I said, `Open
the door, dear.''' Adrover was hanging the finished samples over
his bed and sleeping under them at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole scene was so sincere,'' Dresner continued. ``I mean,
I wrote a check _ that's how I felt. He has something to say with
his clothes that nobody else is saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Gilhart, a vice president for women's fashion at Barneys
New York, isn't in a position to write a check, but she said
flatly, ``If Miguel just wants to make some clothes for us, we'll
take them.'' She has called him every few days for the past month,
``just to see what's up,'' she said, and added: ``He's what they
call in Texas a wildcatter. He's larger than life, and just
brimming with ideas and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Adrover's days of living on sandwiches and
selling a sample here and there to get by (he recently sold one
from his spring 2000 collection to Sarah Jessica Parker for $300)
may be numbered. Although he couldn't give specifics because of
confidentiality agreements, he is close to working out a production
deal with the recently formed Pegasus Apparel Group.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ruzow, a former Donna Karan executive who was named
chairman and chief executive of the group just last Friday,
confirmed that talks were under way with Adrover, but also declined
to elaborate. Pegasus Apparel Group is an interesting story in
itself. Formed as a holding company less than a month ago, it is
one of two $800 million private equity funds controlled by its
principals. The group, which has plans to invest broadly in
so-called lifestyle categories like fashion and cosmetics, has
already announced a financing deal with the designer Pamela Dennis.
Similar agreements are said to be in the works with Daryl Kerrigan
and Cynthia Rowley.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the group was officially formed, intermediaries were
making contact with Adrover less than 48 hours after his February
show. As Ruzow said, ``there's a great deal of commercially viable
product there.'' Presuming Adrover gets financing, it's still
uncertain whether his fall collection can be delivered to stores in
time. Barneys, Linda Dresner, Neiman Marcus, Jeffrey and others
have all expressed interest in the line.
</P>
<P>
   Although Adrover, who grew up on his family's almond farm on
Majorca, is untrained and has operated on a shoestring, he is
nothing if not resourceful. For several years he and a friend,
Douglas Hobbes, ran a small downtown boutique called Horn that
attracted a word-of-mouth following. Then last September, as if via
the same East Village underground, word got out that Adrover was
staging his first show, and that Alexander McQueen would be there.
That show, which included a much-photographed miniskirt salvaged
from an old Louis Vuitton bag and dresses cleverly patched with
newspaper (a foreshadowing of John Galliano's Dior show?), cost
about $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   By February, Adrover had become the most talked-about newcomer
since _well, since nobody can recall. Not even the buzz around
Isaac Mizrahi in the late 1980s is comparable, because, unlike
Mizrahi, who had ties to the fashion establishment, Adrover seemed
to come out of nowhere. What's more, his fall collection showed a
substantial leap forward (helped by Mei Zou, a seamstress who
worked for Adrover during her off hours, and Sebastian Pons, a
childhood friend, who has been an assistant to McQueen, along with
others). Not only were the clothes sophisticated, with tailored
suits and ladylike blouses, there were also witty takes on luxury
labels like Hermes and Burberry.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Adrover has been waiting for the rest of his life to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all these magazines stacked around here,'' he said
last week in his basement rooms. ``I'm everywhere, in pages and
pages. I'm invited to parties. And I think, `This is me, living
here.''' He shook his head and grinned as he said, ``It's really
weird.''
</P>
<P>
   If Adrover senses the paradox of his situation, he is not
unmindful of the stakes, or risks, involved with being a hot new
property. He said he had no interest in trying to build his
business slowly on his own, the way designers used to, or in
accepting a one-shot infusion of cash. ``I need to pay the people
around me salaries,'' he said, ``and I don't want to struggle from
one day to the next to eat. It's really sad, because in this
business if you don't have the infrastructure, you can never make
it. No matter how good you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion is an essentially optimistic undertaking. Why else would
anyone go into a business whose motto could read: ``Whatever
happened to ...?'' As Ruzzo said, ``It's survival of the fittest.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Adrover seems to have an instinct for survival. It's
almost as if he doesn't know what he can do because he's never
bothered to ask what he  &UR; can't &LR;  do. Make a ravishing mulberry coat
with a cheeky back of Vuitton vinyl? Why not? Pump up the shoulders
of a sweatshirt by fitting them with baseball caps? Of course!
</P>
<P>
   Adrover has so many ideas that when he was told that a prominent
magazine editor had said his fall show needed more editing, he
looked nonplused.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's editing?'' he asked Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's when you make things more focused,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Adrover frowned: ``Focused on what?''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman smiled indulgently as if talking to a child. ``Just keep
thinking that way,'' she said.
</P>

BUSH UNVEILS PLAN TO MAKE CLEANUP OF POLLUTED SITES EASIER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALIQUIPPA, Pa. _ Presidential hopeful George W. Bush defended
his environmental record as Texas governor Monday and unveiled a
plan to spur cleanup of the nation's polluted industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our state, like Pennsylvania, didn't wait for Al Gore to wave
his magic wand and clean up our environment. We cleaned it up
ourselves, and our states are better off for it,'' said Bush, who
signaled he would go after his Democratic opponent on an issue
considered one of Gore's strong suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to say, 'I'm an environmentalist,''' he said.
``It's another to point to a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, said he is
looking forward to debating Gore on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush toured a US Gypsum wallboard factory under construction on
the grounds of the former J&AMP;L Steel Mill, a site that is among more
than 600 so-called ``brownfields'' Pennsylvania has cleaned up and
reclaimed. The new factory, set to open this summer, will employ
more than 150 people in this depressed steel town near Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, accompanied by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, told
construction workers at the site that if elected president, he'll
bring ``common-sense reform'' to brownfields cleanups.
</P>
<P>
   He announced a six-point plan in which he would direct the
Environmental Protection Agency to set cleanup standards with more
flexibility than the current Superfund standards, protect companies
from federal liability if they clean the sites properly, and focus
the efforts of the federal government on developing new cleanup
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   His plan would provide block grants to states through a
brownfield cleanup loan fund, and would make permanent the current
tax incentives for cleaning up the sites. He also would hold the
federal government, which he called the country's worst polluter,
accountable for cleaning up its own messes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What counts is what you do,'' he told the workers, ``not what
you promise.``
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman responded to Bush's proposal by questioning the
Texas governor's sincerity, saying Bush surrendered environmental
protection in Texas to the wishes of his campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of whitewashing can cover up Bush's record,'' Gore
spokesman Doug Hattaway said. ``He allowed his special interest
friends to help weaken environmental laws and on his watch Texas is
now the most polluted state in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said state Superfund spending,(the longtime national
toxic site cleanup program) was cut from $44 million to $22 million
in Texas for fiscal years 1997-98. He also criticized a Bush
program, written with input by industry, that allows some
grandfathered air polluting plants to voluntarily come into
compliance with the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush became governor in 1995, Texas has cleaned up 451
brownfield sites and is working on more than 500. Bush said that
was possible because of legislation he pushed through to allow
local governments to give property tax incentives for the cleanups.
The new laws also protect future owners and developers from
liability for past contamination if they meet reasonable standards
for cleaning up the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said 450,000 brownfields across the country have been
abandoned by polluters and shunned by other companies that fear
being sued for the environmental harm caused by former owners.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the federal government's rigid environmental
regulations, especially under the Superfund cleanup program, for
the lack of progress in cleaning up the sites, and for the sprawl
created when companies use up the land and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old system of mandate, regulate and litigate only sends
potential developers off in search of greener pastures,
literally,'' he said. ``Brownfields get passed over, while
greenfields get paved over.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he intends to combat Gore's expertise on the
environment, and his endorsements by national environmental
organizations, Bush poked fun at the Democratic candidate's book,
``Earth in the Balance,'' and said Gore might have to explain some
of his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he has written on the subject,'' he said. ``I think
that's the book that said we would get rid of automobile engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between rhetoric and reality. I happen to
believe that job growth can coexist with good environmental
policy,'' he said, ``and I know that the command and control policy
of Washington won't work.``
</P>
<P>
   Gore's approach, and the approach of the Superfund cleanup
program he helped create, is based on the philosophy that ``we can
sue our way to clean air,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sue our way to clean air. In fact the threat of
lawsuits makes it more difficult to meet reasonable standards when
it comes to cleaning up industrial sites,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that when Superfund was established in 1980, the plan
was to clean up some of the country's worst toxic sites in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years later, the job isn't done,'' he said. ``Less than
half of the Superfund sites have been cleaned up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also defended himself against the Gore campaign's
contention that his allegiance to big business in Texas has led to
the state's status among the worst air and water polluters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may say that, but this is a man who will say anything to
get elected. Remember who I'm running against,'' he said.
``Industrial pollution is down in my state since I've been
governor. I've got a good record.``

ADVERTISING: COKE TO DISBAND ITS IN-HOUSE AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another sign of how extensively Coca-Cola plans to overhaul
the sales and marketing of its soft drinks, the company will
disband the unconventional in-house advertising agency that has led
the way in creating campaigns for its flagship brand.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to close Edge Creative, the upstart agency that has
had Coca-Cola as its sole client since 1991, and to reassign its
responsibilities to traditional Madison Avenue shops is indicative
of the significant shifts the company is making in response to
pressure from competitors and investors.
</P>
<P>
   At a much-anticipated meeting with Wall Street analysts in New
York Tuesday, Coca-Cola intends to outline details of its makeover
and make a slight revision downward of its estimates for soft-drink
growth, which have long been deemed overly optimistic in the face
of challenges from other beverages like tea, water and juice
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug Daft is basically out to recreate the company with
changes that are broad based and widespread,'' said John D. Sicher,
editor and publisher of Beverage Digest in Bedford Hills, N.Y., an
industry newsletter that has closely followed the Coca-Cola
revamping under Douglas N. Daft, the new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes are as significant or more significant than any
Coca-Cola has gone through in decades,'' Sicher said. ``A year or
two from now, it will be a very different company.''
</P>
<P>
   Edge Creative was a groundbreaking alliance of Coca-Cola, the
world's largest soft-drink marketer, and Michael Ovitz, who had
been chairman of the powerful Hollywood talent agency, the Creative
Artists Agency. The goal of the joint venture _ best known for
producing the ``Always Coca-Cola'' campaign that ran from 1993 to
1999 and inventing the popular polar bear characters _ was to shake
up the sales pitches for the best-selling Coca-Cola brand, known as
Coca-Cola Classic in North America and Coca-Cola elsewhere around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue was stunned in 1992 when Edge Creative won the
creative oversight of the flagship brand from a mainstream ad
agency, McCann-Erickson Worldwide, a unit of the mighty Interpublic
Group of Cos. that had handled that assignment for almost 40 years.
There was widespread speculation the shift would influence other
giant marketers to look beyond the rosters of their traditional
agencies in seeking different ways to peddle familiar consumer
products.
</P>
<P>
   While virtually no other big advertisers followed Coca-Cola in
redefining the usual agency-client relationship, marketers in
general are now far more willing to entertain concepts from other
sources, ranging from consulting companies to Web site developers
to specialists in tasks like direct marketing and sales promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model of having fresh creative resources looking at a big
brand like Coke will continue,'' said Ian Rowden, who oversees
advertising for the company from Atlanta with the title of vice
president for consumer communications in the Coca-Cola marketing
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really pleased with what we did, making two or three
hundred ads together,'' Rowden said. ``We had highs and lows along
the way, as you always do with ads, but it enabled us to get a
fresh perspective on the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowden and the three principals of Edge Creative, in separate
telephone interviews, attributed the agency's closing, as of May 1,
to a decision by the principals to tackle what they described as
new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this would last a couple years and it's lasted
eight,'' said Shelly Hochron, a principal at Edge Creative in Santa
Monica, Calif. ``All in all, it was a good relationship, but it's
time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the group that ate Madison Avenue,'' she added.
``I heard the criticisms, but Coke had a need for a spark of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   The substantive reorganization of Coca-Cola under Daft _
including a decentralization of the operational and marketing
functions to give local managers more authority, the elimination of
6,000 jobs and the closing of the company's retail outlets _ seemed
to inspire the Edge Creative executives to rethink their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see all these changes going on around you and it's a
trigger,'' said Jack Harrower, the second principal, who is married
to Hochron. ``You feel you need to branch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Edge Creative began as a division of Creative Artists. When
Ovitz left the talent agency to join Walt Disney Co. in 1995, the
Coke account followed, as did Hochron, Harrower and the third
partner, Len Fink. The abrupt departure of Ovitz from Disney did
not affect the Coca-Cola ties with Edge Creative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were partners with Coca-Cola in a way like none I've ever
seen, and it has been a fabulous ride,'' Fink said. ``It was much
more successful than I ever imagined in the beginning it would be,
but at this point we need to explore other things.''
</P>
<P>
   The three Edge Creative principals declined to discuss
specifically what they might do next, but all have worked for
Madison Avenue agencies in the past, and Fink was an early advocate
of high technology and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sicher of Beverage Digest agreed that the Edge Creative work _
which carried the ``Always Coca-Cola'' theme until January, when a
campaign called ``Coca-Cola. Enjoy'' was introduced _ was
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a time when the cola segment of the soft drink market
was struggling to grow, Coke Classic grew a tiny bit,'' Sicher
said, to 20.3 percent of soft-drink sales in 1999 from 20.2 percent
in 1993. By comparison, he added, the market share of the main Coke
Classic rival, the Pepsi-Cola brand sold by PepsiCo, declined to
13.8 percent last year from 15.7 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ```Always' maybe outlived its usefulness by a year and many
bottlers wanted a new campaign,'' Sicher said. ``But during the
years the campaign ran, Coke Classic outperformed the cola segment
and the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to assess the performance of the replacement
campaign, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The production of the initial spate of ``Enjoy'' ads is being
shared by Edge Creative with a traditional agency on the Coca-Cola
roster, the Leo Burnett unit of the B Com3 Group. With Edge
Creative closing, Rowden said, ideas for the next round of ads for
the flagship brand, scheduled for the summer, will be considered
from Burnett and the six other Madison Avenue shops that have
contributed commercials for that product in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The other six agencies are: Bartle Bogle Hegarty, which is 49
percent owned by B Com3 ; D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles, wholly
owned by B Com3 ; Doner in Southfield, Mich.; McCann-Erickson;
Publicis; and Wieden &AMP; Kennedy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm going to look at the roster,'' Rowden said, ``to make
sure we have the right resources for the brand. As a result, we may
or may not add additional Madison Avenue agencies.'' In the
meantime, the current Coke shops are working on localized and
specialized tasks like ads for Australia by McCann-Erickson, ads
for Europe by Publicis, ads for Hong Kong by D'Arcy and a Summer
Olympics campaign by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important as the additional cases of Coke Classic that
``Enjoy'' may sell is the efforts that Coca-Cola will make under
Daft to improve its corporate image, which has been tarnished by a
series of problems. They include extensive product recalls last
summer in parts of Europe; a steep tumble in the price of Coca-Cola
stock; a generous severance package for Daft's predecessor, M.
Douglas Ivester; and a lawsuit filed nearly a year ago by black
employees of Coca-Cola in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Among those working to convince the company to resolve that
lawsuit is the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who met in Atlanta last week
with Daft and other senior Coca-Cola executives.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Ivester's ``golden parachute,'' Jackson said, which
totaled an estimated $120 million, ``turned lights and siren sounds
on'' among the plaintiffs.

COURT REFUSES TO LET WOMAN IMPLANT FROZEN EMBRYOS OVER HUSBAND'S
OBJECTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The highest court in Massachusetts, ruling in a case
that pitted a woman who wanted to implant frozen embryos in her
womb versus her ex-husband who wanted no more children with her,
has come down firmly on the ex-husband's side, saying that no one
should be forced to become a parent.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion, issued Friday, is expected to influence court
decisions around the country in a nascent area of the law: how to
treat high-tech baby-making, and in particular, how to decide the
fates of frozen embryos when the couples who have made them in the
course of fertility treatments later separate or divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Such cases have reached three state supreme courts, are pending
in a half-dozen other states and are likely to become more common
as the numbers of frozen embryos, now estimated at about 150,000,
increase.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts case, a woman identified in court papers
only as B.Z., wanted to try one last time, at age 44, to become
pregnant using the four frozen embryos left from her years of
fertility treatments. Her ex-husband, identified as A.Z., objected,
even though his ex-wife had seven consent forms he had signed over
the years saying that if the couple separated, the embryos would
revert to her for implantation.
</P>
<P>
   A family court had ruled in favor of the ex-husband, saying, in
part, that because the couple had had twins and divorced since the
agreement, circumstances had changed too much for him to be held to
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Judicial Court, in a ruling it made in February
but only now backed up with a detailed opinion, has taken a big
step further. The consent forms, it said, had some problems, but
``Even had the husband and wife entered into an unambiguous
agreement between themselves regarding the disposition of the
frozen pre-embryos, we would not enforce an agreement that would
compel one donor to become a parent against his or her will. As a
matter of public policy, we conclude that forced procreation is not
an area amenable to judicial enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by Justice Judith Cowin said that ``respect for
liberty and privacy requires that individuals be accorded the
freedom to decide whether to enter into a family relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In similar cases, state courts have tended to rule that whenever
possible, the agreement a couple had signed with a fertility clinic
about what to do with their embryos in the event of a divorce or
death should be considered a contract. A few legislatures have
considered or passed laws requiring such agreements. But the
Massachusetts ruling, experts say, indicates that such a contract
is far from iron-clad.
</P>
<P>
   Couples ``cannot assume that one or the other can use the frozen
embryos in the event of a divorce in Massachusetts or any court
jurisdiction that follows Massachusetts,'' said Susan L. Crockin, a
lawyer here specializing in reproductive technology. ``This court
has made it absolutely clear that there is no agreement, no matter
how clearly understood and entered into, that is going to bind a
subsequently objecting partner, and programs need to make that
clear to patients now starting the process, as well as to patients
who have embryos frozen. The prior agreements are out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Van Ness, the lawyer for B.Z., said that she has not
decided whether to appeal the ruling. Previous courts, she said,
had seemed to lean toward the ``vetoer,'' the partner who did not
want the embryos brought to term. But if ever a case seemed to
support favoring the partner who wanted children, she added, this
one did, because the woman had relied on her husband's promises and
found time running out when he objected to her use of the embryos.
The woman's clinic would implant embryos in women only until age
45.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court says, `We're not going to force procreation on
someone,' but by making that decision, they've forced my client not
to procreate,'' Van Ness said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using the power of the state to prevent my client from
using the embryos that she suffered and almost died to create,''
she said, referring to ectopic pregnancies and other complications
B.Z. suffered.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Also, Van Ness noted, the husband had participated voluntarily
in fertility treatments for years, demonstrating more intent to
procreate than simply having sex, and the courts have consistently
held men responsible for children they produce through sex. Yet
because the embryos exist outside her client's body, she said,
``the court has set up a different rule.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Crockin said the fact that an embryo is in a freezer vial rather
than in a womb makes a great difference. ``The court is not
balancing the constitutional rights of a pregnant woman against a
partner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Paula H. Noe, a lawyer who represented the husband in family
court, said: ``What I think the court is saying is that absent a
pregnancy, which weighs things differently, we have individual
rights called privacy rights, that must be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a man and a woman who are potential parents,'' Noe
said, ``and no one has the upper hand; their privacy rights are
equal, and I think that's right on.''

 &HT;    Caution boils up in tech sector
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bargain-hunting usually follows a steep plunge in
stock prices. But many analysts warn against early shopping among
technology stocks despite the Microsoft-led damage in that sector
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which includes Microsoft and most
other high-tech stocks, fell 349.15 points, or 7.6 percent. The
percentage loss was the biggest since a tumble of 8.6 percent on
Aug. 31, 1998, in the midst of the Asian currency crisis. The point
drop, however, easily exceeded the earlier record of 229.46 points,
set Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Securities strategist Larry Wachtel said today's
market ``will likely see the extension of the tech decline.''
</P>
<P>
   At Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta, senior strategist Robert S.
Robbins, who had lowered his technology allocation recommendation
to 43 percent from 48 percent Friday, lowered it again Monday to 38
percent of total stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   A further decline today would push the Nasdaq composite close to
a bear market level for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   At 4,223.68, the Nasdaq is just over 16 percent below its
all-time high of 5,048.62, set March 10. Wall Street generally
regards a 10 percent decline in an index as a correction, while a
drop of 20 percent is a bear market. The Nasdaq fell almost 31
percent in the last bear market during the summer of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best-performing stocks of the first three months of
2000 suffered miserable losses Monday. They included Applied Micro
Circuits, Juniper Networks and Rambus, the best-performing stock in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As new economy stocks sank, old economy blue chips continued to
rise as investors were drawn to values in beaten-down shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 300.01 points, or 2.8
percent, to 11,221.93, and would have gone higher except for the
decline of Microsoft, a Dow stock.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dow gainers included Wal-Mart Stores, J.P. Morgan, Merck,
Philip Morris, DuPont and Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the caution expressed by some analysts, Brian Goodstadt
at Standard &AMP; Poor's reiterated a ``buy'' rating on Microsoft
because he said the ``worse case scenario'' is already factored in
the share price.
</P>
<P>
   Goodstadt argued that the most damaging aspect of the federal
court's ruling Monday is that it opens the door to more civil
lawsuits against Microsoft. Other analysts think the company will
appeal the ruling. That process could take years, with Microsoft
continuing to make money throughout.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Microsoft stock, which fell $15.37 1/2 to $90.87 1/2 in
regular-hours trading, was reported trading higher in the
after-hours session.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft was blamed as the trigger for Monday's Nasdaq
sell-off, analysts said it was not the only reason, since the stock
accounts for only about 8.5 percent of the index's value.
Robinson-Humphrey's Robbins noted that the Morgan Stanley
technology index had advanced more than 96 percent in the six
months that ended with the Nasdaq's recent high, creating a
situation where ``profit taking is very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the market's attention focused on the technology slide
Monday, most traders overlooked the usually important manufacturing
report from the National Association of Purchasing Management.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's March index dipped to 55.8 percent from 56.9
percent in February, but it was still well above the reading of 50
percent that indicates growth.
</P>
<P>
   The price component jumped to 79.8 percent from 74.1 percent,
the highest level since February 1995. In a normal session, that
probably would have been treated as another inflation threat
leading to higher interest rates by the Federal Reserve.

GORE DENOUNCES DISPARITIES IN MINORITY ACCESS TO COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Speaking at the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s alma
mater on the eve of the anniversary of his death, Vice President Al
Gore called Monday for programs to narrow the ``digital divide''
that has left minorities with unequal access to computers and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, referred
repeatedly to the famous final speech that King delivered 32 years
ago Monday night, when the civil rights leader declared that he had
been to the mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take this mountaintop moment,'' he told about 500
students at Morehouse College, ``and squander the resources that we
call the surplus on a tax cut for the wealthy, on a risk that is
designed not to lift up those that are in need, but to give more to
those who have much, what will happen to those that are waiting for
the help that ought to be extended to them?''
</P>
<P>
   The want ads, Gore continued, are filled with high-paying jobs
that cannot be filled because of inadequate training. ``And
simultaneously,'' he said, ``we have hundreds of thousands and
millions who have the ability, the curiosity, the desire to learn
and to succeed but have not had the opportunity and the access.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, Gore said, will come from government financing to
place computers with Internet access in every classroom and
library, to train teachers in new technologies, to integrate
computers into the full scholastic curriculum, to build computer
learning centers in needy communities and to bring Internet access
to every household. He said the country should set a national goal
of making every student computer literate by the eighth grade. He
did not disclose a price for his recommendations, many of which
have already been proposed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In maintaining his campaign's focus on education, Gore has
spoken on this topic several times. But by doing so at Morehouse,
one of the country's elite black private colleges, he again
underscored the importance of black voters to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls show that Bush is a solid favorite across the
South, the Gore campaign believes it can break the Bush
stranglehold in selected states with the help of a heavy turnout of
loyal black Democrats. One of those states is Georgia, which the
Democratic ticket won narrowly in 1992 and lost narrowly in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapel named for King, Gore shared the stage Monday with
one of King's top lieutenants, Andrew Young, former mayor of
Atlanta, and with King's eldest son, Martin Luther King 3rd, now
the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Gore
also made a point of introducing his campaign manager, Donna
Brazille, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Gore echoed government officials who fear that
the computer divide may soon exacerbate existing racial disparities
in education, employment and income. A variety of recent studies
have shown that while Internet access is expanding rapidly,
persistent gaps remain in access based on income, race, education
level and region.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department study released last summer found that
households with incomes of $75,000 and higher were 20 times more
likely to have access to the Internet than those at the lowest
income levels, and more than nine times as likely to own a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Though disparities have narrowed in recent years among high
earners, the study found racial gaps that could not be explained by
differences in income alone. Among households with earnings from
$15,000 to $35,000, for instance, more than 32 percent of white
families owned computers, compared to only 19 percent of black and
Hispanic families. Seventeen percent of white households had home
Internet access, compared to 8 percent of black and Hispanic
households.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the gap threatens to further the perception that
minorities are politically disenfranchised. ``This new technology
of the Internet and computer communication can close that digital
divide,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore also was the headline attraction at a expensive fund-raiser
here Monday night for the Democratic National Committee. With a
price tag of $50,000 a person, the event was expected to raise more
than $1.5 million for the committee, said Jenny Backus, the DNC's
press secretary. The committee can use the money to promote
Democratic themes and candidates, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The list of contributors included Anne Cox Chambers, the
chairwoman of Atlanta Newspapers Inc., which publishes The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, and Michael Coles, the Georgia cookie magnate
who has run unsuccessfully for Congress. Other contributors
included prominent Atlanta companies like Coca-Cola, United Parcel
Service and Bell South.

 &HT;    Phony antiques prompt damages
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A jury has awarded an Atlanta man nearly $1 million in
damages in connection with his purchase of hundreds of alleged
pre-Columbian artifacts, which an antiquities expert later
identified as elaborate fakes.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of more than a year, the buyer, Robert B.
Watson of Atlanta, purchased hundreds of Central American artifacts
_ including jade masks, pendants, carved statuettes, and stone ax
heads _ from Atlanta collector W. Edward Vaught Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Vaught and Enrique Vargas, a Costa Rican artifact dealer, have
in the past sold thousands of pre-Columbian artifacts to Atlanta
area collectors, including some pieces that are now owned by the
Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos museum officials have said they have no reason to doubt
the authenticity of pieces on display at the museum. But the
verdict clearly shows that despite international agreements
designed to halt the flow of illicit antiquities from Latin
America, active trade in such items is continuing. It also
underscores the fact that, in the antiquities market, forgery is
all but impossible for casual collectors to detect.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a week of testimony before Fulton County Superior Court
Judge Joel Fryer, it was not clear whether Vaught himself knew the
pieces were modern forgeries of ancient craftsmanship when he sold
them to Watson _ or whether he himself had been duped.
</P>
<P>
   The jury decided it didn't make any difference. The verdict
awarded on Thursday to Watson, the buyer, covered the $178,000 that
he had previously paid for artifacts _ and $750,000 in punitive
damages. Watson, meanwhile, must return the fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the authenticity of the artifacts did not become
an issue until Watson wrote $59,000 in bad checks in 1997 for his
final shipment. Vaught sued to collect his money, and Watson
countersued _ armed with reports from an artifact expert, who said
hundreds of the purchases had been ``fabricated by methods and
using devices common today.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gramly, an archaeologist with the Great Lakes Artifact
Repository in New York, told the jury that the supposed
2,000-year-old artifacts he examined actually had been made in
modern times ``with obvious intent to deceive'' unsuspecting
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Latin American countries forbid the export and
sale of pre-Columbian artifacts, market prices are so high that
many countries now have thriving cottage industries that turn out
replicas that often are buried or weathered for a brief time to
give them the appearance of great age.

ESCAPING FROM THE CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use on Sunday, April 9) 
(ms) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although travel with children is climbing steadily _ an increase
of 68 percent was reported by the Travel Industry Association
between 1988 and 1998 _ some people would rather not.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those are parents themselves. This is confirmed by
Calvert Roberts, general manager of Curtain Bluff in Antigua, where
children under 12 are not welcomed from Jan. 10 to March 10. ``We
get people who work hard _ doctors, lawyers, people from Wall
Street,'' Roberts said. ``They are coming for vacation then and
they want to get away from the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Other travelers just want to be someplace quiet, where shouts
are confined to the tennis match and outdoor tranquillity is not
disturbed by a child pursuing a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Hostility, while probably not publicly endorsed, also exists:
Watching an adult airline passenger whose seatback is being kicked
by an unrestrained child shows how this emotion is fostered.
Oblivious or arrogant parents who haul children who are too young
into adult settings like trendy restaurants or the theater augment
this part of the population.
</P>
<P>
   So, while ski resorts, individual entrepreneurs and unlikely
places like Las Vegas are looking at the demographic charts and
offering environments that accommodate families, others are
creating niches or, like Curtain Bluff, setting aside time periods
when adults can expect to be with other adults only. Avoiding
children depends to a large degree on how controlled the entry to
the environment is: On a plane, train or bus, it is likely to be
impossible. Cruise ships, however, present a controllable
situation. After complaints about the behavior, particularly
drunkenness, of teen-agers, some ship lines took steps. In 1997,
Carnival Cruise Lines instituted a policy of not accepting
reservations for passengers under 21 unless accompanied in their
cabins by someone 25 or older. Other lines have variations on this
approach. Three expensive lines, Seabourn, Silversea and Windstar,
share a policy: ``children under 12 not encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Cruises does not book passengers under 18. When the
first of its five vessels went into service in August 1998, said
Brad Ball, a spokesman, passengers could take their children. ``But
there was basically nothing for them to do, and I guess we had a
couple of unruly ones,'' Ball said, so about a year ago the line,
following passengers' suggestions, became adults-only.
</P>
<P>
   Adults can generally read the signals. Motels with promotions
featuring cartoon characters probably have pools where cannonballs
are the dive du jour. Inns furnished with antiques probably
discourage children. On the road, the designation ``family
restaurant'' tells its own tale, although often the sign indicates
that liquor is not served.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Zagat issues some separate nightlife guides,
and often includes ``romantic'' categories in general guides.
Although it's a clumsy way to decide, price may help; even
well-to-do parents may have enough sense to avoid spending a lot of
money on a child who wants only the roll and butter.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lawler of Lawrence, Kan., who admits to a child of her
own, recently wrote ``Child-Free Travel'' (Pilot Books, Greenport,
N.Y.), but cautiously subtitled it ``The Curmudgeon's Guide.''
Lawler has adopted a humorously cranky tone _ for example,
providing a list of ``resorts to approach with caution,'' because
children might be around. Her joke wears thin, but she compiled
some lists of places and activities that might provide leads to
those seeking tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Club Med, marking its 50th anniversary, has gone with the flow
on the issue of children in its long life. When it came to the
Western Hemisphere in 1968, it was a progenitor of the childless
resort. The picture of bikini-suited beautiful people, wearing the
beads that in those days bought drinks, became the slightly racy
image of Club Med vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, boys and girls met, settled down and had
children. Club Med followed, adding children's activities to some
villages; it opened the first Mini Club in Guadeloupe in 1974. In
the 70s, according to Edwina Arnold, a longtime spokeswoman for the
company, only 15 percent of bookings were for families, the rest
for couples or singles. By 1997, 40 percent were families, 30
percent couples and 30 singles. Today's singles scene has changed,
and Club Med focuses on single travelers in their 30s for whom
frenetic activity is unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   Right now on this side of the Atlantic, the organization has
three places reserved for adults over 18: Turkoise in the Turks and
Caicos Islands and Cancun and Playa Blanca, Mexico. Eight family
villages in the Western Hemisphere have kids' programs that allow
parents to enjoy themselves separately for part of each day, and at
seven others, children are welcomed but parents must care for them.
A fourth adults-only village will be created next winter at Club
Med's Copper Mountain ski area in Colorado; the former Marriott at
Crested Butte, which the Club just bought, will cater to families.
Partying On
</P>
<P>
   The old Club Med aura abides in some resorts, however. The
announcement of the opening last fall of Hedonism III, an
adults-only resort in Runaway Bay, Jamaica, said an earlier
Hedonism property ``has stuck successfully to its party-hearty
adults-only concept through the wave of politically correct virtue
which swept the 80s and 90s.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Hedonism II, opened in 1976 in Negril, Jamaica,
was buffeted by a wave of virtue in the go-go 80s and the dot-com
90s falls oddly on ears that have heard mutterings from adults who
resented having children even in the airport boarding line.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still plenty of rational people who want
environments where there are no children, places with an ambience
more lively than a Henry James villa while not necessarily equipped
with Hedonism's see-through Jacuzzis.
</P>
<P>
   Sandals is an adult-only (in fact couples-only) resort, but the
message is somewhat modulated. Gordon Stewart, the proprietor who
calls himself Butch, speaks of couples who have lost track of each
other through years of marriage and family. ``We have tried to
create an environment to allow people to focus on each other,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that his 10 Sandals resorts, which accept no one
under 18, were designed with nooks where people can get away from
others, in addition to diverse restaurants offering varied cuisines
to guests who don't want to leave the resort. He is ebullient about
the results. In a telephone interview from Providenciales, Turks
and Caicos, he said, ``I have so many letters from people whose
marriages we've saved!''
</P>
<P>
   Hedonism? Well, SuperClubs, the owner, has opened Boscobel Beach
near Ocho Rios in Jamaica, which it calls the Caribbean's only
``Super-inclusive resort for families.'' There are SuperNannies and
Kiddy Cocktail parties, but there is also a West Wing for those 18
and older.
</P>
<P>
   And Roberts at Curtain Bluff says that for 10 months of the
year, his resort welcomes children. ``We have to build our
clientele,'' he said. ``We are going to want those children when
they are adults.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The states of the South, long home to the nation's
poorest and worst-performing students, have desperately begun to
experiment with education theories and school reform plans in ways
that are drawing national attention.
</P>
<P>
   While experimentation is going on in a few states in other
regions, almost every Southern governor, Republican or Democrat, is
either hunting for new school money or trying combinations of
familiar and occasionally untested ideas for improving student
achievement. Some of the plans mix new spending for large state
education agencies and teacher salaries with conservative proposals
like vouchers and an end to teacher job protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Southern states have really been pushing the envelope,''
said Kathy Christie, who runs the information clearinghouse at the
Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit policy group based
in Denver. ``They may be low in achievement, on average, but they
have a number of high-quality proposals out there that may start to
change that in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky seemed to be speaking for the
entire South earlier this year when he informed state lawmakers of
his top four priorities: ``Education, education, education and
education.'' Not all his colleagues have been quite so wry about
it, but in virtually every statehouse in the South, the priorities
are essentially the same.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is about to become the first state in the country to
wipe out all job protection for teachers, a measure Gov. Roy Barnes
pushed through the state Legislature over the objections of teacher
organizations as a message that the world had changed. The end of
tenure is the most attention-getting element of Barnes' sweeping
education overhaul, approved last month, which mandates smaller
class sizes, bonuses for teachers in good schools and a new
education bureaucracy to monitor annual testing.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has been spending more than $70 million a year to
raise teacher salaries above the regional average and provide
scholarships for future teachers, and it has established a new
training institute for principals.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas approach begun in the early 1990s and enhanced by Gov.
George W. Bush has put a strong emphasis on testing, breaking new
ground in the close monitoring of low-income and minority students.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina _ hailed along with Texas in a 1998 study by the
National Education Goals Panel as having made among the largest
gains in reading and math scores in the first part of the 1990s _
is tightening the licensing of both new and experienced teachers.
At the same time, it is offering substantial bonuses for teachers
in high-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has pioneered a program to provide private-school
vouchers for students in poorly performing public schools. The
program was recently ruled unconstitutional by a state judge, but
the state is appealing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   As the region with the lowest per-capita income, the South has
always lagged the rest of the country in educational achievement,
burdened by its former reliance on low-skill jobs and the residue
of segregated school systems. Forty percent of Americans without
high school diplomas are in the South, twice the percentage of any
other region, according to the Southern Regional Education Board, a
cooperative compact to improve the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The South was slower than the rest of the country to begin its
school reform, and for all the recent years of innovation,
performance has just barely begun to move up. The Southeast is
still the lowest-ranking of the nation's four regions on the
federal government's National Assessment of Education Progress
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 states that belong to the regional board, only six
meet the national average for proficiency in fourth-grade reading
(although others have shown some improvement), and only three do so
in eighth-grade reading. In the Deep South, only North Carolina
meets the national proficiency averages for both grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lagged behind the rest of the country for so long that
there is a much greater receptivity to experimentation,'' said John
Dornan, executive director of the Public School Forum, a nonprofit
public policy group based in Raleigh, N.C. ``The states are trying
a lot of high-stakes programs, but we're just now starting to fight
our way up to average.''
</P>
<P>
   As in most states, the effort to improve public schools began in
the South with the dire warnings published 17 years ago in ``A
Nation at Risk,'' a federal commission's report attacking the
quality of American education, and was prodded by business leaders
who said the regional economy was at stake. But the South had much
further to go than the rest of the country. It spent less on
education than any other region, and had by far the largest number
of dropouts and failing students. Nowhere was the connection
between student poverty and school performance more evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't put importance in the state of public education
until the last few years,'' Barnes, of Georgia, said in an
interview last week, riffling through bulging folders of education
statistics. ``Because in the South you didn't have to. You had
manufacturing concerns _ kids could drop out in high school and go
to work at a mill. Well, the mills are no longer there; the mills
are in Mexico or Asia. The economy has changed, and we've got to
improve our standards or we won't have the smart people to fill
those jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Governors of the New South like Lamar Alexander in Tennessee and
Richard Riley in South Carolina first began talking like this in
the 1980s, trying to repair their states' reputations with the
first wave of school reforms like testing and improving teacher
quality. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, one of the earliest
and most successful education advocates among the governors, was
the founding chairman of the national standards board that
certifies teachers in their fields, and his state now leads the
nation in board-certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, particularly in the Deep South, moved more slowly,
but now it is no longer possible to be a Southern governor without
a similar agenda. In Mississippi, which has the nation's
lowest-performing schools, Gov. Ronnie Musgrove promised in his
inaugural address in January to find $286 million to raise teacher
salaries to the regional average over the next five years (although
he has not yet persuaded legislators).
</P>
<P>
   Next door, in Alabama, Gov. Donald Siegelman has also proposed
substantial raises for teachers, in exchange for making it easier
to dismiss them without a lengthy procedure. But after his plan for
a state lottery to support education failed last year, he said the
money would have to come out of the same pot used for higher
education, and now university administrators have come out against
the proposal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it is the South's wealthier states, like Georgia,
Florida and the Carolinas, that are setting the pace for
innovation. Georgia's plan, centering on school accountability, is
typical of what other Southern states are approving or considering,
and Barnes frankly admits that much of it was borrowed from North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia plan, passed overwhelmingly in the state Legislature
last month and set to be signed into law in a few weeks, is based
on annual tests in Grades one through 12 in reading, writing,
mathematics, science and social studies. If students meet the goals
set by a new state Office of Education Accountability, the teachers
in their school will get bonus pay. If students in a school fail
repeatedly, they will be allowed to move to a different school, and
teachers and administrators can be disciplined or dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, class sizes will be limited to 21 students in
first through third grade, down from the current maximum of 33; in
later grades, class sizes can grow to 28. School councils of
parents, teachers and business leaders will be set up to work with
principals.
</P>
<P>
   Any teacher dismissed will be given a written reason but will
not have the right to a hearing. Although a few other states have
shortened the hearing process, none of them have eliminated it
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The larger of two state teachers organizations, the Professional
Association of Georgia Educators, eventually dropped its opposition
when Barnes agreed that the dismissal rule would be applied only to
teachers hired from now on, not to existing faculty. But a smaller
teachers group, the Georgia Association of Educators, remains
opposed; its executive director, Drew Albritton, said the provision
would drive away good teachers by permitting arbitrary dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a Democrat who ran the risk of alienating a crucial
constituency of his party with the measure, acknowledged that there
was no statistical link between teacher tenure rights and student
achievement. But he said the move sent a message to educators that
change would be pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenure is an outdated concept,'' he said, ``born of a time
when we treasured process over performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's consensus is not always easy to come by, however,
especially in states that passed the first reform measures some
time ago and are now coming to realize that the costs only go up.
In Kentucky, which has seen steady improvement since passing a
school reform bill in 1990, legislators have been unable to agree
on Gov. Patton's proposal to pay for enhanced teacher training
programs. Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana has not been able to find
the $220 million he wants to raise teacher salaries to the
Southeastern average, and the state's teachers groups are murmuring
about an autumn strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've actually made a lot of progress, considering where we
were,'' said Mark Musick, president of the Southern Regional
Education Board. ``But we had a lot of room to make progress. The
next steps are going to be even harder.''

NATO TROOPS SEIZE A TOP SERB FACING WAR CRIME CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ After years of criticism for not
bringing top war criminals to justice, NATO troops Monday arrested
Momcilo Krajisnik, one of the most important Serb leaders in the
Bosnian war, on charges of war crimes, including genocide.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said in announcing the arrest that Krajisnik, a
close ally of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, was the
most senior of 39 war crime suspects now in custody. Diplomats have
described Krajisnik as a fanatic politician who sometimes equaled
Karadzic in power, and through his business deals helped finance
the ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign in the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik was immediately flown to The Hague where he will stand
trial before the International Tribunal, which charged him with
every war crime in its statute for his role as a principal
strategist behind hundreds of civilian massacres. Conviction would
mean a maximum life sentence for Krajisnik, 55, who is expected to
enter a plea this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although his impending indictment was reported in the Serbian
press three months before it was handed up secretly in February, it
was not clear why French troops with the SFOR peacekeeping force
decided to arrest him now.
</P>
<P>
   But given the long-running failure of NATO forces to bring war
criminals to trial, Krajisnik clearly was not expecting his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Krajisnik was at his elderly parents' home
in Pale when French troops knocked down the door shortly after 3
a.m. Monday. They locked his parents in a closet, hogtied his two
sons and hustled Krajisnik, still in his pajamas, onto a plane.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. representative at the
United Nations, said in an interview, ``This is possibly the most
important day since the Dayton agreement on Bosnia,'' adding that
``Krajisnik was a very important person after all. He was the
former co-president of Bosnia, he was the head of the Bosnia Serb
delegation at Dayton.'' Holbrooke was the author of the Dayton
peace accord on the Bosnian war in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The removal of Krajisnik from the country, which is long
overdue but couldn't happen until he was indicted, removes from
Bosnia the leading public opponent of the Dayton agreement. The
other opponent, Karadzic, has been in hiding for four years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor for the tribunal, Carla Del Ponte, said Monday
that Karadzic ``should stand trial jointly'' with Krajisnik. The
tribunal is clearly pressing NATO to make that trial a reality by
finally arresting Karadzic, indicted in 1995 on charges of
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's indictment against Krajisnik cataloged dozens of
destroyed villages and hundreds of massacres. It also listed 11
prison camps where non-Serbs were detained and tortured, executed
or deported under orders from Krajisnik and other top leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the war he was second only to Karadzic and shared command
over Bosnian military and police,'' said Paul Risley, the spokesman
for Del Ponte. ``The decisions he participated in, resulted in the
deaths of thousands of Bosnians and in the deportations and ethnic
cleansing of hundred of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on NATO to arrest key figures accused of genocide
in the Balkans has been growing since last spring, after Louise
Arbour, then the international tribunal's prosecutor, began
complaining publicly about the lack of cooperation she had received
from Western governments.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Arbour began to receive the help she sought from
British, German and U.S. military intelligence agencies, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said that ``this puts pressure on everyone else, is a
strong warning, and a strong assertion of renewed determination by
NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte, who succeeded Arbour, said the tribunals'
investigators have stepped up their work in turn, and expect to
bring as many as 50 more indictments of senior officials
responsible for crimes of genocide, murder and ``ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Del Ponte has intensified the demand on the nations of NATO for
intelligence support and military action against suspected war
criminals in the Balkans. She called Monday for those nations ``to
insist on the apprehension and surrender of all other indicted''
war criminals, and in particular Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' demands helped stiffen NATO's spine, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Krajisnik, an executive of Yugoslavia's biggest power company
before the nation war, has long been Karadzic's political tool.
Dealing in arms and business rackets during the Balkans war, he
also played a shrewd enough hand to emerge as the titular political
leader of Bosnia's Serbs in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Out of office since 1998, he still wielded political control in
concert with Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krajisnik is a big fish,'' the State Department spokesman,
James Rubin, said in an interview Monday. ``And we expect his
arrest to rattle Karadzic's cage.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans to arrest Karadzic have existed on paper since 1997. There
they have remained. U.S. officials say they were scuttled by U.S.
commanders who feared a bloody operation would inflame Serbs and
Americans alike.
</P>
<P>
   French officers also were reluctant to act against prominent
Serbs in and around Pale, the zone French forces command under
NATO's banner; in the past three years they have arrested one minor
suspect and killed another.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was the French forces taking the lead in Monday's
arrest, prompting the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, to
call France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, to offer her
congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French have been stung by criticism and were tired of
getting targeted'' for the fact that indicted war criminals like
Karadzic and Krajisnik seemed to live and work without fear in the
French zone, a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, 70 suspects are known to be under indictment by the
tribunal; other sealed indictments may also exist. Of those
suspects, 39 are now in custody, including Krajisnik, with 20 of
them having been arrested by NATO forces, according to the
Coalition for International Justice, a Washington group working
with the war crime tribunals in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krajisnik is by far the most senior person they've arrested,''
said Kathy Ward, a senior fellow at the coalition. ``This is by far
the strongest indication of a commitment by NATO to go after not
just the little fish but the most senior leaders.''

IN SEATTLE, A $35 BILLION PAPER LOSS BUT SUPPORT FOR MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST; see also MICROSOFT-ADVISORY) 
(ms) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ When Microsoft got its legal thrashing from a
federal judge Monday, the Seattle area's roaring economy got a bit
of a jolt too. With about 40 percent of the company's stock in the
hands of people who live in the region, roughly $35 billion, on
paper anyway, vanished here between the time Bill Gates and Steve
Ballmer rose Monday morning and the time the company's two top
leaders stepped to a podium here to respond to the judge's finding.
</P>
<P>
   But sounding no less self-assured than they have throughout
their antitrust battle with the government, both men calmly
defended the company's actions, predicted vindication in both the
marketplace and the legal arena, and reiterated a
through-the-looking-glass depiction of how government prosecutors
have misunderstood the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers know
_ that our software has helped make PCs more accessible and more
affordable to millions,'' said Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and
chairman. ``Innovation will continue to be the No. 1 priority at
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson concluded that the
company had violated antitrust laws and kept ``an oppressive
thumb'' on the competition, Ballmer insisted that Microsoft's legal
and image problems stemmed from the fact that it had never been
able to shed its little-guy mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent the past 25 years thinking of ourselves as a
small, aggressive company playing catch-up to industry giants even
though at some point along the way we became a large company,''
said Ballmer, the chief executive. ``Our intense focus on moving
forward has at times been seen as threatening and our passion for
being the best has been misinterpreted. We can do better. But that
doesn't mean innovating any less or delivering any less value to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   If such a view may inspire derision from competitors in Silicon
Valley, it still has considerable resonance in the Seattle area,
where Monday's news did not seem to generate any large sense of
panic. In fact, it prompted many people in the street to express
anger that _ as more than one person put it _ their taxpayer
dollars were being spent to ``harangue'' the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the government typed up the indictment, what did they use
to type it up with?'' said Selah Houdin, a student at Seattle
Central Community College. ``They used Microsoft. They had the
option to use other programs to type it up. They chose Microsoft
because it's best.''
</P>
<P>
   Money managers who are heavily invested in Microsoft stock were
clearly not happy, but most said they considered the company's
long-term prospects excellent and were not inclined to sell off
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think the outlook is much different than it was
Friday,'' said Bill Whitlow, manager of the Safeco Northwest Fund,
a mutual fund with roughly 6 percent of its $152 million in
holdings in Microsoft stock. Like many other analysts here, he said
the stock had actually enjoyed a run-up recently, built in part on
unrealistic expectations that a settlement was at hand. And several
noted that even if the company is broken up, a prospect they still
considered unlikely, the sum of its parts might well be worth more
than its current whole, as was famously the case with John D.
Rockefeller's Standard Oil trust.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Pascall, a senior fellow at the Institute for Public
Policy at the University of Washington, who has studied the
company's impact on the local economy, said many people here viewed
Monday's ruling as an ``interim legal event'' in a long-running
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not sure you're going to see a lot of gnashing of
teeth in response to this,'' said Pascall, who is also a columnist
in the local Puget Sound Business Journal. Asked to characterize
the fallout from Monday's ruling, he said: ``I would say that a
small number of people with large holdings of Microsoft stock
suffered a large one-day paper loss because of an overreaction to
the end of an unrealistic expectation of an early resolution. The
market has totally discounted the fact that Microsoft would have
had to make significant concessions to resolve the process through
negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   If such sanguine reactions were typical here, they may
themselves wind up being overly optimistic.

PROMINENT RADIO JOURNALIST IS SHOT TO DEATH IN HAITI 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Dominique, Haiti's most prominent radio journalist and a
passionate voice for democracy through decades of dictatorships and
political turmoil in his impoverished homeland, was shot to death
along with a security guard Monday by two gunmen outside his
station in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique, 69, was the founder of Radio Haiti Inter, whose news
and commentary in Creole and French were heard six days a week by
300,000 Haitian-Americans in the New York area in recent years and
by many of Haiti's 8 million people since the 1960s. He was shot as
he stepped from his car at 6:15 a.m., local time, the station said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen fled and there were no immediate arrests. Wounded
several times in the head and neck, Dominique and his guard,
Jean-Claude Louissaint, who was shot in the neck, were rushed to a
hospital in suburban Petionville, where both were pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the killing was unknown. But Haitian-Americans in
New York _ including Ricot Dupuy, the manager of Radio Soleil, the
Brooklyn station that carried Dominique's broadcasts _ and
Jean-Claude Bajeux, a former minister of culture and a human rights
advocate in Haiti, called it an assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was killed to silence his voice,'' said Dupuy. He noted
that Dominique, in recent broadcasts, had defended President Rene
Preval's decision to delay legislative elections until later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   News of Dominique's death _ solemnly broadcast by a substitute
announcer on ``Inter-Actualities,'' the 7 a.m. program on which the
victim and his wife, the journalist Michele Montas were to have
been the anchors _ was met with dismay, sorrow and anger in Haiti
and in the Haitian community in New York. He is also survived by
three daughters, Gigi, Dolores and Nadine.
</P>
<P>
   Preval, for whom Dominique was a special assistant; Prime
Minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis; and the former president
Jean-Bertrand Aristide went to the hospital but issued no
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince expressed ``great concern''
over ``the brutal slaying.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique was born in Port-au-Prince to a well-to-do family and
attended private schools in Haiti and France, studying agronomy,
said Jonathan Demme, the filmmaker, who did a documentary on
Dominique.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, when virtually all of Haiti's news media
were owned and used as propaganda outlets by the government,
Dominique founded Radio Haiti Inter as a voice of the people. It
was the first outlet to broadcast in Creole, the language of most
Haitians, 75 percent of whom are illiterate.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two decades, as Haiti was brutalized and
systematically looted by Francois Duvalier and his son,
Jean-Claude, Dominique was among the few pleading for human rights.
Friends said his life was threatened often by the Tontons Macoute,
the secret police. He was severely beaten, his brother was killed
and members of his family and staff were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Dominique's station was shut down and he was driven
into exile in New York. But in 1986, when a popular uprising
toppled Jean-Claude Duvalier, Dominique returned to rebuild his
station, and 50,000 people met him at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   He became a supporter of Aristide, who was elected president in
1990 in the first democratic elections in 33 years. But a year
later, Aristide was ousted by the army, thugs attacked and again
wrecked Radio Haiti and Dominique again went into exile, this time
with Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, after United States intervention, Aristide and
Dominique returned to Haiti. But while the radio station was
restored to life, democracy has remained elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique had defended the government's decision to delay the
elections, though opponents said it would help Aristide's allies,
because he believed that opponents were trying to rig them, Dupuy
of Radio Soleil said. ``He wanted to make sure the elections were
fair and democratic,'' he said.

 &HT;    Al-Amin's brother denounces `frenzy'
 &HT;    By Mae W. Gentry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Acting with ``the frenzy of a lynch mob,'' police
officials and the media have made it difficult for Jamil Abdullah
Al-Amin to get a fair trial, his brother said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Brown expressed outrage at ``irresponsible'' news coverage of
the case against his brother, the former H. Rap Brown, who is
accused of shooting two Fulton County sheriff's deputies, one
fatally, on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out Fulton County Sheriff Jackie Barrett for creating
a ``poisoned'' atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost from the beginning, she loaded the dice,'' he said.
``She came out with this charge that they were ambushed.'' That, he
said, implies premeditation.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the first time on behalf of Al-Amin's family,
Brown, who lives in southwest Atlanta, said they have ``tried to
take the high road, quietly putting together a defense team that
can prove him innocent.'' But, he said, he felt compelled to
balance the ``innuendo, rumor and unsubstantiated charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he and his siblings were reared ``with a strong sense
of right and wrong, morality and decency.'' They were taught, ``You
had a responsibility to make things better for the next
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 58, is the eldest of three children born in Baton Rouge,
La., to Thelma Warren Brown and Eddie C. Brown Sr. She worked as a
schoolteacher, domestic and dietitian; he was a pipefitter for Esso
Standard Oil. Both are deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's sister, Patricia, 57, is a retired music teacher who
lives in Washington. Al-Amin, 56, was born Hubert but changed his
name after converting to Islam in prison in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's activism _ as a member of the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee and as a Muslim leader _ was ``to help
people,'' said Brown, who is marketing manager for an engineering
firm and who has an even longer history of involvement of the
student-led movement to desegregate public accommodations
throughout the South. In 1960, he was expelled from Southern
University for political reasons, he said. His sister and brother
later attended Southern and were active in the student movement.
</P>
<P>
   Brown moved to Washington, enrolled in Howard University and
joined SNCC. Al-Amin followed him to D.C. and into the
organization, developing a reputation for militance that put him
under FBI scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has continued to promote the electoral process. He became
executive director of the Voter Education Project, an agency whose
staffers conducted voter registration workshops and
get-out-the-vote campaigns. When it disbanded in 1992, Brown turned
his efforts to emerging democracies. He observed elections and
conducted voter education and registration in post-apartheid South
Africa, among other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's spiritual journey led him down a different path. For
more than two decades he has been leader of a mosque in Atlanta's
West End neighborhood, site of the killing of the deputies,
Aldranon English and Ricky Kinchen. Kinchen died in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   People in West End have been generally supportive of Al-Amin,
crediting him with ridding the neighborhood of drugs and
prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said his brother tried to build an Islamic community.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's plans were taking shape in White Hall, Ala. An
architect had been hired, and a model built for a community that
would offer housing, a specialty supermarket, and other goods and
services for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Alabama that Al-Amin participated in voter
registration drives and became a friend of John Jackson, now mayor
of White Hall, where Al-Amin was captured four days after the
deputies were shot.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Al-Amin's claim that his arrest was a ``government
conspiracy'' may not be farfetched. Many black leaders have been
targets of the government, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time when he was arrested in Cambridge (Md.), we have
assumed he was under surveillance,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown calls a report in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that
Al-Amin was under investigation in 14 unsolved killings
``irresponsible to the highest degree. It has no bearing on what
he's being charged with, and there was no evidence,'' Brown said.
Al-Amin was never charged in those homicides.
</P>
<P>
   A national defense fund is being organized in Atlanta, and a Web
site is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility to withhold judgment extends to media and to
Sheriff Barrett, Brown said. ``I understand her sense of grief and
the sense of grief of those families, but we still have an
obligation to ensure that an accused person gets a fair trial.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT EAGER TO IMPOSE STRICTURES ON MICROSOFT
PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(jt) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ebullient over their legal victory against
Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said Monday that
they would examine possible remedies to put an end what a federal
judge described as the company's monopolistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
wrote that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. His
decision will provide the basis for further court hearings _ and
possibly settlement negotiations _ to determine what remedies to
impose on Microsoft. The company said it would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Joel Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, offered little indication of what
specific steps government lawyers would recommend to Jackson, who
must decide on any enforcement sanctions against the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``While no final decision has been made,'' Klein said, ``the
department is committed to finding a remedy that will protect
consumers, innovation and competition by putting an end to
Microsoft's widespread and persistent abuse of its monopoly power
and to rectifying its unlawful attempt to monopolize the Internet
browser market.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Attorney General Janet Reno expressed
satisfaction over the ruling. ``We are pleased that the court
agreed with the department that Microsoft abused its monopoly
power, that it violated the antitrust laws, and that it harmed
consumers,'' she said. ``Microsoft has been held accountable for
its illegal conduct by a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision culminated the Clinton administration's most
ambitious antitrust effort.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic
presidential candidate, said that Gore had no comment on the
ruling. Gore received an icy reception when he visited the
company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., last November. Gore did
not explicitly embrace the antitrust action, but said then that
``the values that are inherent in the antitrust laws are ones that
are sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican candidate,
said that as president he would ``fully enforce antitrust laws,''
but would not discuss specifics of the case because it remained in
litigation and would be appealed by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said the ruling would bring positive change. ``It will
benefit America's consumers by opening the door to competition,
increased innovation and increased consumer choice in the software
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ruling showed how no company is above the law. ``It
demonstrates once again that no company, no matter how powerful or
how successful, can refuse to play by the rules, and thwart
competition for America's consumers,'' Klein said. ``Competition
has been at the heart of America's economy, and protecting
competition at the heart of antitrust enforcement for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys general for some of the states that joined in the
government's case said they favored strict sanctions, which might
include the breakup of the Microsoft. Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal urged Jackson to ``adopt remedies that are as
far-reaching and fundamental as Microsoft's abuses of its
monopoly.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. violated the nation's antitrust
laws through predatory and anticompetitive behavior and kept ``an
oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune,'' a federal
judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court, sided
with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive
antitrust suit, though he surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling
for Microsoft in one area.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the 19 states pressing the suit
contended that Microsoft had hurt consumers by stifling competition
in the software marketplace, particularly at the expense of the
Netscape browser. Jackson's findings of fact in the case, issued in
November, overwhelmingly supported that view.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said that Monday's ruling, applying the
antitrust laws to those findings, laid the foundation for a
powerful remedy. That will be decided in a separate proceeding to
begin within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Options range from imposing restrictions on Microsoft's conduct
to breaking up the company. Senior government officials familiar
with the views of the state and federal officers who are pursuing
the case said that many were interested in requesting a breakup,
though no decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came just 48 hours after settlement talks collapsed.
On Saturday a court-appointed mediator announced that despite four
months of mediation and after consideration of almost 20 drafts of
a settlement offer, the gulf between the two sides remained
unbridgeable.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson issued his judgment at 5 p.m., after the stock markets
had closed. But reacting to the failure of the settlement talks and
in anticipation of the judgment, Microsoft's stock plunged Monday,
losing almost 14 percent of its value. That helped fuel a broad
decline in the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In his 43-page conclusions of law, Jackson's final judgment on
the evidence, the judge wrote that ``the court concludes that
Microsoft maintained its monopoly power by anticompetitive means
and attempted to monopolize the Web browser market,'' as well as
``unlawfully tying its Web browser to its operating system'' _ all
in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the judge ruled that Microsoft's marketing
arrangements with other companies to promote its Web browser at
Netscape's expense did not have sufficient effect to violate the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft seemed to take little solace from prevailing on that
point. Bill Gates, the company's chairman, did not even refer to
the one judgment in the company's favor when he announced that
Microsoft would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers know
_ that our software has helped make PCs more accessible and more
affordable to millions,'' Gates said. ``We believe we have a strong
case on appeal.''

 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By Sunday afternoon, the ringlets of cut hair and
traces of ponytails are swept up at the Ene Hair Salon in
Manhattan's East Village. The swivel chairs and the bubble hair
dryer are tucked in a corner. But jars of aqua-blue Barbicide,
hairspray and pomade still line the counters as men and women sway
forward and back across the wine-red plywood floor.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, many go to the salon for trims, highlights,
conditioning treatments, maybe an upper body massage. But come
Sunday afternoon, they are infected by mambo madness when the
basement-level salon on East Ninth Street turns into a dance
palace.
</P>
<P>
   Their hips are rotating. Their arms coil upward as they twirl.
Some count out the beat for the syncopated steps under their breath
as they plunge into a dip, then a spin.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the salon proprietor's Pekingese poodle terrier,
Virginia (nicknamed Peekapoo), weaves between the legs of the mambo
dancers, barking at the Afro-Cuban melodies.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to become indifferent to the oddities of the East
Village, a neighborhood where pierced noses and spiky dyed hair are
common and boutiques with names like Religious Sex sell leather
corsets. This is New York, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is something particularly off-kilter, like a campy
John Waters film, to the mambo scene at Ene on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Even as chorus lines of more than a dozen people heat up the
floor, elbow to elbow, a few frazzled people amble in, eager to
make appointments for haircuts and colorings. On a recent Sunday,
an aggressive salesman blustered through the door, insisting on
giving his sales pitch for an electronics product to the salon
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you see we're dancing, man,'' said the annoyed
proprietor, Nelson Barreto, who was trying to maneuver a mambo
turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came a long way,'' huffed the indignant salesman, glaring
over his shoulder on his way out.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, though, passers-by stop in their tracks on
the sidewalk, peering inside the bay window of the Ene salon. The
place is hard to miss. It has a lavender-painted facade and in the
window is a two-foot-high statue of a praying angel, with a
container of hair gel between its wings. (The salon gets its name,
Ene, from the Spanish pronunciation of the letter n (EN-eh), the
initial of the owner's first name.)
</P>
<P>
   The mambo tradition, if it can be called one yet, began about
two months ago when Barreto, the owner, agreed to let the boyfriend
of one of his hairstylists hold dance classes there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do something else that we hadn't done before,''
said Barreto, a 35-year-old native of Puerto Rico. He lives in a
fifth-floor walk-up next door. ``We're given a license to make you
feel beautiful and music is an addition to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes began with a few clients on the salon's mailing list,
but the mambo sessions have grown exponentially as clients have
told their friends. Like the homey salon, the $15-dollar classes
draw a multicultural crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It is not quite the Palladium in midtown Manhattan, the
legendary Latin ballroom that was ground zero for the mambo in the
1950. But the salon has created its own special comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like they know us,'' Barreto said. ``It's less
threatening than going to a club or a huge class, where people know
how to dance. Some don't want people to know they have two left
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nuss-Caneda, a 37-year-old public school teacher from
Brooklyn, has her long reddish-brown hair colored at the salon. But
on Sundays, she is accompanied by her Mexican-born husband, Rene, a
Spanish-language tutor. She appreciates the diversity of the salon
as much as learning the mambo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to work hard to find communities that are
different,'' she said. ``This is a way that we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Sunday, it was getting steamy inside the salon so the
door was left open. The customers were learning a beginner's step,
the right foot crossing over the left foot as hips twist and swivel
on three beats. The instructor, Frankie Martinez, calls it the
``Suzy-Q,'' because the step feels the way it sounds as the hips
twist, twist, twist.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, a trimly built 24-year-old with a goatee, learned the
mambo from his mentor, Eddie Torres, a leading New York mambo
teacher who has a professional dance troupe. Martinez is a member.
The mambo is the original version of the popular dance called the
salsa, but it is danced on a different time structure. Torres has a
repertory of more than 350 mambo steps.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who also holds a black belt in karate, started dancing
only about two years ago. He has taught mambo for one year.
</P>
<P>
   It is evident that some customers will never advance to what
might be called mambo's black belt, an intricate pattern of quick
steps that is sort of like skating with feet. Torres calls it the
``syncopated jelly jam, a little dab will do you.''
</P>
<P>
   The instructor, who was dressed the other day in a billowy white
shirt, cream-colored pants and black and white dance shoes,
remained consistently upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mambo divas, you,'' Martinez called out, his dimples
deepening as the dancers laughed. They snapped their fingers to
find the driving beat when the instructor turned on the tape
player. As the two-hour session progressed, they stopped glancing
at their feet so much, undulating quickly, confidently.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Hernandez, already an experienced salsa dancer, heard
about the class through a friend and has not missed a Sunday. It
relaxes her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I know salsa, the steps in mambo are shorter and
faster than salsa steps,'' said Hernandez, 43, a home-care
supervisor in Brooklyn. ``It's like learning something totally
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Gieringer, a 47-year-old artist in cargo pants and
sneakers, was taking a break under a bubble hair dryer as her
husband, Polar Levine, and the other men were practicing turns. Her
husband, a musician whose head is bald except for a single
dreadlock at the nape of his neck, said he gets inspiration from
Martinez's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get brain lock when I'm taught stuff, but he's real good and
when I unlock my brain, I'm killer,'' said Levine, leaning into a
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Among the salon's most loyal customers is Toni Castillo, a
petite 51-year-old, who on Sundays brings her grim-faced boyfriend,
Carlos Flores. He was stuck the other day on a move called the
``drop-catch.'' Turning with his back facing Castillo, Flores had
to drop his partner's hand down his back and lightly catch it with
the opposite hand.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, wearing jeans and black stiletto heels, giggled that
her 45-year-old boyfriend told her that she should get a leg
transplant to improve her moves. She does not mind that he pokes
fun at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come in every single Sunday,'' she said merrily. ``It's
been beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As dusk fell on a recent Sunday, the mambo instructor's
girlfriend, Aisha Koswara, sat quietly next to a row of sinks.
</P>
<P>
   She was listening to a woman who had wandered in off the street.
The woman, Ann Schwanke, owns a lingerie import business and spoke
to Koswara about feeling a bit psychic. Not even five minutes
before, she said she was thinking about Latin dance lessons _ then
there was the mambo class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw something going on in the hair salon that was not
hair,'' said Schwanke, who began displaying silken lingerie from a
bag to Koswara in hopes of collaborating on a lingerie mambo party.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Koswara, a svelte 22-year-old with a pierced
diamond stud in her nose, joins her boyfriend, Martinez, on the
floor to give a dazzling demonstration of a tricky step. The class
watches the couple's liquid moves in silence before bursting into
applause.
</P>
<P>
   It was the hairstylist's idea to have mambo classes at the
salon. She saw nothing unusual in it. She noted how her mother, a
Puerto Rican, met her father, newly arrived in New York from
Indonesia, in an underground gambling den in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens in the Village,'' she said with a shrug.

 &HT;    FBI seeks Al-Amin Alabama helpers
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The FBI is investigating about 10 people in the tiny
town of White Hall, Ala., who may have helped Jamil Abdullah
Al-Amin after he fled there last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Imfeld, special agent in charge of the FBI's investigation
of Al-Amin in Alabama, said Mayor John Jackson, a longtime friend
of the former black militant turned Islamic spiritual leader, is
among the people under investigation. Al-Amin's black Mercedes-Benz
was found last week on property owned by Jackson's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ruling anyone out _ including Mayor Jackson ... in
the harboring case,'' Imfeld said Friday. ``We are also looking at
four of Al-Amin's friends stopped in a black Cadillac and some
other people in the town.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will be cleared from suspicion, Imfeld said, until
evidence collected from Al-Amin's black Mercedes-Benz is tested and
returned to the FBI and Atlanta police.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has vehemently denied harboring Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Al-Amin's friends, detained the same night the suspect
was captured in a patch of woods, also have denied they saw Al-Amin
after he arrived in the town.
</P>
<P>
   The four are acquainted with Al-Amin and also are members of
White Hall's small Islamic community. They were released from jail
after police determined there was not enough evidence linking them
to the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   A day before Al-Amin's Mercedes was found, the car's Georgia
license plate was discovered behind the Bismillah Cafe, a small
restaurant once operated by Al-Amin.

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS CUBAN BOY SHOULD BE WITH HIS FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In her strongest words on the issue so far,
Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that Elian Gonzalez belonged
with his father, and she roundly criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and others, saying they were exploiting the boy's misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe personally that this little boy should be with his
father,'' she said at a news conference called by state Democratic
officials to endorse legislation that would ratchet up penalties
for hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is how I would see his particular interest at
this time,'' Clinton said of the 6-year-old boy, ``but I also
believe that this is not a decision that politicians should be
making.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, politicians from Giuliani to Vice President Al
Gore have called for congressional legislation that would grant
permanent resident status to Elian and allow him to remain in the
United States while a family court decides whether he should be
returned to his father or be allowed to stay with relatives in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Clinton made a point of singling out Giuliani
for her harshest remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that the mayor has tried to politicize this issue in
this Senate campaign,'' Clinton said. ``I wish everybody would take
a deep breath, and a step back, and let's try to get this child
into a safe, permanent, loving, unexploited home and family as soon
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether her criticism also applied to Gore, Clinton
said: ``You know, the vice president and I are going to disagree
from time to time. But on all of the big issues facing our country,
we are in absolute agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's office did not respond to several messages seeking
comment.

QUIET HAAS MAKING LOUDEST NOISES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Champagne flowed in the tiny motel room, where family members
waited for the conquering hero to wash away the residue from a long
afternoon on the golf course and join in the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   As toasts were raised to Hunter Haas' victory at the 1999 U.S.
Public Links Championship, which clinched his spot in the 2000
Masters, the mood was altered by the strains of pounding on the
shower door.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hunter, the quietest of seven siblings in the Haas
household, doing something most uncharacteristic. He was releasing
emotion. Soon, the pounding begat shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen Corner! Amen Corner!'' Haas hollered between thumps. ``I
can't believe I just won a USGA event!''
</P>
<P>
   Hans Haas, one of Hunter's older brothers and soon-to-be Masters
caddie, smiled as he recalled the culmination of their weeklong
stay in Alton, Ill. With Hunter's 4 and 3 victory against Michael
Kirk in the final match of the U.S. Golf Association event, the
graduate of Southwest High School in Fort Worth, Texas, completed a
circuitous journey from Sycamore Creek Golf Course to Augusta
National Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the 23-year-old will become the first amateur golfer
from Fort Worth to compete in the Masters since Lindy Miller
finished 16th in 1978 and John Grace in 1975-76, who missed the cut
both years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of the Masters stuff really hit him until he
was in there,'' Hans Haas said of a shower scene that, from his
perspective, ranks with anything produced by Alfred Hitchcock in
terms of lasting impact. ``It was never mentioned the whole time we
were rooming together.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Hunter said, the ramifications of his match against
Kirk _ winner to Augusta, loser reduced to watching on television _
dominated his thoughts that morning on the way to Spencer T. Olin
Community Golf Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided whoever dropped that from his mind first and shut
that out of his head would have the best chance,'' Hunter said.
``It didn't cross my mind again until afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Such focus is rare, said Roland Harper, the former Colonial
Country Club head golf professional who has tutored Haas since
childhood. But it is something Harper began noticing shortly after
Haas recorded his first ace, as an 8-year-old, on Colonial's 13th
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the junior golfers I've had, he's the one I thought
would be special,'' said Harper, 72. ``There's something about his
attitude that's different from the rest. Hunter is unusually calm.
If he shows any emotion on the course, it's a spark and then it's
gone. He stays in control of what he's doing, and he's done that
since he was 12. That was the thing that always made me feel like
he'd be special.'' A QUIET LONER
</P>
<P>
   Even among seven siblings with enviable golf resumes, Hunter
stands out. He was the first of Jim and Karen Haas' children to be
born at home, rather than in a hospital, after the couple decided
four offspring had provided them enough insight to eliminate
doctors from the birthing process. He's the only loner among an
otherwise outgoing group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys think he's a jerk because he doesn't say much,''
said Heidi Haas, 21, the sibling closest in age to Hunter. ``But
he's not. He's introverted and the rest of us are extroverted. Out
of seven kids, somebody had to be the quiet one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's his name. Hunter is the only Haas child with five
names on his birth certificate: Hunter Jefferson Huck Finn Haas. An
avid Mark Twain fan, Jim convinced Karen to include the name of a
favorite literary character in his youngest son's official handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter used to be a little bit shy about it, but not any
more,'' Jim Haas said. ``It's distinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter has embraced his uniqueness to the point that, in the
golf bag he carries, one headcover is emblazoned with ``Huck,''
another ``Finn.'' He also has made peace with the fact he's a
perpetual sufferer from ``Little Brother Syndrome,'' which drove
him, at age four, to enter his first Fort Worth city junior golf
tournament. Holly, his oldest sister, followed Hunter around
Sycamore Creek to help him count strokes and fill out his
scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Holly became the first of five Haas children to win
a city, state or high school district golf championship. Hunter
watched as trophies began filling the family home. The ones that
most caught his eye belonged to Hans, who was five years older but
the brother closest to his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever my brother did, I set a goal to do better,'' Hunter
Haas said. ``I wanted to start beating him, whatever it took.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't easy. Hans won three state high school titles, two
city championships and a state amateur title. He landed a golf
scholarship at Arkansas, then transferred to Oklahoma. Hunter
eventually made his mark for the Sooners as well, winning the 1998
Big 12 individual championship.
</P>
<P>
   But such accomplishments seemed far off in the days when Hans,
28, and Hud, 30, used their little brother as a tackling dummy in
games of backyard football. The older brothers would be the
quarterbacks and defenders on respective two-man teams, with Hunter
the permanent receiver who shifted between squads and absorbed all
the punishment after catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just hammer him the whole game,'' said Hud, now the
superintendent of greens at The Academy at WaterChase. ``I think
that toughened him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, it sharpened his hunger for success. Jim Haas
recalled settling many a dispute between Hans and Hunter when the
competitive juices overflowed, from who shot the lowest golf score
to who grabbed the largest chicken drumstick at the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think those two would cut each other's throat for a
dime. It brought my wife to tears over the intensity of it,'' Jim
Haas said. ``But it was instrumental in developing Hunter's
mystique on the golf course.'' BREAKTHROUGH
</P>
<P>
   It took years, but Hunter finally had his breakthrough moment.
On a makeshift green in the back yard, he made up for mountains of
lost baseball cards by beating Hans in a chipping contest. He can't
recall the year, Hunter said, but he was in high school and Hans
was home from college.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big boost for me. If I could beat him, I could beat
anybody,'' said Hunter, who soon thereafter posted a lower score
than his brother for the first time in an actual round.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence gained from succeeding as an underdog against Hans
eventually propelled Hunter to bigger things, like back-to-back
Texas State Boys Junior Championships (1994, 1995) and four
consecutive district titles at Southwest. Of 24 high-profile titles
won by members of the Haas family as junior golfers, Hunter added
eight to the family collection, including two Fort Worth city
junior championships.
</P>
<P>
   After completing his eligibility at Oklahoma, Haas' career took
its biggest upsurge last summer, when he won two of the nation's
most prestigious amateur events _ the Public Links and the Porter
Cup _ and reached the semifinals of the U.S. Amateur. By the time
he'd posted a 3-1 record for the U.S. team in the 1999 Walker Cup,
amateur golf's version of the Ryder Cup, Haas found himself headed
to Augusta as the nation's top-ranked amateur.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrives, he'll have no bigger ally on the grounds than
Hans, the lifelong adversary who will carry his bag. Through their
battles growing up, Hunter said the two formed a friendship to go
with their rivalry. At Hans' wedding on Feb. 26, Hunter and Hud
shared best man duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter knows I can push his buttons, for the good or the
bad,'' Hans Haas said. ``My goal going down there is to keep Hunter
in check and not let his emotions get the best of him. He has the
game to compete with the best in the world. I'm not saying that
because he's my brother. I see it. Hunter would beat me like a
drum, up and down, if we played every day.''
</P>
<P>
   How well Haas will fare against the Masters field is open for
debate. Harper predicted Haas would make the cut. Jim Haas said his
son ``thinks he can win.'' Hunter Haas, who finished second in the
Azalea Amateur on March 26 in his final pre-Masters tuneup, said he
has no definitive goal beyond making ``as many pars and birdies as
I can'' and playing four rounds, if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Haas spent the weekend of March 10-12 practicing at the course
and said he felt ``a lot more comfortable'' on the layout than he
expected. He'll play practice rounds this week with Tom Lehman and
Arnold Palmer, among others, in quest of additional insight.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, a four-time Masters champ, was the first player Haas
approached about a practice round. They plan to play Tuesday, along
with David Gossett, the U.S. Amateur champ from the University of
Texas. Haas said Palmer, 70, provided a logical source of Masters
insight because ``if you think about who's been most successful
there and still plays, it's probably him.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have not met, but Haas saved the letter Palmer wrote
him, confirming plans for Tuesday's practice round. At Augusta,
Haas said his greatest strength _ a stellar short game _ should
come into play more than at most major-championship venues because
of the short rough and undulating terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can scramble from anywhere,'' Haas said. ``I can hit it
average and still score well because my short game will take care
of the rest.'' MASTERY OF SHORT GAME
</P>
<P>
   Part of that attitude was instilled from sessions with Harper,
who stresses one recurring theme to students: All else pales when
weighed against the ability to get the ball in the hole within two
shots from inside 50 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter is one of the few who took me to heart on that,''
Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he took lessons at Colonial, Haas rarely played the
course while growing up. A self-employed painter, Jim Haas
relinquished the family membership at the club because of financial
concerns before Hunter's 10th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   That meant Hunter and Heidi, the youngest members of the Haas
clan to play college golf, honed their skills primarily at
municipal courses. On summer days, Hunter often would complete a
round at Pecan Valley Golf Course, then stay for six hours rolling
putts on the practice green. In July and August, said Heidi, the
grass on that green was essentially threadbare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd hit across divot holes and he was still making putts,''
she said. ``That's why he has such a great short game. He learned
off nothing, under the crappiest conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's the final member of a golf-crazed family still
competing regularly in tournaments. He'll have all of his siblings,
plus their spouses, following him in Augusta. In many ways, the
Masters will serve as a reunion for a group that could be
considered the First Family of amateur golf in Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect Jim Haas to see it that way. Unlike Dallas
resident Ernie Kuehne, who welcomed being labeled as the patriarch
of ``America's First Family of Amateur Golf'' after daughter Kelli
and son Hank won U.S. Amateur championships, Jim Haas said he
considers such labels ``embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be awfully vain to say that, even with all the
stuff they've done,'' he said. ``Our kids have had a lot of fun
playing golf and they've gotten a lot of attention from it. But
history takes care of itself with those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never saw Byron Nelson pumping himself up like that. Or
Ben Hogan. In some ways, Hunter's a lot like Hogan ... kind of a
nice fellow who keeps to himself. I don't think he'll change. If
Hunter ever gets to flitting around in a limo, acting \Rspoiled\S
like one of the Cowboys, I can about guarantee one of his brothers
will knock his head between his shoulders real low and get him back
where he should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although comparisons with the Kuehnes are inevitable, and the
two families maintain an amicable relationship, Jim Haas said a
clear line of demarcation exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the blue collars and Hank's people are the Highland Park
group,'' he said. ``I'm friendly with Ernie, but he's a different
personality type.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, is Hunter. Quiet and intense, he's prone to action, not
words. That is why Harper said he became emotional when Haas showed
him the ring he earned for winning the 1998 Big 12 championship.
Inscribed on the side are the initials ``RH,'' for Roland Harper.
Also ``PIP,'' which stands for ``Play in the Present,'' a Harper
buzz phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``You teach all your life and something like that makes it worth
all the work and time and heartache,'' said Harper, who retired in
1992. ``When I saw that, that made me feel really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas considered it a fitting tribute to the guy who got him
started on what he hopes will be a career in professional golf.
Haas plans to turn professional after the Masters, but might wait
until May, to enhance his opportunity of landing an amateur's
exemption into the MasterCard Colonial (May 18-21). STUBBORN AND
CONFIDENT
</P>
<P>
   Asked to identify his greatest strength as a golfer, Haas cited
``stubbornness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to convince me I can't do something,'' he said,
sounding every bit the driven little brother. ``I've got a lot of
confidence and I'm going to do it my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas' way has taken him to Augusta. Among his closest
confidants, the only one missing this week will be Harper. The
former Colonial club pro is battling skin cancer and will be
undergoing chemotherapy sessions until Thursday at a local
hospital. By Friday morning, Harper said he plans to be home in
Granbury, in front of a television, getting updates on Haas'
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Hud Haas, meanwhile, eagerly awaits his first journey down
Magnolia Lane, from the front gate to the Augusta clubhouse. While
a student at Mississippi State studying golf-course agronomy, he
stood at that gate and displayed his superintendent's card, seeking
an audience with the man in charge of manicuring the Masters
layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every question I asked, the guard said, `No,' '' he recalled.
``Things didn't pan out, to say the least. Now, the superintendent
wants to meet me. Who would have figured my little brother would be
the one to change that?'' nn

BASEBALL'S TOP CATCHER ALSO AN ALL-STAR FAMILY MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American League Most Valuable Player hits .300 every year,
wins Gold Gloves and plays in the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez is also good at playing Monkey in the Middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two people on each side and someone in the middle,''
his daughter Amanda, 4, explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two people throw it to each other,'' continued Dereck, 7,
the oldest of Rodriguez's three children. ``The person in the
middle tries to catch it. If he does, the person who threw it is
It.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand?
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez does because he plays the game often. He also wrestles
with Dereck, takes Amanda swimming and sits on the sofa and watches
television for hours on end with his wife, Maribel. There were also
nights during spring training in Port Charlotte of Putt-Putt Golf,
Go-Kart Racing and dinner at Sarasota's swanky St. Armand's Circle,
just like any tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy is a good daddy because he always plays with me,''
Amanda said.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the best catcher in baseball's efforts to be
the best father possible. While growing up in Puerto Rico in a
house usually filled with relatives, friends and neighbors,
Rodriguez came to the conclusion that family is and always should
be important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to be alone,'' said Rodriguez, whose second
daughter, Ivanna, was born on Jan. 12. ``When I grew up, there were
always people in the house. When I go on the road, when I'm in a
room by myself, I get lonely. I need somebody to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was up to me, my family would go everywhere with me.
They can't because of school, but I enjoy having my family around
me.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Dereck is around often enough, just reaching the age
where he can go to the ballpark with his dad without needing mom to
supervise. Tall and skinny for his age _ he doesn't look like
another Pudge _ with a snappy crewcut, Dereck was all over the
Rangers' compound this spring, on the field and in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a sight seeing Rodriguez stroll into the Rangers'
clubhouse with Dereck tagging along right behind him holding a
small pouch and his dad's cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was his dad's phone wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have him along because it keeps him out of
trouble,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   That is until Dereck goes tearing through the clubhouse bouncing
a basketball, swinging a bat or indulging in his favorite pastime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being in the clubhouse because I get to take stuff out
of guys lockers and hide it,'' Dereck said.
</P>
<P>
   He also doesn't mind taking a few hitting lessons from batting
coach Rudy Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the blood,'' Rodriguez says proudly. ``He could be a
player, but I don't want to push him. I want him to be a baseball
player if he likes. But if he wants to be something else, I'll help
him do what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually those plans change on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day he wants to do something different,'' Maribel said.
``We took him to the Air Show with the Blue Angels and he wanted to
be a pilot. Then, as we were leaving, he talked to some guy who's
in the Army. Now he wants to be in the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   His dad always wanted to be a baseball player. Dereck's mother
never quite knew what to make of that.
</P>
<P>
   Maribel Rivera was born in Puerto Rico but grew up in Brooklyn.
She was 15 when she moved back to Puerto Rico and was introduced to
Rodriguez a couple months later. He had just signed his first
contract with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't into sports,'' she said. ``I really didn't know who
he was. His brother introduced us. I just liked being around him
and the way he was. He was funny. He still is.''
</P>
<P>
   Maribel spent most of the spring in Florida with the family, but
only went to a couple of games. She spent most of her time at their
rental house with the two daughters while Dereck was wrestling with
Rafael Palmeiro or hiding his equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like watching Pudge play,'' she said. ``But when I know he's
not going to play, I don't go to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   They dated while Rodriguez was in the minor leagues. They were
supposed to get married on June 20, 1991, but that was the day
Rodriguez was called up to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to get married that day,'' Rodriguez said. ``But
(Tulsa manager) Bobby Jones called me in into his office and told
me I had to be in Chicago the next day. I had to tell her we
couldn't get married.''
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that Rodriguez got married that morning, then
went to Chicago and right into the Rangers' lineup. But that's not
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows it, but we didn't get married,'' Rodriguez said
with a smile. ``We got married down here (the following spring). We
drove over to Punta Gorda and got married.''
</P>
<P>
   Maribel admitted she had a tough time getting used to being the
wife of a major league star and sharing him with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been overwhelming and in such little time,'' she said.
``So many things have happened. People wanted him to do so many
things. I'd plan something together as a family and then we'd have
to cancel it. I think only in the last 21/2 years have I started
getting used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things she hasn't become comfortable with, like people
asking not only for her husband's autograph, but hers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that,'' she said. ``That's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   The autograph craze can be bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to Wet N' Wild, we're in the pool, and people ask
for his autograph,'' she said. ``People come up to him with
baseballs and baseball cards at Wet N' Wild. They're in their
bathing suits. I'm wondering where they got the baseballs from. I
still don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for privacy and time alone with family has led the
Rodriguez family to seek their own private sanctuary. They have a
house in Colleyville where Dereck and Amanda attend a Montessori
school, and they still have a home in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   But they also have an apartment in Miami and are seriously
considering building a home there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Miami,'' Rodriguez said. ``Miami is like Puerto Rico. I
love water and I love the ocean. I like to be in a boat, I enjoy
going out on the ocean in a boat. I want to build a house on a
canal so I can put a boat in my backyard. So when I want to go out
on the water, I can just go in my backyard and get in my own
boat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus Miami just is an hour and fifty minutes away from Puerto
Rico by plane and just two hours from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason Rodriguez likes Miami over Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Puerto Rico,'' Rodriguez said. ``Puerto Rico is
beautiful. It's my country. But the schools in Puerto Rico aren't
as good as here in the states. Dereck went to school there and had
a bad experience. That was it. The work he did over here is totally
different.''
</P>
<P>
   For the American League's Most Valuable Player, it remains all
about the family coming first. nn

HOUSTON WARNED OF NEW COMPUTER VIRUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A computer virus that erases hard drives, then makes bogus calls
to 911 emergency service providers has been detected in the Houston
area, the FBI's National Infrastructure Protection Center warned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the FBI/NIPC office in Washington said the virus
targets computers set up for file and print sharing, scanning
thousands of computers through four internet service providers _
America On-Line, AT&AMP;T, MCI and Netzero.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few computers have been affected by the virus,
however, the spokesman said. He declined to say when the virus
first struck, nor specifically how many computers may have been
affected. The first warning in the case was issued Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sonya Lopez, spokeswoman for the Greater Harris County 911
Network, said 911 centers in Harris and Fort Bend counties were
warned of the virus Monday morning. Only one bogus call has been
received in Harris County, she said. A second call was made to the
Anderson County Sheriff's Department in Palestine, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the apparently few cases, Matt Yarbrough, a former
computer crimes prosecutor with the U.S. attorney's office in
Dallas, described the virus as ``pretty darn scary.''
</P>
<P>
   He likened the 911 virus attack to earlier efforts to flood
Amazon.com, Yazoo and other Web sites with transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stores itself in your autoload file, then when you come
back to work, turn on your computer, it loads itself up and dials
911,'' said Yarbrough, now a special Internet counsel with Vinson &AMP;
Elkins' Dallas office. ``If you have hundreds or thousands of
users, you've got hundreds or thousands of calls going to 911. It's
flooded. It has the potential to shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can probably wait for an ambulance when you have a
heart attack, right? This is pretty malicious stuff. It's pretty
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Such hacking is in violation of federal and state laws. If
convicted of intentionally interfering with computers, an offender
could be sentenced to as much as five years in prison and fined
$250,000 for each affected computer.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of the virus should immediately report the episode to
the FBI/NIPC at 202-323-3204.

IT'S OFFICIAL: MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTITRUST LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. violated federal antitrust laws by scheming to
monopolize one of the Internet age's crucial consumer markets, a
federal judge ruled Monday, in a verdict that wiped out billions of
dollars in Microsoft stock value.
</P>
<P>
   In a 43-page judgment that accused the software empire founded
by Bill Gates of ``a deliberate assault upon entrepreneurial
efforts'' by technology rivals, US District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson found Microsoft's efforts to corner the market for
Web browsers repeatedly violated the Sherman antitrust act and
antitrust laws of 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the ruling, released shortly after 5 p.m., Wall
Street pounded Microsoft shares down $15.375, or 14.47 percent, to
$90.875 before trading was briefly halted. The implosion drove a
nearly 8 percent drop in the technology-heavy Nasdaq market index,
its worst one-day slide in point terms.
</P>
<P>
   The worst selloff in Microsoft since the 1987 market crash
temporarily wiped out $12.1 billion of Gates' personal wealth,
dropping the value of his Microsoft holdings from $83.6 billion to
$71.5 billion, although company stock began to rebound in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling had been expected in light of his harsh
``findings of fact'' in November that called Microsoft a
monopolistic bully. But the judgment did not address what
punishment the Redmond, Wash., company might face.
</P>
<P>
   It could take months of further hearings and deliberations
before Judge Jackson decides on sanctions. And both the ruling
finding Microsoft guilty of antitrust violations and whatever
remedies Jackson orders appear certain to be appealed by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft and government lawyers said they remain open to a
settlement. But the most recent negotiations collapsed in failure
Saturday, amid reported squabbling between federal prosecutors and
state attorneys general over how far to go in punishing Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson's ruling survives the expected appeals to the US
Supreme Court, Microsoft could face billions in fines, wide-ranging
restrictions on how it does business, a demand it reveal the secret
contents of its Windows computer operating code, or even an
AT&AMP;T-style breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, whose department pressed the case
against Microsoft, said the judge's ruling showed that ``consumers
have been harmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel I. Klein, the top antitrust enforcer for the US Justice
Department, said Jackson's ``landmark opinion'' will ``set the
ground rules for enforcement in the Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrates once again that no company, no matter how
powerful or how successful, can refuse to play by the rules and
thwart competition for America's consumers,'' Klein said. He said
antitrust prosecutors will insist on ``a remedy that we think will
have an enduring impact going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an evening press conference, an unrepentant Gates said,
``There are several steps ahead in this case... . We believe we
have a strong case on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Microsoft remains open to settling the case before
Jackson rules on what punishment it should face, Steve Ballmer, the
company's chief executive officer, said, ``We'd love to continue
discussions in an appropriate way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ballmer also said, ``Until the appeal is over, nothing is
settled.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling opens the door for a spate of civil antitrust suits
against Microsoft by technology companies, large and small, that
can claim its conduct cost them revenues and profits. Among them
are companies Jackson cited as victims, including IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Netscape, and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun, whose Java operating
software was cited by Jackson as a target of Microsoft's
anticompetitive efforts, urged the judge to ``act decisively to
ensure that Microsoft's illegal activity _ and the harm that it has
done to the industry and to consumers _ is brought to an end
forcefully and permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   McNealy said the only way to protect consumers and industry
competitors is to break up Microsoft. He said the company ``must be
prohibited from using its ill-gotten gains to buy its way into new
markets and lock in new customers'' by buying up stakes in
technology startups with its ``massive cash hoard.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were divided on what the ruling means for Microsoft,
with some speculating the company would be well served by delaying
a settlement or punishment for as long as possible in hopes of a
presidential victory by Texas Governor George W. Bush, who opposes
a breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   For every month Microsoft can stall the antitrust case with
appeals, others noted, it can cement its position in emerging
markets for software that drives wireless Internet access systems
and other next-generation technologies, cushioning any impact on
its core computer operating system and office software market.
</P>
<P>
   While his November findings of fact described a wide-ranging
pattern of Microsoft punishing competitors and threatening
companies to use its products and shut out rivals', Jackson's
verdict turned on its conduct in the market for Web browsers, the
software Internet surfers use to find and display Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Having initally underestimated how quickly the Net would take
off as a crucial part of Americans' work, shopping and leisure,
Gates pushed Microsoft in 1995 and 1996 to catch up in the market
for Net browsers, then dominated by Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to build a market for its Internet Explorer, however,
Microsoft illegally exploited its monopoly position in computer
operating systems, Jackson ruled. More than 90 percent of the
world's computers use Windows operating systems, by many estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The judge upheld 23 of 26 monopoly misconduct arguments brought
by the states that joined the federal government in bringing the
case 22 months ago, although Jackson found the company not guilty
of ``unlawful exclusive dealing'' in marketing arrangements for
Windows with other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled that Microsoft's efforts to push sales of Internet
explorer and force Windows users to buy the browser amounted to a
clear violation of the 1890 Sherman Act, the same antitrust law
that led to the breakup of the Standard Oil trust 90 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft mounted a deliberate assault upon entrepreneurial
efforts that, left to rise or fall on their own merits, could well
have enabled the introduction of competition into the market'' for
personal computer operating systems that run on Intel-compatible
chips, the judge said in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when the separate categories of conduct are viewed, as
they should be, as a single, well-coordinated course of action does
the full extent of the violence that Microsoft has done to the
competitive process reveal itself,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled that Microsoft's insistence on selling a version
of its Windows operating system that bundled in its Internet
Explorer _ and discouraged consumers from installing Netscape or
other Web browser programs _ ``was the result of a deliberate and
purposeful choice to quell incipient competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Microsoft's share of the Internet browser market has
jumped from about 25 percent to over 60 percent, almost all at the
expense of rival Netscape, which was purchased by America Online
last May in a bid by AOL to hold off a monopoly in browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Top Microsoft executives repeated their mantra that Microsoft
wants to be free to continue to develop innovative products.
</P>
<P>
   Gates asserted that ``this ruling turns on its head the reality
that consumers know: that our software has helped make PCs
accessible and more affordable to millions of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballmer, named the company's CEO last year when Gates took a new
post as chief software architect, said, ``Our intense focus on
moving forward has at times been seen as threatening and our
passion for being the best has been misinterpreted. We can do
better. But that doesn't mean innovating any less or delivering any
less value to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides erasing billions in Microsoft wealth, the stock market
selloff dropped the company from No. 1 last week to No. 3 in total
stock market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   At $472.5 billion at the market close, Microsoft lagged General
Electric, worth $530.5 billion, and Silicon Valley networking giant
Cisco Systems Inc., worth about $506 billion.

MICROSOFT PRESIDENT VOWS TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Ballmer is a famously tough businessman, and he's known
for months that federal judge Thomas Penfield Jackson would issue a
harsh verdict in the Microsoft antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ballmer, the president of Microsoft, is also a man who wears
his feelings on his sleeve. So at a press conference Monday, there
was no mistaking his emotions _ sadness, dismay and a steely
determination to keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intense focus on moving forward has at times been seen as
threatening and our passion for being the best has been
misinterpreted. We can do better,'' Ballmer admitted. For a moment,
he sounded chastened, slightly remorseful. Then he quickly added,
``But that doesn't mean innovating any less or delivering any less
value to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The right to innovate on behalf of customers, no matter how
badly it hurts Microsoft's competitors, has been the company's
battle cry throughout this antitrust case. Monday, Microsoft made
it clear it will continue to make that argument all the way to the
US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And some industry experts say that the company's chances aren't
as bleak as they might at first appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a big setback for Microsoft, but the truth
is the game is far from over,'' said Michael Gartenberg, analyst
for the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. ``Microsoft has had a very
successful track record in fighting negative court rulings in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-known example occurred earlier in the legal wars over
Microsoft's Internet browsing software. In 1998, a federal appeals
court overturned an earlier injunction issued by Jackson in an
attempt to stop Microsoft from including an Internet browser in its
Windows 98 operating system. Even if Microsoft's actions harmed
rival browser maker Netscape Communications Corp., the court said
Microsoft had a right to take such actions if they also benefited
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jackson specifically rejected the appeals court's
ruling. Yet that same court will hear Microsoft's next appeal.
Jackson ``has decided to buck the court he reports to,'' said
Charles Rule, former antitrust chief in the Justice Department and
sometime legal consultant to Microsoft. ``I think there's a real
question whether legally that's a sustainable position.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Microsoft's adversaries see the matter very
differently. ``I don't even understand their argument. You cannot
change the facts,'' said Mike Pettit, executive director of
ProComp, an organization that supports the federal antitrust suit
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit noted that Monday's conclusions of law were based on the
findings of fact issued last year. At almost every point, the
findings agreed with the Justice Department's view that Microsoft
sought to ruthlessly crush rival companies.
</P>
<P>
   These findings of fact were not available to the appeals court
in 1998, when it ruled in favor of Microsoft. Now the court must
take the findings into account when reconsidering the matter, and
findings of fact are rarely overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In Pettit's view, the facts about Microsoft's behavior are so
damning that the appeals court will reverse itself and agree with
Jackson's ruling. ``I don't think they have a leg to stand on, on
appeal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeal won't be coming for a while yet. First, Jackson
must decide on appropriate penalties. That could require several
more months, said Lars Liebeler, an antitrust attorney for the
Computing Technology Industry Association, a group that supports
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states and Justice will want to proceed as quickly as
possible to a remedies stage,'' said Liebeler. But he suggested
Microsoft improves its ultimate chances by delaying the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case itself has demonstrated that the technology sector
can change rapidly,'' said Liebeler. ``The marketplace doesn't look
anything like it looked two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft can drag the case through the courts for a couple
more years, it may be rendered moot, he said. So in that view, the
company has every reason to wait out the penalty phase, then take
its case first to the federal appeals court and perhaps eventually
to the US Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   To Liebeler, it's all a colossal waste of time. He pointed out
that a key witness for the Justice Department, MIT economist
Franklin Fisher, testified that he knew of no evidence that
Microsoft's business practices had harmed the public. ``To me,''
said Liebeler, ``that ended the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how it looks to Connecticut Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal, who sees Jackson's ruling as vindication of his
view that Microsoft has hurt consumers. ``All of the findings point
to the conclusion, and I think it'll be strong on appeal, that
Microsoft engaged in classic anticompetitive behavior,'' Blumenthal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even some stern Microsoft critics think the company may
survive the process intact. Bob Lande, board member of the American
Antitrust Institute, says the wording of Jackson's ruling gives him
hope that Microsoft will be broken up. ``Strong language gives rise
to a strong remedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lande still doubts that Jackson will go that far. ``Judges
rarely break up companies,'' he said. ``Rarely.''

 &HT;    Hazing suspected in fatal wreck
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ A University of Georgia student killed in a auto
wreck last week may have been handcuffed and blindfolded as part of
what Oconee County Sheriff Scott Berry suspects is a fraternity
hazing event.
</P>
<P>
   University officials could not say Monday whether hazing had
been part of the accident Thursday that killed Benjamin Folsom
Grantham III, 20, ``because the investigation isn't complete,''
said UGA communications director Tom Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But UGA President Michael Adams said the school would take
appropriate disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out that's what happened, there'll be some serious
consequences for those involved,'' Jackson added. ``We don't want
to get ahead of the investigation and we want to have all the facts
before we say too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Grantham, who was buried on St. Simons Island on Monday, was
apparently thrown from the cargo hold of a sport utility vehicle
after it struck a tree south of Watkinsville. He was a member of
Alpha Tau Omega _ not a pledge, a fraternity official said.
</P>
<P>
   Before authorities arrived at the scene of the wreck, someone
removed handcuffs from Grantham's wrists, Berry said. But
``handcuffs leave a very distinct mark,'' he said. ``From
information we've received from talking to various people, we
believe it was some kind of hazing incident.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of handcuffs were found at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragic event for us and the members of this
fraternity,'' said Wynn Smiley, executive director of the
Indianapolis-based national ATO organization, who came to the UGA
campus Monday. Smiley was in town to comfort the fraternity
brothers, but also to investigate the circumstances of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will talk with the officers of (ATO), university officials
and possibly the police,'' he said. ``Certainly our prayers go out
to the families.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said ATO members told him there was no organized event
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He said members described Grantham, a transfer student, as ``an
enthusiastic, well-liked member of the fraternity. He seemed an
all-around good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   An Infiniti QX4 SUV and two other cars carrying Alpha Tau Omega
members were traveling west in south Oconee County around 11:45
p.m. when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The two cars allegedly left the accident scene before
authorities arrived, Berry said, and so did the driver of the
Infiniti.
</P>
<P>
   After it leaves Ga. 15, Elder Mill Road changes from pavement to
gravel, and the accident occurred at that transition, Berry said.
The driver of the Infiniti apparently lost control and hit a
sweetgum tree.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia State Patrol is reconstructing the crash, accounting
for time and movement, Berry said. He said the car apparently
flipped over and was so damaged it was difficult to determine
exactly what happened, other than ``it was a dramatic impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of alcohol was found in the SUV and at the scene, Berry
said. Blood alcohol tests on occupants of the SUV were sent to the
State Crime Lab for evaluation. Results were not back Monday, said
Allison Hodge of the Georgia State Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Although Berry said he didn't know how fast the SUV was going
when it wrecked, he was certain it was traveling along the
woods-lined road much faster than the posted speed limit of 25 mph.
The sheriff got to the scene about 20 minutes after the accident
and helped carry Grantham out of the ditch where he was lying, with
injuries to his head and chest. Grantham was transported to St.
Mary's Hospital in Athens, and died early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Dailey, 18, of Dalton, also had been ejected and was taken
to St. Mary's, where he remained in serious condition Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the vehicle, Walter David Penn, 20, of Marietta,
wasn't at the scene but went to St. Mary's with injuries, Berry
said. Penn was listed in fair condition Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Berry said he saw two other passengers walking around,
apparently uninjured. He declined to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mullendore, UGA vice president for student affairs, said
the university's first priority is to work with the families of the
injured students and Grantham. He said there is much grieving on
campus, since five other students have died of various causes this
semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``We join the Grantham family and Ben's many friends in mourning
his loss,'' Adams said in a written statement. ``If we learn
anything in such a dark moment, it is that pranks and fun and
foolishness are not always harmless. From the perspective of the
university's student and organizational conduct codes, if there is
responsibility to be assigned and disciplinary action to be taken,
it will be done in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   ATO is ``your average, run-of-the-mill fraternity, no different
from many others,'' said UGA Assistant Police Chief Jimmy
Williamson. Its last run-in with the UGA Student Judiciary was in
the spring of 1995, when it was placed on social probation for a
quarter, after a female guest fell into a hole that had been dug
for a mud volleyball event.

RIVALS RENEW CALLS TO BREAKUP MICROSOFT
</HEADLINE>
   (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(nk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF and MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Reinvigorated by Monday's ruling in the
Microsoft antitrust case, Microsoft Corp.'s competitors in Silicon
Valley on Monday renewed their calls for harsh ``structural''
sanctions that would lead to the break-up of the nation's largest
independent software company.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in the debate away from so-called conduct remedies,
which would have regulated or restricted Microsoft's market power
but would have left the company intact, came after negotiations
between the Justice Department, states attorneys general and
Microsoft fell apart on Saturday.

   ``I've talked to several people today, and others are feeling
this way,'' said James Barksdale, the former chief executive of
Netscape Communications Corp., who testified against Microsoft
during the antitrust trial last year. ``I testified for a
structural resolution at the trial, and I think the judge would be
disposed to it. In many ways it is the simplest solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling that more extreme remedies might now be likely was
mirrored Monday at Enterprise 2000, an Internet business conference
in Monterey, Calif., attended by several hundred Silicon Valley
venture capitalists and business executives.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to vote electronically on what remedies would be most
appropriate, 46 percent voted that Microsoft should be broken up,
while only 30 percent voted that the company should be fined $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our discussions we realized the conduct remedies are like
Swiss cheese,'' said Ed Black, president of the Computer &AMP;
Communication Industry Association. ``The uncertainty is off the
table, and the government has to put forth a credible remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of the Valley's leading executives and venture
capitalists led by Sun Microsystems Chairman Scott McNealy and
Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison are quietly orchestrating a
movement to develop a new set of structural remedies that would
break up Microsoft or simply spin off part of the company.
</P>
<P>
   McNealy, a public and bitter opponent of Microsoft, suggested
over the weekend that his company's legal battle with Microsoft
over the Java language might expand after Monday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put yourself in the seat of the CEO of Sun Microsystems,''
McNealy said. ``Every time we sign a deal, they go in behind us and
make an investment. It's beyond blatant. Cash is the most fungible
tool in a monopolist's arsenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and executives argue that
anything short of structural remedies would enable Microsoft to
forestall or litigate its way out of a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without structural remedies, it's hard to imagine Microsoft
isn't going to find a way to keep dodging the bullet,'' said Tim
O'Reilly, chief executive of O'Reilly &AMP; Associates, a publisher of
computer books.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, O'Reilly said he believed that the decision
comes when Microsoft is in a ``weaker position than they've ever
been'' because it faces real competition from Web-based businesses
that are providing consumers Internet-based alternatives to the
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Other Microsoft rivals from the Valley said they were not
committed to any particular type of remedy but felt that the
company's competitive abuses must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This establishes what everyone already knew,'' said Jerry
Fidler, chairman and co-founder of Wind River Systems Inc., a maker
of operating systems based in Alameda, Calif. ``Now we have an
opportunity to fix the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts have said that the language of the decision
could encourage potential litigants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just opens the door to a multitude of private lawsuits,''
said Jack Russo, an intellectual property lawyer in Palo Alto,
Calif. ``This litigation could end up looking a lot like the
tobacco industry, with a lot of lawyer time and a big legal process
for Microsoft to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   Frequently overlooked, however, among the strong anti-Microsoft
sentiments, is is that the software publisher still has many
friends and allies in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the I-hate-Bill club gets the government to do their heavy
lifting for them, they will come to regret it in the form of new
and objectionable regulations,'' said Alan Cooper, president of
Cooper Interaction Design, a software design firm based in Palo
Alto. ``Our federal government and our justice department doesn't
have an understanding of the digital universe and is
miscomprehending it. There actions will backfire.''

RIVALS RENEW CALLS TO BREAKUP MICROSOFT

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Reinvigorated by Monday's ruling in the
Microsoft antitrust case, Microsoft Corp.'s competitors in Silicon
Valley on Monday renewed their calls for harsh ``structural''
sanctions that would lead to the break-up of the nation's largest
independent software company.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in the debate away from so-called conduct remedies,
which would have regulated or restricted Microsoft's market power
but would have left the company intact, came after negotiations
between the Justice Department, states attorneys general and
Microsoft fell apart on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to several people today, and others are feeling

 &HT;    Gore vows to close high-tech gap
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vice President Al Gore talked in Atlanta on Monday
about getting technology into the hands of those who can't afford
it, then turned to fund-raising among those who can afford the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers and an Internet hookup are as vital to education in
this century as a blackboard and chalk were in the last
generation,'' Gore said to students and civil rights group members
at Morehouse College.
</P>
<P>
   For about 30 minutes in the King Chapel, the vice president
outlined plans to bring about ``truly revolutionary'' changes in
education. Most of his ideas involved high-tech changes. Gore said
the government has to lead the way in closing the so-called digital
divide _ the difference between the computer and technology access
of the haves and the have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive Democratic nominee for president outlined his
plans for getting more computers into American homes and schools
and providing better training in future technology, especially
among low-income groups that are behind the technological wave.
</P>
<P>
   He proposed making the Internet accessible in every school and
library by the end of his first term to create technology centers
for students and adults in poor rural and urban communities.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed creating classes to ensure that all students
are computer-proficient by eighth grade, putting 75,000 new
teachers into schools nationwide, and starting a program for
tax-free college savings.
</P>
<P>
   But it was definitely the ``haves'' who spent the latter part of
the evening with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After the hourlong forum, Gore was the highlight of a Democratic
National Committee fund-raiser at an Atlanta home, where the going
rate for entry was $100,000 a couple.
</P>
<P>
   The event, at the home of oncologist Larry Cooper, was expected
to raise just under $2 million for the DNC, with about 7.5 percent
of that going to the Georgia Democratic Party to aid in local and
state level races. By contrast, a DNC fund-raiser featuring
President Clinton last fall was just $5,000 per couple.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's quick fly-in _ Gore departed later in the evening for
Philadelphia _ was his first visit since the vice president swept
Georgia's March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of most of Georgia's Democratic leaders, Gore
carried 84 percent of the state vote against an almost nonexistent
campaign by former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials hailed the visit as an indication
that Georgia, overshadowed amid 15 other primaries and caucuses in
March, will play a more important roll in the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be a lot more visits between now and
November,'' said David Worley, Georgia Democratic Party chairman.
``We have every expectation that Georgia will be a targeted state
in the fall.''

ULTIMATELY, MICROSOFT CASE A LONG WAY FROM BEING DECIDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: the 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:45 p.m. ET; this is
now an A1 story, with MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(rk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Joel I. Klein filed the government's antitrust
case against Microsoft Corp. nearly two years ago, he sent courtesy
copies of the 53-page legal complaint to a number of appellate and
Supreme Court judges.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of
the antitrust division, appeared to reflect the Justice
Department's judgment that _ for all of the importance of the trial
before U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson _ the fate of
the case would ultimately be in the hands of a higher authority.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Jackson issued his long-awaited conclusions of law, and
it was clear from both the scope and tone of the decision that the
judge shared Klein's strategic vision about the importance of
trying to build legal arguments that could survive appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While the judge's sweeping factual conclusions last November
that Microsoft was a monopolist had practically guaranteed a ruling
that the company had violated federal antitrust law, the decision
Monday was somewhat more measured than anticipated. Rather than
take a blunderbuss approach, Jackson accepted two of the central
tenets of the government's case and rejected a third.
</P>
<P>
   He also took on a federal appeals court on a central issue in
the case, involving the tying of Microsoft's Windows operating
system with its Internet Explorer web browser. The judge said that
a three-judge appeals panel had overlooked Supreme Court precedent
in 1998 when it reversed him at the outset of the Microsoft
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly endearing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia that will also hear the appeal in the latest case, the
comments by Jackson may ultimately find a more receptive audience
at the high court. But at the same time they are almost certain to
be seized by Microsoft as an example of how Jackson is unable to
follow the instructions of the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court in Washington is often deeply polarized
over high-profile legal issues, and it is difficult to predict how
it will react to Jackson's decision. Indeed the last Microsoft
appeal in the case split one panel, 2-1. That legal uncertainty, in
fact, may ultimately spark further settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   Even before it reaches the appellate stage, Jackson's
conclusions that Microsoft repeatedly violated the Sherman
Antitrust Act may add new impetus for the government to seek to
have its proposed remedies imposed on Microsoft even before the
case reaches the appellate stage. Government officials Monday
declined to discuss what remedies they would propose. Nor would
they discuss whether the government would oppose an effort by
Microsoft to have any remedies postponed until after the case is
reviewed by higher courts, a process that may take another two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meanwhile, Jackson's reasoning gives him broad latitude
to impose almost any kind of remedy he may see fit. As he now
begins preparing a schedule for the final phase of the case in his
courtroom, Monday's decision could be used to justify anything from
imposing tough new restrictions on Microsoft executives to breaking
up the company into several pieces, as several of the attorneys
general representing states have advocated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department now has to almost certainly at a minimum offer
a plan to break up the company,'' said Robert E. Litan, a former
top antitrust official at the Justice Department who is now the
director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Other antitrust experts following the case predicted that the
government would offer breaking up the company as one of several
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   In failing to reach a settlement over the weekend, Microsoft is
wagering that either it will once again find a more sympathetic
appeals court bench, or that advances in technology will largely
make the case moot. Indeed, if the case takes several years to
reach a conclusion, any remedy short of a breakup of the company
could prove largely irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The company may also benefit from a change in the White House
since Gov. George W. Bush, the expected Republican candidate for
president, has suggested that antitrust enforcement should be
confined mainly to price-fixing cases.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's decision will make it more difficult politically
for any new administration to simply drop the case. And for the
time being, Microsoft executives will continue to have to contend
with Jackson's powerful findings that the company repeatedly
violated the Sherman Act.
</P>
<P>
   Any one of the judge's legal conclusions could lead to a severe
punishment for Microsoft. Taken all together, they invite the state
and federal governments to ask the judge to have the company split
up just as AT&AMP;T was nearly a generation ago and as the Standard Oil
Co. was early in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and other government officials
seemed delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has been held accountable for its illegal conduct by
a court of law,'' the attorney general said. ``We are pleased that
the court agreed with the department that Microsoft abused its
monopoly power, that it violated the antitrust laws and that it
harmed consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Miller, the attorney general of Iowa, said, ``Judge
Jackson's decision is a broad-based and compelling finding of
liability, of law-breaking.'' Miller leads the efforts of the 19
states that are partners with the Justice Department in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The suit against Microsoft was filed almost two years ago,
charging the company with using a monopoly in personal-computer
operating systems to stifle innovation and bully competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The trial opened in October 1998, and from the opening moments,
the government presented a case that embarrassed and damaged
Microsoft. Then, when the company offered its own case several
months later, many of Microsoft's witnesses were humiliated on the
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony ended last spring. And when the judge issued his
findings of fact last November, he found that Microsoft had
``demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and
immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing
initiatives that could intensify competition against one of
Microsoft's core products.''
</P>
<P>
   With those findings, everyone involved with the case realized
that his final judgment _ which would be called a verdict in a
criminal case _ was likely to fall heavily against Microsoft, as it
did Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many lawyers were less certain that the judge would rule
the company in violation of the provision of the Sherman Act that
bears on combining one product with another.
</P>
<P>
   A central conclusion in the government's charges _ and in the
judge's findings of fact _ was that Microsoft tied its Web browser
to the Windows operating system to gain market share for its
browser and put Netscape at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   But a finding of fact does not necessarily lead to a similar
conclusion of law, which says that the action violates antitrust
laws. That is particularly so in this case because a three-judge
panel of the Court of Appeals, overturning an order by Jackson
requiring Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without the
browser, decided 2-in 1998 that Microsoft had every right to tie
the browser to the operating system, if the company could
demonstrate a plausible consumer benefit from the combination.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court judges also suggested, however, that their
opinion might change once they saw the evidence record from a
trial. Jackson devoted the largest section of his ruling to
defending his judgment of liability on this count.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals opinion, he wrote, ``appears to immunize
any product design (or at least software product design) from
antitrust scrutiny, irrespective of its effect upon competition, if
the software developer can postulate any `plausible claim' of
advantage to its arrangement of code.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited several Supreme Court decisions that support his view
and called them ``indisputably controlling.'' He concluded:
``Microsoft's decision to tie Internet Explorer to Windows cannot
truly be explained as an attempt to benefit consumers and improve
the efficiency of the software market generally, but rather as part
of a larger campaign to quash innovation that threatened its
monopoly position.''
</P>
<P>
   On other counts, he ruled that Microsoft's campaign against
Netscape, as well as its decision to develop its own version of the
Java programming language and encourage other companies to use it
instead of the authorized version, prevented Netscape and Java from
competing on the merits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Microsoft achieved this result through exclusionary
acts that lacked procompetitive justification,'' the judge wrote,
``the court deems Microsoft's conduct the maintenance of monopoly
power by anticompetitive means.''
</P>
<P>
   He found in favor of Microsoft on the charge that the company
had tried to block Netscape from the market by making exclusive
agreements for its browser with computer companies, online services
and Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wrote: ``The evidence does not support a finding that
these agreements completely excluded Netscape from any constituent
portion of the worldwide browser market,'' as the law requires for
a finding of illegality.
</P>
<P>
   But the heavy weight of the ruling was against Microsoft, and it
included some extraordinarily damning language in parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's anticompetitive actions,'' he wrote, ``trammeled
the competitive process through which the computer software
industry generally stimulates innovation'' to ``the optimum benefit
of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said the ruling made it likely that the government
would ask for a remedy breaking up the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boxes them in,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior
official in the Justice Department's antitrust division who dealt
with the department's last suit against Microsoft, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In the mediation effort that ended on Saturday, ``Microsoft
already made it clear that they would not accept a conduct remedy''
acceptable to the government, he said. And this suggests that, if
one were imposed, the government might face difficult enforcement
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this strong validation of the case, we now know that only
a breakup will address the operating system monopoly'' that is at
the heart of the case, Litan said. He is now with the Brookings
Institution and has said he favors breaking up the company into
several autonomous parts.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, representatives of both Microsoft and the
government said they remained open to the idea of restarting
settlement talks. But when the judge's decision was entered,
Microsoft's options narrowed considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact in November gave plaintiffs' lawyers
who were pursuing private suits against Microsoft useful ammunition
for their cases. But the findings had only an ambiguous legal
standing without the conclusions of law, entered Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of Microsoft's strongest incentives for reaching a
settlement before Monday was that it would have removed the threat
of a legal ruling and vacated the findings of fact. But should the
litigants reach a settlement in the weeks or months ahead, it is
not at all clear that the decision, including its legal conclusion
that Microsoft holds a monopoly in personal computer operating
systems, can be wiped from the records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting and unsure question,'' said Andrew I.
Gavil, a professor of law at Howard University. ``There's no clear
precedent for vacating a ruling after it has been issued.'' But
even if Jackson were to agree to vacate his ruling as a condition
of a settlement agreement, Gavil noted that other judges might not
feel bound by that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the ruling is entered, you lose containment,'' he said.
``There's no guarantee that another judge in another district where
a suit is being tried would agree that the ruling is withdrawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Gavil and other lawyers said they believed that private suits
against Microsoft would multiply, beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives powerful new ammunition to lawyers pursuing
class-action cases,'' said Stephen Houck, who was the chief lawyer
for the 19 states that filed suit against Microsoft. He is now in
private practice. Gavil added, ``I think we may well see a new wave
of them.

TEEN SHOT BY PIRATES RECOVERING IN DALLAS HOSPITAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It is a story that seems out of place in the
Information age: A Dutch family sailing the globe is attacked by
pirates off the coast of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is because of technology that all members of the van
Tuijl family were able to share the details of their harrowing
ordeal at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The family spoke at the Children's Medical Center in Dallas
where 13-year-old Willem van Tuijl is recovering from a gunshot
wound that left him paralyzed from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   The van Tuijls were saved by ham radio operators who put them in
touch with a Miami doctor who talked them through the medical care
of their son. The amateur operators also steered the family to
Children's Medical Center, which sent a Lear jet to Honduras to
pick them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had not been for them, he probably would have died,''
Jannie van Tuijl said.
</P>
<P>
   The saga began more than a week ago when the van Tuijls, who
have been sailing around the world since 1995, anchored their
steel, 44-foot sailboat near Half Moon Reef in the Atlantic Ocean
about 50 miles from Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Jacco van Trujl and his son launched an inflatable dinghy to
visit another sailboat anchored nearby and to fish the reef a few
hundred yards from their yacht.
</P>
<P>
   While they were gone, Jannie van Tuijl said an open wooden boat
similar to the kind used by Honduran fishermen pulled alongside
their yacht. Four men pulled out AK-47 assault rifles and boarded.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded nothing but ``papers,'' she said. She pretended
not to understand Spanish. Recognizing that something was wrong,
Jacco van Tuijl turned the dinghy toward the yacht.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started screaming, `Please go back, go back,' '' she said.
``He turned the boat and they were already shooting.``
</P>
<P>
   At first, she said, the men fired into the air. Then she saw her
son lurch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Willem collapse in slow motion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bullet entered his right side, ripped through a kidney,
intestines and spine and exited through his left kidney,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The same bullet punctured and deflated the dinghy, tossing
father and son into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel my legs anymore,'' the boy told his father.
</P>
<P>
   While Willem clung to him, Jacco van Tuijl swam to the yacht,
where his wife had already sent out a distress call.
</P>
<P>
   For five hours, the mother pressed her hand against her son's
wounds in an attempt to stop the bleeding. He was remarkably calm,
she said. He never cried and kept assuring her that ``everything
will be all right.``
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Willem said, ``I'm so happy that they shot me,
Mom.``
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you say that?'' she asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if they had shot one of you, I would have died from
sadness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly 20 hours for help to arrive and take the boy to a
hospital in Honduras. During that time, the parents were in
constant contact with Dr. Jim Hirschman, a Miami doctor and ham
radio operator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid he was going to die any minute,'' Hirschman told
The Associated Press. ``It grieved me that we had so many hours to
go and no way to relieve the boys suffering.``
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a wheelchair in his hospital room Monday, Willem said
the pain was not great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just BOOM and my legs were feeling like they're not
there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The van Tuijls said they have had no communication with Honduran
authorities and have know idea who the assailants were or what
motivated the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might have wanted to steal the boat for drug transport
but not kill us yet,'' Jacco van Tuijl speculated. ``They would
have needed us to get the boat where they wanted it. That's just a
theory. What they exactly wanted, we don't know.``
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the family has logged more than 40,000 miles at sea,
van Tuijl said, and had planned to make the boat their permanent
home. Now, they may return to the Netherlands and settle on land.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that he will never walk again, Willem said, ``I would like
to have as close as possible to an ordinary life ... have fun ...
be with my family.``
</P>
<P>
   He was listed in fair condition, but a hospital spokeswoman said
he will be at Children's for an indefinite stay.

   During  &UR; Julia Butterfly Hill &LR; 's two-year stay in the branches of
Luna, a 1,000-year-old redwood tree in Humboldt County, she
entertained several celebrity guests. One of them, she writes in
her new memoir, ``The Legacy of Luna'' (HarperSan Francisco; $25),

about how he got involved, about his family. We stayed up half the
night.''

<P>
   Harrelson decided to sleep over in the tree. ``I didn't have
that many blankets,'' writes Hill, ``and it was extremely cold and
windy, but I did my best to make him comfortable by giving him half
my covers. Neither of us stayed very warm, but I was more used to
the cold than he was.

   ``He had difficulty with the sparse situation, and when the

a personal assistant to handle things as you do!'''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson apologized and admitted being ``a little spoiled.''

 &HT;    Turner Field looks at `AL' strike zone
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Monday delivered him to a new dressing room in a new
park in a new league, and yet when the new guy took the field, who
knew?
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in the major leagues was the game's new umpiring
arrangement more evident than at Turner Field, where 17-year
American League umpire John Hirschbeck, president of the new World
Umpires Association, worked the plate in his first NL game. And
before anyone takes issue with the eight called strikeouts between
two of the freer-swinging teams in the game, the ump has a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' he said, ``it gives you something to write about.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually not. Atlanta's first experience with the game's new
interleague umpiring crews passed without major incident.
Hirschbeck and AL rookie ump Jim Reynolds joined NL veterans
Charlie Williams and Mark Wegner for the Braves' opening series,
just as mixed crews worked every park.
</P>
<P>
   Of 17 crews, nine this season are split 2-2 between AL and NL
umpires while the other eight have one league-crosser. They wore
generic MLB patches on their caps and right sleeves (the official
new uniforms debut in a few months), and if the strike zone did not
seem as generic, Hirschbeck has this thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys have a tighter strike zone, but if the ball is over
the plate at the right height, that's a strike no matter who you
are,'' he said. ``You're talking about a half-inch outside, a half
on the inside. Up and down, the same thing. Some guys are a little
tighter. They want that ball, in their minds, to be right on the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other guys say that if it nicks the corner, that's good enough
for me. That's the only difference in the strike zone. It's really
not an American- National League thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with Javy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be good,'' the Braves catcher said. ``I like
it because people complain too much about our pitchers' location.
The American League umpires, that doesn't bother them.''
</P>
<P>
   The new union is working under a one-year agreement reached 11
days ago after it was determined a more comprehensive agreement
couldn't be completed in time. In theory, there are still AL and NL
umpires, but the distinction will vanish once the new contract is
settled.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under one umbrella is good, but the way the game is played is
different,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``I've been
in both leagues; it's a different style of game. I don't think they
have to make all the umpires the same.''
</P>
<P>
   They're not, or not officially. Unlike last year, clubs will not
evaluate plate umpiring nightly for an MLB survery. While Sandy
Alderson, MLB's director of operations, says the high strike could
be called more regularly, the commissioner's office issued no
strike zone directive this spring, as it did in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mixing of crews, after the growing pains take
place, will be a benefit,'' Braves GM John Schuerholz said. ``They
will be able to reduce the travel. It just makes a lot more sense
for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I also believe that whatever the disparity about the
differences in the two leagues with regards to the strike zone
especially, either from a reality standpoint or from an imagination
standpoint, will be diminished and then eliminated.''

NLRB ALLOWS GRADUATE STUDENTS AT NYU TO UNIONIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KAREN W. ARENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a ruling that some say could alter the
relationship between graduate students and their professors at
private colleges and universities across the United States, a
regional director for the National Labor Relations Board ruled
Monday that graduate students who work as teaching and research
assistants at New York University may organize a union.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by Daniel Silverman, the board's regional director
for the New York region, is the first to allow graduate student
employees at a private university to unionize. Public universities
are subject to state labor laws, and graduate students at many
campuses _ including the State University of New York, the City
University of New York and the University of California _ already
belong to unions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision, which covers 1,700 of NYU's 17,000 graduate
students, clears the way for them to vote on whether to join the
United Auto Workers. If a union is approved, the students will be
able to negotiate wages, benefits and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But NYU, which, like most universities, relies significantly on
graduate student labor, could appeal the decision to the labor
board in Washington. University officials said Monday that they
were ``disappointed'' by the decision and would discuss whether to
appeal with the faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling may raise real problems for the way in which
graduate education can proceed,'' said Robert Berne, the vice
president for academic development. ``To me, it is a chilling
message that faculty members may not be able to talk to their
graduate assistants about their assistanceships without going
through a union representative,'' he added. ``If that is the case,
it can't help but detract from the significant relationship that
faculty members develop with their graduate assistants.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduate students and union officials, however, called such
comments scare tactics and applauded the decision. ``It is very
clear to me that what we do here is work, and like any other
workers, we should be able to take an active role in setting our
working conditions,'' said Kimberly Johnson, a fifth-year graduate
student in American Studies who helped organize the union campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who has helped teach introductory courses in
metropolitan studies and in women's studies, said that her
responsibilities varied greatly from semester to semester, and
included everything from teaching and grading papers to writing a
newsletter, buying books and photocopying materials.
</P>
<P>
   And Lisa Jessup, the UAW organizer who ran the campaign, said
she believes that the decision ``really opens the door for graduate
employees at all private universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the graduate students still must vote, Jessup and
Johnson both expressed confidence that they would win. If the
university appeals, Silverman, the NLRB regional director, said
that the labor relations board could postpone the election until it
rules or let the election proceed, then either count the ballots or
temporarily impound them.
</P>
<P>
   Many colleges and universities rely extensively on graduate
students to carry a significant share of undergraduate teaching;
typically, graduate students lead discussion sessions in large
lecture courses, grade papers and tests, and sometimes run actual
courses. They also help conduct research and assist in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, the terms governing their work, like most
other matters within academia, were largely determined by
university officials. Those terms vary from campus to campus, but
often involve a tuition subsidy additional stipend that account for
a large part of graduate student financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   In decisions more than 20 years ago, the NLRB said that although
graduate students earned money by teaching and conducting research,
those activities represented a small portion of their role as
graduate students. Unionization would intrude on the academic
process, the board said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the ruling Monday, Silverman wrote that while NYU said
the graduate teaching program was run for the benefit of the
graduate students, it was clear that the teaching assistants ``play
a large role in the undergraduate experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,700 graduate students employed as teaching, research or
other assistants, about half are in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences. The Stern School of Business, the School of Education and
the Tisch School of the Arts also employ large numbers. Some
departments require service as a teaching assistant for all of
their doctoral students.
</P>
<P>
   While graduate students talk about higher wages and health care
benefits, university officials say they are most concerned about
the bargaining impinging on academic considerations, like class
sizes or what to teach. ``It is almost impossible to draw the line
between what we consider academic issues and what they consider
work issues,'' Berne said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Yale University, where graduate students have
attempted to organize for several years, also voiced dismay about
the decision. ``If left standing,'' said Richard C. Levin, Yale's
president, in a statement, ``it could bring national labor policy
into conflict with a national educational policy that has for
decades promoted the international leadership of America's graduate
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, called the
decision part of a national trend ``among student employees seeking
respect and dignity on the job.''

JUDGE'S DECISION CAME AFTER 4 MONTHS OF UNSUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT
TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the four months of settlement talks, Microsoft and the
Justice Department prepared 19 proposals and counterproposals
dealing with fine points of software in the technical parlance of
``source code'' and ``application program interfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives say they were finishing a reply to the
Justice Department's latest offer when the federal judge acting as
mediator halted the talks on Saturday. At that point, the two sides
had moved toward agreement on some elements but were still apart on
others, according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department proposal on the table, people familiar
with the discussions said, would have modified a range of
Microsoft's business activities, from its contract deals to sharing
information about its technology more openly with personal computer
makers and software makers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the proposal not only left Microsoft intact but, it seemed,
would not fundamentally alter the way the company does business.
Several of the 19 states joining in the suit protested to the
Justice Department and to the mediator, Judge Richard A. Posner,
that the proposal left Microsoft too many loopholes and lacked
sufficient enforcement mechanisms. And industry executives who were
read a summary said it was too weak to loosen Microsoft's grip on
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the states were overreacting and
that the industry executives were not shown all the provisions. But
one person close to the talks characterized the Justice Department
proposal as a ``65 percent solution'' and one that could be
``fairly criticized as not serious enough.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did Microsoft resist it? One key reason is apparently
that Microsoft viewed contract restrictions in the proposal as
limiting its freedom to add new technology freely to its
industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives did not discuss precise details of the
confidential settlement talks. But in interviews over the weekend,
Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, and William Neukom, the
company's general counsel, repeatedly alluded to that point.
</P>
<P>
   In the antitrust case, the government alleged _ and Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson agreed in his ruling Monday _ that Microsoft
illegally bundled its software for browsing the Internet to its
monopoly product, Windows, to stifle competition from Internet
software. Microsoft denied the charge, saying that it has the sole
discretion to determine what technology is included in its
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental issue in this case was whether we could
support Internet access in Windows,'' Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft points to a 1998 federal appeals court decision in
a related case that found that the company could bundle browsing
software into Windows as long as it could make some ``plausible''
claim of consumer benefit or business efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, Gates noted that ruling and applauded
its sentiment in detailing the stand of principle he insists that
Microsoft is making in continuing to fight the antitrust case in
court. ``We want to be free to put new things into Windows,'' he
said. ``The judiciary should never be involved in designing
software.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates pointed to speech-recognition software as the kind of new
technology that might reasonably be bundled into future generations
of Windows. At present, speech recognition software is an
application product, sold separately, made by companies including
Dragon Systems and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Before Microsoft bundled its browsing software into Windows, the
browser pioneer, Netscape Communications Corp., had a sizable
business in the browser market. But after Microsoft put browsing
into Windows and gave it away free, the separate market for
browsing software withered.
</P>
<P>
   Speech recognition software, say industry analysts and antitrust
experts, may be the next test for Microsoft's bundling strategy.
``The policy goal for the government in a settlement or through
court-ordered remedies is to try to insure that what happened to
Netscape will not happen in another major new product area,'' said
Mark Popofsky, a former Justice Department attorney who worked on
the Microsoft case, and who is now a partner at Kaye Scholer
Fierman Hays &AMP; Handler.

 WASHINGTON: 20th century.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judge concluded, for instance, that Microsoft maintained its
monopoly power over operating software through anti-competitive
means, ruthlessly striving over a four-year period to crush any
potential threat to its domination over operating system software.
He also found that the company tried to monopolize the market for
Internet browsers in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, Microsoft mounted a deliberate assault upon
entrepreneurial efforts that, left to rise or fall on their own
merits, could well have enabled the introduction of competition
into the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems,'' the
judge wrote. ``While the evidence does not prove that they would
have succeeded absent Microsoft's actions, it does reveal that
Microsoft placed an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive
fortune, thereby effectively guaranteeing its continued dominance
in the relevant market. More broadly, Microsoft's anti-competitive
actions trammeled the competitive process through which the
computer software industry generally stimulates innovation and
conduces to the optimum benefit of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Handing a small bone to Microsoft, Jackson dismissed the
government's claims that the company's marketing arrangements with
other companies like Compaq and Apple Computer had violated Section
1 of the Act.
</P>
<P>
   But on a fourth major issue, one on which an appeals court had
previously reversed him and ruled in Microsoft's favor, the judge
was unyielding even to his superiors. Instead, he took the highly
unusual position for a lower court judge of both criticizing and
dismissing the appellate court decision.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals decision, issued a month after the current case was
filed, is one of Microsoft's strongest legal defenses. When it was
handed down, it forced the government to broadly expand the case.
The appeals judges lifted an injunction imposed by Jackson after
they found that Microsoft had not violated the Sherman Act by
bundling its Windows operating system with its Internet Explorer
software.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also set a high standard for the government to
make a successful case under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. It said
that Microsoft should be free to blend its Web browser into Windows
as long as it could make a ``plausible claim'' of business
efficiency or consumer benefit from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson Monday called the appeals opinion ``inconsistent
with the pertinent Supreme Court precedents'' and ``not formally
binding.'' Using one of the law's cruelest Latin cuts, he called
the appeals court's reasoning ``obiter dicta,'' or surplus language
peripheral to a decision and therefore of no legal consequence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read literally, the D.C. Circuit's opinion appears to immunize
any product design (or, at least, software product design) from
antitrust scrutiny, irrespective of its effect upon competition, if
the software developer can postulate any `plausible claim' of
advantage to its arrangement of code,'' Jackson wrote. ``This
undemanding test appears to this court to be inconsistent with the
pertinent Supreme Court precedents.''

 &HT;    Big Cat's back, back, back
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Using Opening Day as his stage, Andres Galarraga took
all of three at-bats to give Braves fans an idea of how his return
from a yearlong bout with lymphoma was going.
</P>
<P>
   As in going, going gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Comeback Cat hit a home run off Pedro Astacio in the seventh
inning and made the defensive play that was the difference,
smothering an Astacio shot up the line to save at least two runs
and carry the Braves to a 2-0 victory against the Colorado Rockies
in front of 42,255 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   That and Greg Maddux made the Braves winners on Opening Day for
the seventh time in the past nine years. Maddux, who handed the
shutout over to Mike Remlinger two outs into the eighth inning, was
happy to concede the day to the ``Big Cat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was cool,'' Maddux said. ``You want to stand up and start
clapping, too. The road he had to go through to get back, and to do
that? The game-winning RBI, save two, three runs with his glove.
Plus he's one of the guys you root for. It's great to see, it
really was.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga ended a defensive standoff in which outstanding plays
were swapped. Diving catch by Andruw Jones. Running catch by
Colorado's Tom Goodwin. Bare-handed play on an infield chop by Jeff
Cirillo. Over-the-shoulder catch by the Braves' Reggie Sanders.
Then Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   He rescued Maddux from a bases-loaded jam with his stellar grab
to take a hit away from Astacio, who'd driven a Maddux pitch down
the line with two out in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the bat back in his hands in the bottom of the seventh,
Galarraga, who'd been hit by a pitch and struck out, sent a 1-0 low
fastball from Astacio high into an orbit that ended in the
left-center-field seats for his first home run since Sept. 23,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave Andruw Jones some ideas. Jones took an Astacio
pitch over the left-field fence two pitches later to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of things happen to me great in my career, but
today is something special,'' Galarraga said. ``It's like a movie.
Believe me, I don't have the words to say how happy I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga had been getting the Braves' attention since his first
day of camp, but even those who saw him hit .347 with three home
runs this spring were overwhelmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable how things work out, almost like magic,''
manager Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   The day was magical all around for the Braves. They got the game
in despite threatening weather. They eased some bullpen worries
while John Rocker is unavailable by sending out Remlinger, who got
four outs for the save.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was that one. One Galarraga home run and
counting.
</P>
<P>
   As shortstop Walt Weiss put it, ``The story just keeps getting
better and better.''

MONEY ADVISER TO THE STARS FACES CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As recently as a year ago, Dana C. Giacchetto was an
investment adviser to the stars, counting actors, rock bands and
artists among his clients. He moved in a world of high-powered
entertainment deals, and his boyish face stared from the pages of
national magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But his small investment company began losing a string of
clients during the winter, and in March federal agents searched his
home and office. Monday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged
that Giacchetto, 37, looted more than $6 million from clients and
lied to securities investigators about financial problems at his
company, the Cassandra Group.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors would not identify which clients lost
money, Giacchetto, who was charged with stock fraud, has listed
Matt Damon, Ben Stiller and the rock group Phish among his
clientele, according to records filed in court. Giacchetto's
company managed more than $100 million for 305 clients in 1999,
according to records filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Monday, a federal judge granted a request by securities
officials to freeze his company's assets.
</P>
<P>
   SEC lawyers said Giacchetto billed himself as a safe and
conservative money manager to appeal to artists and entertainers
who had considerable wealth but lacked financial sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   The company's brochures said the Cassandra Group never had
direct custody of its clients' money, and therefore ``assures the
client security of his or her account.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company deposited the money with a separate
company.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto was allowed to make stock trades with the money, but
he was never supposed to take custody of the money.
</P>
<P>
   But Giacchetto did not abide by the terms of the bargain,
federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York said.
</P>
<P>
   They said from 1997 until March 20, 2000, Giacchetto improperly
transferred $20 million from his clients' bank accounts into his
company's accounts. Once it was there, prosecutors charged,
Giacchetto took about $6 million in various ways. He used some of
the money to pay Cassandra's business expenses, and other money to
pay his bills, including travel, dining and rent at his Manhattan
loft, the prosecutors said. Other money was used to repay clients
whose money had previously been taken, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Giacchetto, who did not appear in court, was out of the country
Monday and was expected to return Tuesday, his lawyer, Andrew J.
Levander, said.
</P>
<P>
   Levander would not comment on the criminal case, saying he has
not had a chance to speak with his client or fully read the
documents. If convicted on all charges, Giacchetto would face up to
10 years in federal prison.

 &HT;    Evolution: Augusta adapts to high-tech game
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Augusta National has undergone several face-lifts
during its history, but recent changes have some of the top players
grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tiger Woods' runaway victory in 1997, officials have
lengthened several holes, planted, replanted and moved trees,
enlarged and changed the contours of the greens and added rough.
</P>
<P>
   Hootie Johnson, chairman of the Masters tournament, explained
that change always has been a constant at Augusta National. But the
purists complain that officials are beginning to distance
themselves from the philosophy of course co-creators Bobby Jones
and Alister Mackenzie that simplicity can offer a stern test in
golf.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jack Nicklaus, a six-time Masters champion, said he thinks
officials crossed the line in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what they've done to the golf course at all,''
said Nicklaus, who missed last year's tournament while recovering
from hip replacement surgery. ``They've taken a golf course that
played for years a certain way and now they've eliminated that. I
was in favor of them putting in light rough, but I didn't realize
they did what they did. It looks like somebody who doesn't play
golf or understand the game did it. And I've never said that about
Augusta before.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe Woods' runaway victory in '97 _ and the fact that
he was hitting short irons into par-5s _ led to the changes. Others
blame golf's new technology, which continues to allow pro golfers
to get greater distance, thus threatening to make older and shorter
courses obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new equipment has something to do with them changing the
course,'' John Huston said. ``There are all kinds of clubs that add
length off the tee and clubs that get greater flight and all kinds
of stuff. They're changing with the equipment, so you don't know
when it might stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III understands the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Augusta ... they have maximized their length almost as much
as they can,'' he said. ``If the greens are fairly soft, if they
get a little bit of rain, guys are going to shoot it up, and they
have to do everything they can to keep that from happening. The
15th green gets higher every year and and 13 gets longer. They do
whatever they can to keep scores low.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nos. 10 and 16 greens have been rebuilt for agronomic reasons
and to reduce the encroachment of Bermuda grass. At the 10th green,
new pin positions were established by expanding the green left
front and right rear.
</P>
<P>
   _ On No. 16, the right front and right rear of the green has
been softened and the left front has been expanded. The changes
open the way for possible new pin positions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nos. 12 and 13 greens have been re-grassed, and the lost edges
were recovered by encroachment, making new pin placements.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the right side of the 14th fairway, as part of a
reforestation program, four trees have been planted. The addition
puts a premium on accuracy off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   _ On No. 17, two trees were removed on the right fairway, at
approximately 175 and 255 yards. Three trees were added between
Nos. 15 and 17 on the fairway beyond the Eisenhower Tree. The tee
has been moved up 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``After careful consideration and after consulting several
players and our golf course architect, we made additional
modifications to No. 17,'' Johnson said. ``The changes at No. 17
will continue to place a premium on accuracy off the tee. Overall,
we were satisfied with the hole last year, but we think this will
be a further improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jury is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised at all the changes, just because of the history
there,'' David Toms said. ``All the people who have gone around
that golf course ... being able to compare them to what's going on
now with the current players can't really be done. So, it's
unfortunate. The rough they've added makes a difference. They're
trying to make it harder to play. But it's still a great
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price has no problem with the changes. He thinks Augusta
National needs to keep pace with enhanced technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy they are doing that,'' Price said. ``There are
changes that needed to be done there over the years. It's nice to
see them do that, to make the course play longer and harder. The
players today, with the way equipment has advanced, can hit the
ball a long way. In the end, as talented as the players are, it
sounds as if they prefer more of a challenge than not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the course) needed some sort of defense as the game
has progressed, but I think they have gone about it the right
way,'' Lee Westwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Palmer joked that the continued growth of the course
prompted him to reach out to Augusta officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have written a note to the powers at Augusta and said that
since I am now a member, I'd like to play the members tees,''
Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed, but his point was well-taken.

POSSIBILITY OF DISRUPTION BY SMALL GROUP OF CUBAN EXILES GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Cuban-Boy-Opposition; a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Elian Gonzalez's father, kept from his young son for
more than four months, received approval from the US government
Monday to come to the United States and take at least temporary
custody of the boy, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But details over when and where relatives who have been caring
for the boy will hand him over must still be worked out. The issue
is an incendiary one. With hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Cuban
exiles vowing to stop the child from being returned to his
homeland, federal authorities want to avoid a confrontation at the
home of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, in Miami's Little
Havan, where Elian has been staying.
</P>
<P>
   Miami residents from all walks of life worry that might be
impossible, regardless of where the exchange takes place. As word
filtered back that visas had been granted to a delegation from Cuba
and arrangements for Elian's care had been made, the crowd of
ardent anti-Castro exiles who gather daily outside the modest gray
house promptly linked arms and began practicing civil disobedience
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get what we want accomplished; we have to,' said Marta
Valdez, a retiree who emigrated from Cuba 30 years ago and was at
the house of Elian's great uncle for the first time Monday. ``We
have to help this boy. We'll figure out some way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, many of the demonstrators have vowed to avoid
violence and, instead, disrupt the city with sit-ins and marches.
Their numbers, in fact, are relatively small _ 5,000 or so hardcore
exiles who can be counted on to demonstrate whenever a Cuban band
performs in Miami or confront politicians who do not speak to their
liking, according to local observers.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pittance a city with some 800,000 Cuban or
Cuban-American residents. But it's a loud constituency that is
unaccustomed to losing, and some Miamians, Cubans among them, fear
that ugliness is inevitable if federal officials try to return
Elian to his father in Cuba, as the US Immigration and
Naturalization Service has ordered. A federal judge upheld that
order, a ruling that Elian's Miami relatives are now appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a situation that's going to be resolved easily or
maybe even peacefully,'' said James Kane, chief pollster for the
Florida Voter Poll, which has found that most people in the state
support the government's position. ``All of us are saying, 'What if
federal marshals have to go in and take the boy?' The Cuban
community is going to lose whatever composure it has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about a little boy,'' he added. ``This is about a
man, (Cuban leader Fidel) Castro, and our relationship with Cuba.
Elian is just a symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   As a symbol or as a sad little boy who was found alone clinging
to an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day after his mother drowned with
others en route to Florida and freedom, Elian has won the hearts of
almost everyone here.
</P>
<P>
   But while a Miami Herald poll showed that only 5 percent of
Cubans say Elian should be sent home, questions concerning his
future have gripped only a tiny segment of the Cuban exile
population, with many, expecially younger Cubans or Cuban-Americans
born in the United States, more concerned with their careers or
mortgage payments than protesting his plight. Immigrants from other
Caribbean countries sound almost fed up with the attention being
paid the boy and the possibility of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because they're not getting their way doesn't mean they
can break the law or stop traffic or other stuff,'' said Edgar
Perdomo, a half-Puerto Rican, half-Dominican hotel maintenance
worker. ``It's not right. It's unfair, really unfair, that no other
group gets the same breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Martha Compos, a Nicaraguan restaurant hostess who has
been waiting 13 years for permanent residency, ``Oh yeah, big time
they're used to getting what they want. It should be the same for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubans get what they want like that,'' she added, snapping her
fingers and noting that she does not know why her paperwork has yet
to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
apparently imminent, negotiations between lawyers for the relatives
and the federal government are scheduled to resume Tuesday. The
marathon session Monday resulted in several developments, among
them the ``temporary care'' arrangement placing Elian with his
father in exchange for a promise by Gonzalez to remain in Miami
during the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Six visas were granted, to Gonzalez, his second wife, their baby
son, a young cousin of Elian's, one of his kindergarten teachers
and a pediatrician -- just six of the more than 28 visas sought by
Cubans in Havana. Elian's father and his family would stay at the
home of Cuba's chief diplomat in Washington, Fernando Remirez, who
lives in an upscale suburban Maryland neighborhood. Remirez, his
wife and two children will vacate the house to make room for the
visitors from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The other visas are for Elian's classmates and for National
Assembly President Rafael Alarcon, a top aide to Cuban President
Fidel Castro; those applications are still being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the number of visas granted could help soothe tempers
in the middle-class neighborhood where Elian has been living with
his relatives, specialists in Cuban-American politics said,
particularly if his father is the one to take Elian from the house.
Still, the scenario that everyone agrees would be easiest and
safest would be a transfer at a neutral location, one away from the
knots of people now stationed outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is not going to burn down,'' said Max Castro, a
political science professor at the University of Miami. ``There
aren't going to be more than a few dozen arrests at most. Maybe the
port or airport will be closed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the strategy of the family has been very disturbing,'' he
added. ``They've been saying they won't do anything to facilitate
the transfer but you're going to have to come through this crowd.
It's a very cynical position.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the great uncle's house, where a woman handed out
turquoise-blue plastic rosaries and an early afternoon crowd of
perhaps 50 people prayed for the boy whose arrival some have
compared to the birth of the baby Jesus, mortgage banker Henry
Someillan insisted Elian should stay in the United States and that
his father should instead move to Miami. His own father, he said,
went to prison fighting for a democratic future for Cuba. A lot of
fathers did. And their sons, raised without them, turned into fine
men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Someillan said he was willing to go only so far to fight
for his own beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuban society has never demonstrated violence in this
country,'' he said. ``We'll form human chains. We'll make things
difficult. I'll go as far as I'm allowed to go so that I don't get
hurt and no one else gets hurt. ``

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR CASE ON RESTRICTIONS ON LEGAL AID TO POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb.)  (EDS: Subs 5th graf, `The welfare restriction ...,' to end to add
background; no pickup.) 
(js) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The highly charged question of what strings the
government can attach to the use of federal money reached the
Supreme Court again Monday, this time in the context of legal
services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to decide whether Congress had violated the
First Amendment when it restricted the type of arguments that
lawyers supported by the federal Legal Services Corp. can make on
behalf of clients seeking welfare benefits. Under the restriction,
the lawyers can help clients who are seeking to receive or restore
specific welfare benefits, but may not become involved in ``an
effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in New York ruled last year that
because the provision, first imposed on the agency in 1996,
``clearly seeks to discourage challenges to the status quo,'' it
amounted to ``viewpoint discrimination'' that the First Amendment
made impermissible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest protection of the First Amendment's free speech
guarantee goes to the right to criticize government or advocate
change in government policy,'' Judge Pierre N. Leval said in his
majority opinion for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, adding
that criticism of the government ``is also speech for which liberty
must be preserved to guarantee freedom of political choice to the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The welfare restriction that the court will review was adopted
as part of an appropriations bill during a contentious
election-year congressional session in which opponents of the Legal
Services Corp. came close to eliminating financing for the program
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise, the corporation accepted a long list of
restrictions on lawyers who work in programs that receive its
money, including bans on class actions, on most representation of
undocumented aliens, on actions to recover lawyers' fees, on
participating in cases on behalf of a prisoner and on representing
tenants evicted for drug use from public housing. The restrictions
have been carried over in subsequent fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration appealed to the Supreme Court,
arguing that the restriction posed no constitutional problem
because Congress ``has simply chosen to pay for certain services
but not others.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's brief said what was barred was not a
viewpoint but rather ``a certain class of case,'' explaining that
Congress limited the program ``to ensure that the program focuses
on the day-to-day legal problems of the poor people who are
attempting to obtain benefits to which they may be entitled under
the current program'' rather than on trying to change the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School
challenged the restrictions, as well as separate limitations on the
use of private money by legal services lawyers, on behalf of groups
of legal services lawyers and clients. While the Legal Services
Corp. itself was the defendant in the lawsuit, filed in 1997 in
federal District Court in Brooklyn, the federal government
intervened to defend the constitutionality of the restrictions.
Legal Services of New York, a recipient of Legal Services Corp.
money, was also a defendant in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs lost in district court and, for the most part, in
the 2nd Circuit as well. The appeals court upheld most of the
restrictions, with the exception of the welfare restriction. Under
the analysis of the appellate panel's 2-1 decision, it might well
have been acceptable for Congress to place welfare cases of all
kinds out of bounds for legal services lawyers; what offended the
majority was the limitation on the legal tools that lawyers could
use once they were in the midst of representing clients seeking
welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday granted appeals from both the Legal
Services Corp. (Legal Services Corp. vs. Velazquez, No. 99-603) and
the government (U.S. vs. Velazquez, No. 99-960). The two appeals
will be consolidated for argument, which will be held in October.
The justices took no action on the plaintiffs' separate appeal from
the portions of their suit that they lost in the 2nd Circuit
(Velazquez vs. Legal Services Corp., No. 99-604).
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, the administration said it was clear from Supreme
Court precedents that the government could incorporate its
preference for the use of its money into federal law or
regulations. The case the administration cited was a 1991 decision,
Rust vs. Sullivan, which upheld a prohibition on counseling about
abortion in family planning clinics that received federal money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the administration said, the legal services
restrictions were less stringent than those the Supreme Court
upheld in the 1991 case, because employees of clinics that received
federal money were prohibited from mentioning abortion at all, and
could not refer women to private clinics or doctors even if the
patient made a direct request. President Clinton repealed those
regulations early in his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legal services restrictions, lawyers can still refer
potential clients to outside lawyers, including to affiliated
poverty law programs that are not financed with federal money.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Rust vs. Sullivan, the precedent on which the
administration is relying, ultimately proves reliable depends in
part on Justice David H. Souter's current view of that case. It was
a 5-4 decision in which Souter, then just completing his first term
on the court, joined Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But as Souter indicated last week, when he repudiated an
approach he took to a state ban on nude dancing, in another 1991
case, his view of the First Amendment has changed over the years.
Two years ago, in fact, Souter was the lone dissenter from a
decision that rejected a challenge to the decency standards that
Congress imposed on the grant-making procedures of the National
Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These were among the other developments at the court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the justices turned down the Clinton
administration's request for time to argue later this month against
the constitutionality of Nebraska's so-called partial-birth
abortion law. The lawyers challenging the state law on behalf of a
Bellevue, Neb., doctor, Dr. LeRoy Carhart, had agreed to give the
administration 10 minutes of their half-hour argument.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers speculated Monday that the court might have turned down
the request because there was no equivalent federal law on the
books, making the government's interest somewhat more remote than
usual when it seeks to participate in a state case. President
Clinton has twice vetoed a proposed federal law. The administration
has filed a brief in this case, Stenberg vs. Carhart, No. 99-830.
</P>
<P>
   Deadlocked in a 4-4 vote, the court dismissed a case argued last
week that had been expected to produce a ruling on federal court
jurisdiction over certain kinds of plaintiffs in class-action
lawsuits. The case was Free vs. Abbott Laboratories, No. 99-391, a
price-fixing case against manufacturers of baby formula. Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, who owns a modest amount of stock in one of
the defendant companies, did not participate.

SPORTS COLUMN: A LEFT-HANDED COMPLEMENT AT DH 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Who said the Yankees didn't have a left-handed
designated hitter? As long as Bernie Williams' throwing shoulder
hurts, they've got the best one they've ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dull ache, but it doesn't hurt when I swing,'' Williams said
in a clubhouse charged with the anticipation of a new season,
another one promising to last well into October, no matter what
those Grapefruit League standings said.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Yankees survived another Darryl Strawberry walk on
the wild side, and Ed Yarnall's lack of control and a few Florida
afternoons when George Steinbrenner was about to burst. That's what
spring training is for, working out the kinks, weeding out the
kooks and getting your serious lineup together and intentions in
order just in time for opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of serious and well-intentioned, here's Williams on the
eve of the Yankees' 2000 debut Monday night _ on American soil but
past everyone's bedtime back East, and how come Mark McGwire
doesn't sound off about that?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we want to win more than anybody else,'' said
Williams, before Orlando Hernandez, who starts everything now for
the Yankees, took the ball against the Angels at Edison Field.
``It's what we're playing for, the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds hokey in the context of the standard sports
cynicism, then go explain the amazing century not long ago
concluded with the Yankees' third World Series title in four years,
the last two in four-game sweeps, for a 20th- century grand total
of 25, or the most glorious .250 batting average there will ever
be.
</P>
<P>
   Explain Bernie Williams entering a 10th season in a Yankee
uniform and a 15th year at work for one organization, which is so
much against the odds of modern sports economics that Williams'
face must be on a dartboard somewhere in Marvin Miller's basement.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's an old story how Williams was so close to signing with
the Red Sox in November 1999 that he could smell the Fenway Park
sausage. The point is, he didn't, because Steinbrenner coughed up
$87.5 million (over seven years), and Williams weighed a few extra
Boston millions against center field in Yankee Stadium and all that
interlocking history stitched into his cap and shirt.
</P>
<P>
   New York being New York, Williams heard that although he was a
wonderful guy and that old softie Steinbrenner had made the
sentimental decision, maybe Albert Belle would have been a better
idea, given Williams' annual visits to the disabled list and his
tendencies to drift in and out of a leading role.
</P>
<P>
   Then the verdict came in, and the contemporary notion that
long-term security is the death of motivation, especially for a
player like laid-back Bernie, had been debunked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the fact that I played 158 games, despite the
fact that my left shoulder was killing me in the second half of the
season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He more than played; he produced. Career highs in hits (202) and
runs batted in (115) and runs scored (116). Yes, there were times
in the early months last season when Williams seemed to be on
cruise control, but, as Manager Joe Torre said, ``He's one of those
guys who's struggling, and you look up and he's hitting .330.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Williams hit .342, another career-best. And if
there was one moment last season when the Yankees were getting the
look of just another common contender, it was in September, in
Toronto, until Williams' grand slam snapped them from a state of
hypnosis, with orders to finish the century the way champion
Yankees should.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our superstar on a team that supposedly doesn't have
superstars,'' David Cone said. ``Derek Jeter is the de facto
captain, the guy we look to as a leader. But Bernie is the guy who
can really carry us, with those power numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Williams not only played down Cone's assertion that
he is the difference between very good and great, but almost looked
baffled by it, before deferring to his elders, like Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 37 and he's got 6 percent body fat,'' Williams said.
``Being around guys like Paul motivates me.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, it was easy for people to take their cue from
Williams and dwell on other vital issues in Florida. The DH. The
fifth starter. The backup infielder. But spring training ended,
mercifully, and the Yankees did have a better record than the Red
Sox, so how bad was it?
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza will cover the No. 5 spot until Steinbrenner's
baseball people figure out a permanent solution. And as for the DH,
that's where Williams started Sunday night _ with Ricky Ledee
starting in center field _ and is likely to remain for a while.
</P>
<P>
   What would he do with the extra time between at-bats? Hit off
the tee, he said. Watch video. Soft toss. Cheerlead. All those
exciting pastimes that come so naturally for a star who hides in
the clubhouse, strumming his guitar. And then you look up, and he's
hitting .342. &QL;

DESPITE A STRICKEN LEADER, JAPAN MAINTAINS ITS COOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The reaction to news that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
was in the hospital was testament to the Japanese determination to
maintain the ``wa,'' the social harmony that this country so
greatly prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Obuchi lay in the hospital in serious condition,
various economic developments caused the stock market to roar ahead
to its highest level in three years. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock
index rose 1.9 percent to close on Monday at 20,726.99, and
companies continued to churn out news releases outlining their
plans for alliances, investments and new products.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was no panic when the market opened Tuesday, as
investors seemed ready to continue their recent strategy of
shifting money out of stocks tied to the ``new economy'' and into
some of the lumbering giants that, by some measures, are
undervalued. At midmorning, the Nikkei had given up almost half of
Monday's gains, but that was attributed to the fall in the Nasdaq
market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That was in stark contrast to the gyrations that roiled the
stock market in America when there was even a remote possibility
that President Clinton might be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general view of the business world is that if the
political vacuum is short, the influence on the economy will be
limited,'' said Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Fuji Xerox Corp.
and leader of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, one of
the four large business lobbies here.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the government was careful to keep news that Obuchi
was hooked up to a respirator to itself until well after trading
stopped on Monday, making sure that investors focused on the good
news emanating from the currency market and from a survey of
business confidence released on Monday rather than on the prime
minister's illness.
</P>
<P>
   He had not designated a successor before his stroke, which
occurred in the wee hours of Sunday morning, and that lapse also
contributed to the delay in announcing the severity of his medical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a very cautious calculation made by the
party bosses in the Liberal Democratic Party not to disclose
everything at once,'' said Shigenori Okazaki, an analyst at Warburg
Dillon Read in Tokyo, referring to the governing party. ``Instead,
they released the news gradually, and the shock was mitigated.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign of panic in the markets Tuesday morning,
either. The party already seems to be lining up Yoshiro Mori as
Obuchi's successor. A colorless party loyalist, Mori is unlikely to
change the policies Obuchi pursued. Japan changes its prime
ministers almost as often as Italy does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common wisdom among Japanese and foreign investors I
talked to yesterday was that his replacement is unlikely to hammer
out a different policy course,'' said Kathy Matsui, chief
strategist at Goldman, Sachs (Japan) Ltd. ``The post tends to
change hands rather often here without any serious consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The normal ebb and flow of funds has also helped to cushion the
market. Many companies and banks, which typically have an
investment portfolio, tend to have hoarded cash prior to the close
of the fiscal year on March 31, in an effort to improve the look of
their balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   They traditionally open the fiscal year by redeploying that cash
in the stock and bond markets. The quarterly survey of business
confidence, or Tankan, which was released Monday, showed business
confidence rising for the fifth consecutive quarter, another sign
that corporate investment is picking up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope both the ruling party and the opposition parties will
work to make the political situation stable so we can quickly take
measures to compile a domestic and foreign agenda for the country
as quickly as possible,'' said Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of the
Toyota Motor Corp. &QL;

POSSIBILITY OF DISRUPTION BY SMALL GROUP OF CUBAN EXILES GROWS

<P>
   MIAMI _ Elian Gonzalez's father, kept from his young son for
more than four months, received approval from the US government
Monday to come to the United States and take at least temporary
custody of the boy, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But details over when and where relatives who have been caring
for the boy will hand him over must still be worked out. The issue
is an incendiary one. With hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Cuban
exiles vowing to stop the child from being returned to his
homeland, federal authorities want to avoid a confrontation at the
home of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, in Miami's Little
Havan, where Elian has been staying.
</P>
<P>
   Miami residents from all walks of life worry that might be
impossible, regardless of where the exchange takes place. As word
filtered back that visas had been granted to a delegation from Cuba
and arrangements for Elian's care had been made, the crowd of
ardent anti-Castro exiles who gather daily outside the modest gray
house promptly linked arms and began practicing civil disobedience
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get what we want accomplished; we have to,' said Marta
Valdez, a retiree who emigrated from Cuba 30 years ago and was at
the house of Elian's great uncle for the first time Monday. ``We
have to help this boy. We'll figure out some way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly, many of the demonstrators have vowed to avoid
violence and, instead, disrupt the city with sit-ins and marches.
Their numbers, in fact, are relatively small _ 5,000 or so hardcore
exiles who can be counted on to demonstrate whenever a Cuban band
performs in Miami or confront politicians who do not speak to their
liking, according to local observers.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pittance a city with some 800,000 Cuban or
Cuban-American residents. But it's a loud constituency that is
unaccustomed to losing, and some Miamians, Cubans among them, fear
that ugliness is inevitable if federal officials try to return
Elian to his father in Cuba, as the US Immigration and
Naturalization Service has ordered. A federal judge upheld that
order, a ruling that Elian's Miami relatives are now appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a situation that's going to be resolved easily or
maybe even peacefully,'' said James Kane, chief pollster for the
Florida Voter Poll, which has found that most people in the state
support the government's position. ``All of us are saying, 'What if
federal marshals have to go in and take the boy?' The Cuban
community is going to lose whatever composure it has.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about a little boy,'' he added. ``This is about a
man, (Cuban leader Fidel) Castro, and our relationship with Cuba.
Elian is just a symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   As a symbol or as a sad little boy who was found alone clinging
to an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day after his mother drowned with
others en route to Florida and freedom, Elian has won the hearts of
almost everyone here.
</P>
<P>
   But while a Miami Herald poll showed that only 5 percent of
Cubans say Elian should be sent home, questions concerning his
future have gripped only a tiny segment of the Cuban exile
population, with many, expecially younger Cubans or Cuban-Americans
born in the United States, more concerned with their careers or
mortgage payments than protesting his plight. Immigrants from other
Caribbean countries sound almost fed up with the attention being
paid the boy and the possibility of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because they're not getting their way doesn't mean they
can break the law or stop traffic or other stuff,'' said Edgar
Perdomo, a half-Puerto Rican, half-Dominican hotel maintenance
worker. ``It's not right. It's unfair, really unfair, that no other
group gets the same breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Martha Compos, a Nicaraguan restaurant hostess who has
been waiting 13 years for permanent residency, ``Oh yeah, big time
they're used to getting what they want. It should be the same for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubans get what they want like that,'' she added, snapping her
fingers and noting that she does not know why her paperwork has yet
to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
apparently imminent, negotiations between lawyers for the relatives
and the federal government are scheduled to resume Tuesday. The
marathon session Monday resulted in several developments, among
them the ``temporary care'' arrangement placing Elian with his
father in exchange for a promise by Gonzalez to remain in Miami
during the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Six visas were granted, to Gonzalez, his second wife, their baby
son, a young cousin of Elian's, one of his kindergarten teachers
and a pediatrician -- just six of the more than 28 visas sought by
Cubans in Havana. Elian's father and his family would stay at the
home of Cuba's chief diplomat in Washington, Fernando Remirez, who
lives in an upscale suburban Maryland neighborhood. Remirez, his
wife and two children will vacate the house to make room for the
visitors from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The other visas are for Elian's classmates and for National
Assembly President Rafael Alarcon, a top aide to Cuban President
Fidel Castro; those applications are still being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the number of visas granted could help soothe tempers
in the middle-class neighborhood where Elian has been living with
his relatives, specialists in Cuban-American politics said,
particularly if his father is the one to take Elian from the house.
Still, the scenario that everyone agrees would be easiest and
safest would be a transfer at a neutral location, one away from the
knots of people now stationed outside the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is not going to burn down,'' said Max Castro, a
political science professor at the University of Miami. ``There
aren't going to be more than a few dozen arrests at most. Maybe the
port or airport will be closed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the strategy of the family has been very disturbing,'' he
added. ``They've been saying they won't do anything to facilitate
the transfer but you're going to have to come through this crowd.
It's a very cynical position.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the great uncle's house, where a woman handed out
turquoise-blue plastic rosaries and an early afternoon crowd of
perhaps 50 people prayed for the boy whose arrival some have
compared to the birth of the baby Jesus, mortgage banker Henry
Someillan insisted Elian should stay in the United States and that
his father should instead move to Miami. His own father, he said,
went to prison fighting for a democratic future for Cuba. A lot of
fathers did. And their sons, raised without them, turned into fine
men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Someillan said he was willing to go only so far to fight
for his own beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuban society has never demonstrated violence in this
country,'' he said. ``We'll form human chains. We'll make things
difficult. I'll go as far as I'm allowed to go so that I don't get
hurt and no one else gets hurt. ``

UNHAPPY WAKEFIELD MAY SEEK TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Red Sox pitcher Tim Wakefield, angered at being sent
to the bullpen, plans to meet Friday in Anaheim, Calif., with his
agents, Bill Moore and Dick Moss, and is expected to ask the Sox to
be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Sox signed lefthander Pete Schourek over the weekend,
Wakefield was scheduled to pitch Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't told me this yet, but at some point, if this doesn't
change, he'll probably ask to be traded,'' Moore said from his
office in Arizona Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While Nomar Garciaparra was standing on one side of the Red Sox
clubhouse Monday, commenting on the absence of a spring controversy
for the first time since he joined the club, Wakefield was seething
on the other side, furious at being told he was going back to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing personal against Pete,'' Wakefield said, ``but why is
it always me that's the sacrificial lamb?''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield emerged from a meeting with manager Jimy Williams and
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, walked to his locker and immediately
turned to face reporters, anxious to say his piece publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of last season I wasn't on the playoff roster,''
said Wakefield, alluding to being dropped before the ALCS. ``I came
to spring training, and I was slated to be the No. 4 starter. I
felt I was needed and wanted, and now this happens. They're hot and
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, who said he volunteered to pitch in relief last June
when Tom Gordon went on the disabled list for the second time, has
more reason than usual to be anxious about how he is used. The
33-year-old knuckleballer is in the last year of a three-year
contract paying him $4.5 million this season, and after approaching
him last summer about picking up the $5 million option they hold on
him for next season, the Sox broke off talks.
</P>
<P>
   The sides met again in spring training about three weeks ago,
but talks broke off again last week, just a few days before
Wakefield was informed he was going back to the bullpen. General
manager Dan Duquette told Wakefield's representatives that they
would talk again after the season, when Wakefield is eligible to be
a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield hesitated when asked if he would request a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, as he did Sunday, insisted Wakefield was needed in the
bullpen because of injuries to Juan Pena (out for the year after
tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow) and Rod Beck
(on the DL with an irritated nerve root in his neck).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my versatility is being abused but that's my
opinion,'' Wakefield said. ``I've had teammates come to me and say
they feel like I'm being screwed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we're better with me as a starter. I'm averaging 13
wins as a starter, and I eat up a lot of innings. It's hard to
swallow right now, but I won't disrespect any of my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield's bargaining position for a new contract next season
is greatly weakened, of course, if he's not in the rotation. He was
not effective in spring training, going 1-1 with a 10.80 ERA, but
he claimed that he had better command of his knuckler than he did
last season, and publicly, both Williams and Kerrigan pronounced
themselves satisfied with his effort.
</P>
<P>
   It's still quite conceivable that when Beck returns, Wakefield
will be restored to the rotation and Schourek will displace
Fassero. Fassero, scheduled to pitch the third game of the series
against the Mariners here, was 0-1 with a 7.48 ERA in six
appearances this spring. In light of his 5-14 record and 7.20 ERA
last season, his spring numbers don't allay concerns that he is a
weak link in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect him to be (upset),'' Williams said of
Wakefield. ``That's good from my standpoint. It's good that he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make the decision. This is the best decision for our
team to start the season. We haven't played a game yet. We have to
start somewhere. Maybe there's a reason the decision had to be
made. We don't have a lot of options in Triple A.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams hinted that, given time, Wakefield may feel differently
about the decision. Williams brought up 1997 and his first
controversy as Sox manager, when he moved incumbent shortstop John
Valentin to make room for a rookie named Garciaparra. Valentin
walked out of a camp for a couple of days, but ultimately went
along with the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a cooling-off period then,'' Williams said. ``Here,
two days before the season, I have to tell a starter he's not going
to start. We don't have a lot of time. I understand that. If it
were me, I'd probably feel the same way.''

 &HT;    Galarraga hasn't lost a step
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter your vantage point Monday at the Turner
Field of Dreams, Andres Galarraga was the man in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   If Hollywood wasn't watching, it should get the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Cat returned to baseball with a bang _ or a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Just check the seventh-inning tears of wife, Eneyda, and
daughters, Andria, Katherine and Andrianna, for proof.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma _
cancer _ in his back, and wondering if he'd ever play again,
Galarraga didn't just put on a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   How about two fine defensive plays in the top of the inning,
including a diving stop to end a bases-loaded threat, and the
game-winning home run in the bottom half?
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is something special,'' Galarraga said. ``It's like a
movie. Believe me, I don't have the words to say how happy I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Braves and Rockies took the field, Eneyda closed her
eyes. She crossed herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed a lot for this moment,'' she said. ``I prayed before
for me, but after Andres' problems, I pray for everybody, the
children, my family, friends. We're very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Galarraga's homer, John Borum, 36, said, ``It's a
testament to the fact tough times don't last, but tough people
do.''
</P>
<P>
   TBS announcer Skip Caray said, ``It's amazing to think that a
year ago today, he wasn't sure he'd be alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga was deathly scared when diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   There was no fear Monday, just appreciation for a man who
averaged 41 homers and 129 RBIs from '95-'98, and enchanted people
with his smile.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder 9-year-old Bryan Johnson was dancing in the stands in
his Galarraga jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my favorite because he just seems like a nice person and
he's good,'' said Johnson's mother, Debbie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has moral ideas that are good for a 9-year-old,'' she said.
``If there's a player you want your child to emulate, it's him, not
just for his stance and style, but for his outlook on life.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Stan Belinda struck out Galarraga in the bottom of
the eighth. Afterward, he wasn't gloating. He was relating.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months ago, while with the Reds, Belinda was diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis. He knows of Galarraga's path.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go through something like that is a tremendous achievement,
not just in baseball, but in life,'' Belinda said. ``That's where
you separate hard-willed people from people who feel sorry for
themselves. It shows you what kind of heart he has.''

GATORS' MILLER MAY JOIN 3 SPARTANS IN GOING PRO  
 ANOTHER FLINT ATHLETE  
 MEET YOUR COUSIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson
and perhaps A.J. Granger should be off to professional training
camps next fall. But they may have company.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the season, Florida's sophomore forward Mike Miller
indicated that he was ready to enter the National Basketball
Association draft. As the Gators kept winning in the national
tournament, the native of South Dakota did his best to push those
thoughts away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is definitely on a roller-coaster ride right now,''
Miller said before Monday night's national championship game. ``If
I think about going to the NBA and leaving this team, I might fall
off. And if I fall off, I might pull the rest of the team with me.
When the season's over, of course, I will think about it. But to
think about it right now would be hurtful to myself and my team.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Final Four began, Miller admitted he had at least 45
contacts with the New York-based agent Andy Miller, who was not
registered as an agent in Florida and did not follow the state's
guidelines, which are the strictest in the country. Andy Miller is
under investigation in Florida for violating the law, which is a
felony. Mike Miller has said only that he did not violate NCAA
regulations. But he conceded that his plans and the flap over his
status, have been a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER FLINT ATHLETE
</P>
<P>
   The Florida media guide lists Teddy Dupay's hometown as Fort
Myers, Fla. But the sophomore guard was born in Kansas City, Mo.,
and has lived in other places. Dupay seems amused that the news
media is intrigued by Michigan State's ``Flintstones'' _ Mateen
Cleaves, Charlie Bell and Morris Peterson _ who are all from Flint,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make a big deal out of those guys from Flint,'' Dupay
said. ``I lived in Flint for six years, up until the third grade.
Welch Boulevard. Ask them. They'll know where that is. My point is:
It doesn't matter where you come from or how old you are. The game
is played between the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Flint Police Department confirmed that there is,
indeed, a street by that name. ``Go Spartans!'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The hometowns of the players do provide an interesting contrast
between the two teams. Eight of the 15 players on Michigan State's
roster are from the state of Michigan. Six others are from states
or a Canadian province that shares a border with Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   On the 13-man Florida roster, eight come from the Sunshine State
and three are from nearby states like Georgia, West Virginia and
North Carolina. But Mike Miller is from South Dakota and Matt
Bonner from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   MEET YOUR COUSIN
</P>
<P>
   Florida Coach Billy Donovan planned to rotate as many as four
players at center against Michigan State and that two of them
happened to be cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The starter Udonis Haslem and his first backup, Donnell Harvey,
are cousins, and Haslem found that out during the season. Haslem's
mother told him, and Harvey said he already knew but kept it a
secret because, ``I didn't know if I should say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Haslem is a 6-foot-7-inch sophomore and Harvey is a 6-8 freshman
who was the national high school player of the year from Shellman,
Ga. Haslem weighs 260 pounds and is the more physical player, and
Harvey weighs 216 pounds and is quicker and more athletic. The pair
give Donovan a special blend of muscle and quickness at center.
``They battle each other in practice and make each other better
players,'' Donovan said. ``People think we're a team that just
comes down and jacks up 3-pointers, but I feel very comfortable
with us feeding the ball into the post.''

 &HT;    Champion UConn appears blessed for future
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma's mother
sprinkled some holy water on the players Sunday in the moments
before their NCAA title game with Tennessee. But the Huskies
already were in a state of grace.
</P>
<P>
   Their 71-52 demolition of the Lady Volunteers had been billed as
a heavyweight battle between the sport's biggest rivals. Instead,
it was a crowning moment for a 36-1 UConn team ranked No. 1 all
season.
</P>
<P>
   The frightening prospect for the rest of women's basketball is
that the Huskies, who return their top nine players, will be
complemented by the best recruiting class in the country. But
unlike the Lady Vols, who boasted after their 39-0 championship
season in 1998 that they would be ``better than ever'' _ then got
bounced out in the Elite Eight the next season _ UConn won't make
any bold declarations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early right now for us to be looking at next year,''
said UConn guard Shea Ralph, the Final Four MVP with 15 points,
seven assists and six steals. ``We're just going to enjoy
everything about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph personified the Huskies. Even though she has had to
overcome two knee injuries, Ralph thinks nothing of flinging
herself to the floor to dive for loose balls. Center Kelly
Schumacher, from the hockey hotbed of rural Quebec, blocked nine
shots. Point guard Sue Bird, bothered by a jammed finger most of
the game, adeptly led the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach said it ... `There were no MVPs,''' Ralph said. ``This
was a team effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, denied its seventh title, will have all of its
firepower coming back. But the Lady Vols, vulnerable in the
backcourt at times during the season, don't have any immediate
solutions for enhancing a guard contingent that is not quick or
particularly adept at perimeter shooting. Their top signee is a
post player.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game doesn't mean that your program's falling apart or
that you can't be competitive at this level,'' Tennessee coach Pat
Summitt said. ``We haven't won six titles thinking that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As in their 27-point loss to Georgia in January, however, the
Vols were susceptible to a team with depth, pressure defense and
prowess in transition.
</P>
<P>
   They never picked up UConn running countless back-door plays or
flashing cutters across the lane. ``They only ran two offenses the
whole night, but when they ran them, they scored,'' Tennessee
forward Tamika Catchings said. Catchings had 16 points but
struggled against double-team defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Tennessee reeled off three NCAA titles in a row after losing
to UConn in the 1995 championship game. For the moment, the only
other team with a reasonable chance to challenge UConn's supremacy
is Georgia, which has eight of its top nine players returning and
three high school All-Americans on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this 26 years, and I've never experienced
anything like this,'' Summitt said.

   &UR; STOCKGIFT _ &LR;  When business student Gino Heilizer and photo
editor Christina Shutes of Washington, D.C., became engaged a
couple of years ago, they followed the age-old custom of signing up
with the bridal registry at a local department store.
</P>
<P>
   But as they debated which items to request from their relatives
and friends, it dawned on them that they didn't really need any of
the traditional wedding gifts. Already in their late 20s, they had
long since stocked up on silverware, dishes, linens and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Heilizer and Shutes decided to break with tradition, so six
weeks ago, they launched Stockgift.com, an online registry where
engaged couples _ or anyone else, for that matter _ can discreetly
ask for money to buy stocks.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Analysts Approve of Move to Sell Money-Losing Learning Co.  &HT;     By Carrie Kirby

 &QL; 
Mattel, the world's largest toymaker, announced yesterday plans to
sell its money-losing software business.
<P>
   Analysts predict that the El Segundo (Los Angeles County)
company will recoup less than a third of what it paid last year for
the Learning Co., which makes most of Mattel's software.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Mattel's software titles, the most well known of
which are Myst, the Carmen Sandiego series, and Barbie titles such
as Barbie Fashion Designer, is unclear, although the company said
in a statement that it intends to retain control of all traditional
Mattel brands.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman declined to comment on who would produce
software based on popular Mattel brands such as Barbie, Hot Wheels
and Fisher-Price once the sale is complete.
</P>
<P>
   The software business will be treated as a discontinued
operation in Mattel's financial statements effective March 31,
according to the company's statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Mattel paid $3.6 billion in stock to acquire the
Learning Co., a Cambridge, Mass., educational softwaremaker with
offices in Novato and Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sale, the Learning Co. has weighed down Mattel's
profitability and stock performance. The Learning Co. lost $206
million in 1999 and has seen its stock lose two-thirds of its value
since the sale, falling from a high of $29 on April 16, 1999, to a
low of $9.50 on March 7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's chief executive Jill Barad resigned February 3 after
Mattel reported losing $18.4 million in its fourth quarter ending
December 31. Barad was widely criticized for paying too much for
the Learning Co., Company,  &LR; and the educational softwaremaker's
software maker's  &LR; continuous problems were a factor in her
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Also on February 3, Mattel announced a restructuring plan that
led to the layoff of about 500 workers at the Learning Co.,
including several hundred in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel has engaged Credit Suisse First Boston to sell the
software business. Analysts predicted the selling price will range
from $200 million to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The toy company may license to an outside softwaremaker the
rights to produce games based on its name brands, much like it has
licensed the Barbie and Hot Wheels names to Patriot Computers to
create children's personal computers based on those brands, said
Jim Silver, publisher of the Toy Book, a monthly trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Possible buyers for the Learning Co. include Havas Interactive,
a division of the French company Vivendi SA; Knowledge Universe;
Microsoft; and Infogrames Entertainment, analysts said. But Jill
Krutick, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, questioned whether the
money-losing Learning Co. would be much in demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that a sale of (the Learning Co.) could be
difficult for Mattel,'' Krutick wrote in a report released
yesterday. Krutick predicted that the Learning Co. would lose $150
million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's stock closed at $10.93 yesterday, up slightly from
$10.50 the day before. Analysts viewed the sale as a step that
might put Mattel on the path to recovery and almost inevitable in
the light of the Learning Co.'s dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were solid, competent management in place, I could
see them trying to turn (the software business) around,'' said Sean
McGowan, director of research for Gerard Klauer Mattison. But since
Barad's resignation, McGowan charged, Mattel's acting CEO Ronald M.
Loeband has only given Mattel part-time attention. ``You have a
rudderless, leaderless company now.''
</P>
<P>
   Krutick, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said the sale of
the Learning Co. may help Mattel attract a permanent CEO.
</P>
<P>
   While the entire CD-ROM industry has faced difficulties in
recent years, McGowan was critical of the Learning Co. acquisition
even though getting into the software industry was not an unwise
choice for Mattel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are spending less time and attention and money on
traditional toys. Software seemed to be a logical choice, and it
continues to be a logical choice, but educational software is less
interesting to kids than fun software,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   While Hasbro, Mattel's main rival, has been more successful with
its software division, it, too, has faced speed bumps on the road
to bringing its business into the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Hasbro closed Alameda's Microprose, a software
company it had purchased just 16 months earlier. But while Barbie
is Mattel's only truly high-selling software title, Hasbro has been
able to build success on a variety of successful games in its
stables, including classics such as Frogger, and Hasbro board games
such as Scrabble and Monopoly, Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View company Purple Moon, purchased by Mattellast
March, will also be included in the sale.

 _ SF CHRON   Market's Bulls Still Hot for Microsoft's Battered Stock 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft stock tumbled 14.5 percent yesterday, bringing it all the
way back to where it was a month ago.
<P>
   That's right. Despite the severe beating, which sparked a
bloodbath in tech stocks, Microsoft's stock closed a few cents
above its price on March 6, before it started running up on rumors
of an impending settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, who have been mostly bullish on the stock
since last fall, were slow to change their opinions yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Of 27 analysts tracked by First Call, nine reiterated a ``strong
buy'' rating, six reiterated a ``buy'' and only one downgraded the
stock. Of course, that could change today as analysts have more
time to digest the news, said Chuck Hill, director of research at
Boston's First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Lone bear Melissa Eisenstat of CIBC World Markets lowered her
recommendation on Microsoft yesterday from a buy to a hold.
</P>
<P>
   Her previous rating ``was based on a hope that the suit would be
settled, over, boom, finished, no more black cloud, and that even
if it hit the operating model, people would say, `We can move
on.'''
</P>
<P>
   With yesterday's decision, ``unfortunately the black cloud is
just bigger. If you take the long-term view, it's still a great
company. But there's enough uncertainty that I'm just unwilling to
say, `Back up the truck and start buying here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstat also believes that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's
issuing of the conclusion of law opens Microsoft to a flood of
civil lawsuits. ``Microsoft has roughly $18 billion in cash with
which to defend itself, yet we believe that there is significant
risk in moving from a technological innovator to a defendant on
many fronts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the close on Friday, Microsoft was trading at 55 times
expected earnings, more than twice its 25 percent earnings growth
rate. ``When a high-flier gets crushed, you sometimes see the
multiples contract to something like one times the growth rate,''
Eisenstat said. ``This suggests that a 50 percent correction in the
share price is possible, but not probable.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenstat believes the antitrust case will affect Microsoft's
operations over the longer term, but she didn't change her earnings
estimate because she doesn't have enough ``clarity on the relief
and its impact on Microsoft's future earnings power.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, First Call's Hill doesn't think any analysts will be
changing their estimates, because Jackson's ruling ``won't have any
impact for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the reason why so many brokerage houses upheld
their outlooks yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does (yesterday's decision) change the way Microsoft does
business? The answer is zero,'' said Brown Brothers Harriman
analyst Sanjiv Hingorani, who reiterated his buy recommendation.
``It's not going to be put into effect for a long time, if ever.
The business fundamentals of the company will take hold once
investors internalize the fact that there isn't going to be a quick
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He think's Microsoft's stock will perk up when the company
reports earnings on April 20. He expects they will be higher than
the current consensus estimate.
</P>
<P>
   George Godfrey of ING Barings reiterated his strong buy rating
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I liked it at 106 on Friday, I have to love it at 91,'' he
said. ``Even if the courts take the most aggressive approach, a
breakup, I actually think, from a pure investment perspective, that
shareholders will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanely Dean Witter , &LR; maintained
her ``outperform'' rating on Microsoft. ``We believe, on average
over the next few years, MSFT shares will outperform the S&AMP;P 500
owing to above average revenue and operating income growth,'' she
wrote in a report. ``That said, we think this DOJ investigation
continues to be a negative not only because it's a serious cloud
that creates uncertainty, but also because it is a serious morale
hitter for Microsoft employees.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. I called several analysts who were quoted here last week
saying Microsoft is a great buy. None returned my call.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
VANGUARD DROPS FEES &QL; 
Vanguard Group is removing those annoying transaction fees on five
of its index funds and lowering the fees on three others.
</P>
<P>
   The Small-Cap, European, Pacific and Total International index
funds are eliminating their 0.5 percent transaction fees, and the
Extended Market fund is killing its 0.25 percent fee.
</P>
<P>
   The Emerging Markets Fund is lowering its fee to 0.5 percent
from 1 percent. The Tax-Managed International Fund is reducing its
fee to 0.25 percent from 0.75 percent. And the Tax-Managed
Small-Cap Fund is cutting the fee to 0.5 percent from 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Transaction fees apply to all new purchases, but unlike loads
that are paid out to brokers, they go back into the fund to cover
the cost of buying stocks. Vanguard said it could cut the fees
because the cost of trading has declined.
</P>
<P>
   Although this is good news for most Vanguard customers, ``If if
 &LR; you're already in the fund and are not making new purchases, the
change is a slight negative,'' said Scott Cooley, a senior analyst
with fund-rater Morningstar. That's because investors who are
buying new shares will be paying less or nothing to subsidize the
cost of their purchases.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cooley said that drawback will be far outweighed by
eliminating the nuisance factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had all kinds of complaints from people about the
transaction fees. A lot of people see these are no-load funds and
don't realize the fees are there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It especially irritates smaller investors because on top of
the transaction fee, you get a $2.50 per quarter account
maintenance fee if you have less than $10,000 in a fund. Some
people feel like they're getting nickel-and-dimed.''
</P>
<P>
   The change does not affect the annual fees paid by all
shareholders to cover management and operating expenses.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Sega Site to Give Video Gamers World-Class Competition  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Video-game-consolemaker Sega will venture into uncharted territory
today with the launch of a company that for the first time will let
console users battle each other over the Internet.
<P>
   At its annual summit today in Las Vegas, San Francisco's Sega of
America will spin off Sega.com Inc., an independent firm that
includes a gaming portal and Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which will go live in May, will act as the gateway
to Sega games on the Web for users of its flagship Dreamcast
console. SegaNet, the ISP, will be operated by a yet-to-named
 &LR; yet-to-be-named company, and is scheduled to premiere debut  &LR; in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Sega.com, also to be based in San Francisco, has $100 million in
backing from Sega Enterprises Ltd, Sega of America's Japanese
parent, and about 150 employees, many of whom are from the
now-defunct SegaSoft division.
</P>
<P>
   For Sega, the venture represents a revamped Internet strategy
and an attempt to ride the momentum from having sold more than 2
million Dreamcast console units. Sega and its larger competitors
are rushing to go after the exploding online game market.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications, a New York research firm, expects the
number of gamers online to grow from about 38 million last year to
68 million by 2003. Revenues from advertising on gaming sites and
subscriptions for online games is expected to shoot from $106
million in 1999 to $769 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a unique position in that we're the only company that
owns the delivery system, the proprietary hardware and proprietary
software,'' said Greg Chiemingo, Sega.com's vice president of
marketing. ``That's something no other company can match.''
</P>
<P>
   Sega hopes its Internet online game strategy will lure game
enthusiasts, who want the network's tournaments, chat rooms,
rankings and cheat codes, and folks who don't have a computer but
want to be able to cruise the Internet, get e-mail and play games.
</P>
<P>
   But Schelley Olhava, analyst at research firm IDC, is skeptical
about Sega's latest venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting into the ISP business is really risky,'' she said.
``It's going to be an upward battle getting people to go SegaNet
because a lot of consumers already have established service with
AOL or EarthLink, and it's hard to get people to do things like
change their e-mail email  &LR; addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   To offset some of those concerns, Sega is offering a powerful
financial incentive.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who sign a two-year contract with SegaNet will get a
free keyboard and a check for $200, which covers the cost of the
$199 Dreamcast. Sega says it will make money through ISP
subscriptions _ $21.95 a month _ as well as advertising, fees from
e-commerce transactions and licensing.
</P>
<P>
   The Net venture will be unprecedented. While PC gamers have been
able to go head to head online for years with players of Quake, an
action title from Id Software, console owners of all types
including Dreamcast, PlayStation or Nintendo64 have been limited to
playing the person sitting beside them on the living room couch.
</P>
<P>
   Though there has been much hype to the contrary, no console
company has capitalized on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Sega unveiled its 56K modem-equipped Dreamcast in
September, there were almost no online titles for it, though users
could send e-mail and surf the Web on the minimal Dreamcast
Network.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it has remedied that by lining up more than a
dozen online games, including Quake 3 and NFL 2K1 for the SegaNet
and Sega.com launches this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, analysts say Sega's main advantage is a word
rarely hyped in today's lexicon: narrowband.
</P>
<P>
   The X-Box, Microsoft's first console, and Sony's pending
PlayStation 2 support only broadband such as DSL and other
high-speed connections. By contrast, narrowband refers to 56K or
slower Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sega will offer a broadband adapter later this year, it
will initially fashion its Sega.com games with the Dreamcast's 56K
modem in mind.
</P>
<P>
   By capitalizing on narrowband now rather than when broadband
reaches a critical mass, Sega gains a major foothold in the online
gaming industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sega is acknowledging that there are many paths to the
Internet, and that includes narrowband as well as broadband,'' said
Bruce Leichtman, analyst at the Yankee Group, a Boston research
firm. ``Broadband is emerging, but there are still many, many more
people with narrowband. If you're only focusing on broadband,
you're only going to get a very, very small piece of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2 million people have broadband connections now, versus
about 40 million with 56K or slower, Leichtman said. By 2004,
broadband users will swell to almost 17 million. But narrowband
will still remain dominant _ with about 50 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Narrowband may give Sega a lead _ but it will a finite one,
industry watchers predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to have games the competition won't have,
they're just going to have them first,'' said Joe Funk, editor of
Electronic Gaming Monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the X-Box isn't due out until 2001, as is Nintendo's
Dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's PlayStation 2 _ the industry's 800-pound gorilla _ is set
to hit U.S. stores this fall, but so far, the company hasn't
announced any online titles. Also, the company on Saturday began
recalling 1.6 million PlayStation 2 units because they played
unauthorized DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these missteps from its competitors, Sega's online
foray won't be a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   After the debacle surrounding its failed Genesis console in the
mid-1990s, the company slipped to a distant third in the gaming
hardware market (behind No. 1 Sony and then Nintendo) and was
written off by many in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamcast has helped the company regain a 15 percent slice of
the console market, up from 0.5 percent just before its launch. But
it's still far from the 50 percent Sega once commanded.
</P>
<P>
   And as more entertainment, Internet and software companies turn
an eye toward the lucrative and growing game industry, Sega will
continue to face stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
   The latest juggernaut on the horizon is a recent partnership
between American Online and Electronic Arts. The companies late
last year formed an alliance in which Redwood City's Electronic
Arts, the No. 1 video-game-maker in the United States, will create
games and other entertainment content for AOL, the world's No. 1
online services provider.
</P>
<P>
   Still, game insiders give the company kudos for being the first
console to truly support online games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a milestone in the game industry because
it's so different from playing online with a PC,'' said Crispin
Boyer, editor at Electronic Gaming Monthly. ``This is going to be
playing games on the Internet with people from around the world
with a console _ something that costs thousands less than a PC.''

 &HT;    Weight concerns dog Dayne
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne and Georgia Tech
quarterback Joe Hamilton were two of college football's best
players last year. They finished 1-2 in voting for the Heisman
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of many NFL scouts, Dayne is too large and
Hamilton too small.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the players in this year's draft, the pair might inspire
the least consensus. Because of his height, Hamilton probably won't
be chosen until the second day of the draft, possibly no earlier
than the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, the NCAA's career rushing leader with 6,397 yards, will
go in the first round. But concerns about his weight seem likely to
prevent him from being the first running back selected. At
February's draft combine, Dayne tipped the scales at 259 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, he's always going to have problems with his
weight,'' said Reed Johnson, the Falcons' director of college
scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams have Dayne rated the fourth-best running back, behind
Virginia's Thomas Jones, Alabama's Shaun Alexander and Tennessee's
Jamal Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, who has been compared with the Steelers' Jerome Bettis
and former Redskins star John Riggins, seemed to temper some
concerns about his waistline after a workout last month in Madison,
Wis. He ran the 40-yard dash under 4.6 seconds, much faster than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Ron Dayne,'' Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson said.
``He fits well into our offense. That's what we do. We run the
ball. We hammer you and hammer you and hammer you, and, hopefully,
in the fourth quarter you break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, who have the 21st pick of the draft, are one of
several teams expected to draft a running back in the first round.
The Ravens (fifth and 15th picks), Cardinals (seventh), Giants
(11th) and Seahawks (19th and 22nd) also need running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to me,'' Dayne said. ``I don't get caught up
into No. 1, No. 2, whatever. As long as I get picked and get to
play, I'll be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scouts also were concerned about Dayne's stamina, because
he didn't play in the fourth quarter of many games. But Dayne says
he wasn't in the game because the Badgers blew out most of their
opponents the past two seasons. Others say he carried the ball too
much in his four seasons at Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably one of the bigger concerns with him is, if you're of
the belief that a back has only so much mileage, he's carried the
ball an awful lot over four years,'' said Phil Savage, the Ravens'
director of college scouting.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks before the April 15-16 draft, the Great
Dayne continues to take everything in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got everything a smaller running back has, but better,''
he said. ``I don't seen any running backs like me. That's the
reason why people criticize me. They don't know where to put me.''

When business student Gino Heilizer and photo editor Christina
Shutes of Washington, D.C., became engaged a couple of years ago,
they followed the age-old custom of signing up with the bridal
registry at a local department store.
<P>
   But as they debated which items to request from their relatives
and friends, it dawned on them that they didn't really need any of
the traditional wedding gifts. Already in their late 20s, they had
long since stocked up on silverware, dishes, linens and the like.
</P>
<P>
   What they actually wanted, they agreed, was money to buy stock
so they could ride the powerful bull market to wedded prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to start saving for our financial welfare, for kids,
for their college,'' Heilizer says. ``We have the mundane stuff of
life, so we wanted to start building our portfolio. We have a lot
of friends in the same boat.''
</P>
<P>
   But tradition says that you aren't supposed to ask your wedding
guests for hard cash _ it's too tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   Heilizer and Shutes decided that it doesn't have to be, so six
weeks ago, they launched Stockgift.com, an online registry where
engaged couples _ or anyone else, for that matter _ can discreetly
ask for money to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Stockgift.com does the buying for them. It is licensed
as a securities broker, and it makes money off the venture by
charging $19.95 for each trade it transacts.
</P>
<P>
   Stockgift.com maintains a Web site at www.stockgift.com and
assigns the prospective gift recipients their own, separate Web
pages. To get installed on the site, they must fill out the forms
normally required to open a brokerage account.
</P>
<P>
   Stockgift.com recipients typically choose the stocks they would
like to own and include a little write-up explaining how they
decided on their choices.
</P>
<P>
   The gift givers can transfer actual shares of stock if they
happen to own stakes in companies the recipients like. But most
givers simply contribute cash, either by check or credit card. (If
they use a credit card, Stockgift.com charges them a 2.95 percent
processing fee.)
</P>
<P>
   As the money accumulates, Stockgift.com spreads it evenly among
the stocks the recipients requested.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it is up to the recipients to decide whether and
when they want to sell the stocks in their accounts. They can use
the account as they would any other brokerage account _ for
example, to buy more stocks with their own money.
</P>
<P>
   If they are audacious enough, the recipients might personally &LR; 
 &LR; buttonhole potential givers and tell them to check out the
Stockgift.com Web site. If they are too shy to make their own
pitch, Stockgift.com will do it for them by sending out e-mail
notices.
</P>
<P>
   Stockgift.com isn't only for weddings. The more than 100
registrations now currently  &LR; on the Web site also include births,
birthdays, confirmations, bar mitzvahs, graduations, college funds,
you name it.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where the recipient is a minor, an adult must set up
and administer the brokerage account as custodian.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web pages celebrate no occasion in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Jones, 31, chief technical officer of a Santa Clara firm
that helps other companies develop their Web sites, recently
registered his little goddaughter, Isabella Sells, with
Stockgift.com after hearing an announcement about the service on
the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't defined an event yet,'' he says. But he is asking
Isabella's family and family friends to take a look at her Web
page.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, considering his profession, Jones chose three
big, Internet-related stocks _ Cisco Systems, Microsoft and 3Com _
for Isabella's portfolio. But he also tossed in General Electric.
``Every portfolio should have a blue chip,'' he explains
apologetically.
</P>
<P>
   David Schiffman, 31, a salesman in Highland Park, Ill., set up a
page for his daughter, Alexis, on the Stockgift.com Web site. The
occasion is her first birthday, which won't arrive until October.
</P>
<P>
   Schiffman says he heard about Stockgift.com from a friend who
works for the company.
</P>
<P>
   He chose Microsoft and America Online for his daughter's
portfolio because, as he explains on the Web site, they promise
``solid growth and performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiffman confesses: ``I don't know if I have a really good
reason for picking those stocks. I play the market shorter term
myself, but I figure for her _ regardless of what Microsoft and AOL
might do in the short term _ they seem good for the longer term.''
</P>
<P>
   Heilizer says he can't estimate how many more people will sign
up with Stockgift.com, but he notes that his Web site is getting
1,000 hits per day. He is convinced that he is riding the wave of
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Meltzer, director of marketing for Los Angeles'
WeddingChannel.com, a leading online bridal registry that features
traditional gift giving, concedes that ``there is some validity''
to Heilizer's business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that it is important to accommodate a variety of
preferences, and we will look to expand our own registry offerings
down the road,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But she contends that traditional registries are ``here to
stay.'' WeddingChannel.com, she points out, is growing and
flourishing in its present form, with 350,000 listings from engaged
couples seeking gifts from such stores as Bloomingdale's, Macy's
and Burdine's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even couples who are marrying later and own some of the
household basics are viewing their wedding as an opportunity to
acquire higher-quality items,'' Meltzer explains.

CORZINE REPORTS A THREAT TO EXPOSE MORE ETHNIC SLURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Extending his stroll through the minefield of
ethnic politics just when the issue seemed behind him, Jon S.
Corzine Monday accused a spurned would-be campaign worker of trying
to blackmail him by threatening to go public with more ``dirt''
about supposed slurs against Italian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, who appeared alongside
Corzine, used the occasion to make it perfectly clear that he
supports Corzine over former Gov. Jim Florio in the Democratic
primary for the seat being vacated by Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who apologized repeatedly last week for making
offensive remarks _ most recently, for joking about cement shoes to
an Italian-American contractor _ said he had been threatened twice
on Friday, first in a telephone message left at the Corzine
campaign headquarters that morning and then in a late-night phone
call to Corzine's wife, Joanne, at their home in Summit.
</P>
<P>
   He identified the caller as Michael Cino, a co-chairman of an
Italian-American Democratic club called the Columbus Coalition, who
had sought a job with the Corzine campaign for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cino's game is up, and that effort is in the open,'' Corzine
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Cino, 36, of Demarest, who on Saturday faxed to reporters and
posted on the Internet a rambling statement asserting a ``pattern
of ethnic slurs on the part of Jon Corzine,'' did not return
repeated messages left by telephone at his home and by e-mail
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Corzine's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, played
a copy of a voice-mail message apparently left by Cino at 9:49 a.m.
on Friday, in which he demanded that a ``peace conference'' with
Corzine be held Monday _ or else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have more material, so I think it's in everybody's
best interest and the interest of the Democratic Party to have that
meeting on Monday, OK?'' the caller says on the voice-mail
extension of Karen Goldman, a Corzine campaign worker. ``This is
your last chance, Karen.''
</P>
<P>
   That night at 11:17, according to Joanne Corzine, Cino called
the Corzine home and again demanded to meet Corzine on Monday,
warning, ``We have so much dirt on him we can't decide which to
throw out first.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said the caller, his voice growing louder as the
15-minute call went on, added: ``If Jon would just meet with us
Monday, this would all go away. Your staff promised we would be
taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said he believed the matter of Corzine's statements
was now put to rest. ``I hope this is the last irrelevancy of the
2000 campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, said he had tried to maintain a ``studied neutrality''
in primary contests among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But a moment later, asked his opinion of Florio's character,
Torricelli responded after a long pause, ``I am somewhat less
neutral in some races than others.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     Be Prepared To Explain Your Loss 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I used to own a small business, but seven years ago I retired
and discontinued it. While I was in business, I purchased some
surplus for it for commercial use. I was unable to obtain financing
and finally abandoned the project. This equipment is still in
storage and eventually will be scrapped or sold at a fraction of
the cost. Is there any way I can deduct my loss from my current tax
liability?
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: You appear to be in luck.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller says that if you
didn't depreciate the cost on earlier income-tax forms and didn't
write off the cost when you shut down your business, you are
entitled to claim a business loss.
</P>
<P>
   If you get nothing for the equipment, then the loss is equal to
the amount you paid. If someone pays for it, then the loss would
amount to the cost minus the payment you receive.
</P>
<P>
   Report the details on IRS Schedule C, ``Profit or Loss from
Business.''
</P>
<P>
   Weller warns that because you may not have filed a Schedule C in
recent years _ and because the one you are going to file will
include no revenues, only an inventory loss _ there is a strong
chance that the IRS will ask you some follow-up questions.
</P>
<P>
   He advises you to attach an explanatory statement to your
return. You also should assemble any receipts and other documents
related to the purchase of the equipment, and you should dig out
your past returns and other business records in case you are asked
to confirm that you didn't write off the loss previously.
</P>
<P>
   I'm assuming that you still have all that stuff. Probably most
taxpayers have tossed out financial records going back seven years
and more. But that's unwise, especially when there are still some
loose ends, as in your case.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
High Return or Low Risk?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have about $10,000 that I need to invest in mutual funds or
something else that is not too risky, yet still has a high rate of
return. I plan to withdraw the money after about five years. What
do you advise?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: There isn't any satisfactory solution.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds and stocks have the potential for high rates of
return, but they are riskier than you seem to think. While there is
a strong chance that an investment in a diversified stock portfolio
will be worth more five years from now than it is today, there
certainly is no guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury issues or bank certificates of deposit are
virtually risk-free, but their returns _ in the neighborhood of 5
or 6 percent per year _ are not considered high.
</P>
<P>
   Those returns do, however, exceed the current rate of inflation.
So, if inflation remains low, your buying power would increase with
these investments.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that you will have to decide which is most
important to you: high return or low risk. It may be that you will
decide on a compromise, mixing stocks or mutual funds with
fixed-income investments in whatever proportion makes you
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Toward Zero Capital Gain
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am in the 28 percent federal tax bracket. Suppose I report
$1,000 in short-term capital gains and $1,000 in long-term capital
losses for 1999. Will my net capital gain be zero ($1,000 minus
$1,000) or $80 ($1,000 times 0.28 minus $1,000 times 0.2)?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  A: Your question may mystify some readers, so I'll expand on
it.
</P>
<P>
   For someone in the 28 percent tax bracket, short-term capital
gains are taxed at 28 percent, but long-term capital gains _
involving assets held more than one year _ are taxed at only 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to answer your question: No such distinction is made for
capital losses. Any capital loss _ long-term or short-term _ can be
fully offset against any capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you have $1,000 in short-term gains and $1,000 in
short-term losses, there is no net gain or loss and therefore no
capital-gains tax.

 &HT;    Drkoop.com studying prescription for recovery
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Drkoop.com Inc., the company named after the
famous former surgeon general, urged the public Monday not to pull
the plug on it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Stock in the Austin-based online health company dropped 41
percent Friday after its independent auditor cast doubt on its
ability to continue operating because of dwindling cash reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares sank an additional 19 percent Monday,
falling 72 cents to close at $2.97.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, drkoop.com said that it was still alive
and looking for ways out of its financial predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to distinguish between a `going concern'
opinion, which ... is basically the result of a calculation
involving cash burn and cash reserves, from an opinion as to a
company's viability,'' the company stated. ``It is not a prediction
that a company is about to fold. We continue to explore a host of
strategic financing options that we will announce as soon as is
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Auditors are required to file ``going concern'' letters when a
company has less than 12 months' worth of cash with which to
operate.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for drkoop.com _ who said the company is in a
quiet period until it files its next quarterly report on April 25 _
refused to elaborate on what financing options were being
considered. Analysts have said the company could solicit a private
investment or put itself up for sale but would have difficulty
raising money by selling more stock or issuing bonds because of its
poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors' letter, reported in drkoop.com's annual report
March 30, stated that there was ``substantial doubt'' about the
company's future because it did not have enough cash reserves to
cover its expenses through the end of the year.

WITH JAPAN'S PREMIER IN A COMA, SUCCESSION MOVES GET UNDER WAY
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: UPDATES throughout with more on succession fight, criticism
of how Aoki released information, quotes, political background; now
in 2 takes; no pickup; subs overline.) 
(js) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese politics were thrown into disarray Monday by
the news that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was in a coma after
suffering a stroke early Sunday, and was being kept alive on a
respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese did not learn of the gravity of Obuchi's condition
until early Monday, nearly 36 hours after he was hospitalized early
Sunday with complaints of extreme fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   By late Monday afternoon, televised reports said that Obuchi,
62, was breathing only with the assistance of a respirator, and
that he had been given drugs to reverse a catastrophic drop in
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently he is in a coma,'' said Mikio Aoki, the prime
minister's chief cabinet secretary, who assumed temporary control
of the government. In a formula usually reserved in Japan for
people near death, Aoki said that Obuchi's condition was ``beyond
prediction.''
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's illness set the political community into high gear.
Leaders of the long-governing Liberal Democratic Party planned to
meet, and there were indications that they would choose Yoshiro
Mori, secretary-general of the party, to act as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders mentioned were Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and
two former prime ministers, Kiichi Miyazawa, Obuchi's finance
minister, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, Obuchi's immediate predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders moved to prepare campaigns to unseat the
Liberal Democratic Party _ a conservative party despite its name _
in the coming general election.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts concluded Monday that the country would
almost certainly hold elections before July, when Japan plays host
to the Group of Eight summit meeting of economic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Obuchi became ill, politicians had begun
behind-the-scenes jockeying knowing that elections had to be called
by October. And for several months now, the government's popularity
has dwindled because of scandals involving public officials as well
as high unemployment and a faltering economy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although he quietly worked toward the prime minister's job for
much of his political life, Obuchi was widely written off as a
merely a transitional figure when his party selected him for the
job in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As a top aide to the longtime party kingmaker, and former prime
minister, Noboru Takeshita, Obuchi thrived not by staking out
positions of his own, but by doggedly serving his masters, by
patience and by projecting a sense of selflessness and loyalty to
the party.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Obuchi used many of those qualities to win
over a skeptical public. During his first year in office his most
winning attribute was his striking modesty. In a country where many
political leaders conduct themselves with a haughty arrogance,
Obuchi proclaimed that he had no ideas of his own, but would rely
on his ability to listen to others to guide his decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi pushed through a $400 billion plan for outlays to
stimulate the economy and to recapitalize banks to try to get the
economy growing, measures that were popular with the public. But
they indebted the government, and critics say that other tough
reforms, involving health care and corporate tax reform, were
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   His humble style won him strong public support, and soon, for
the first time in his political career, Obuchi began to show
glimmers of personal ambition. One of his goals was to serve a long
time as prime minister. He was also eager to welcome the summit
meeting of leading industrial nations, to take place in Okinawa in
July.
</P>
<P>
   But Obuchi's fixation on the summit meeting, which he counted on
to give him a boost in the elections, seemed to distract him from
other important matters that were working to undo his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months a string of high-level scandals affecting
everything from featherbedding by bank regulators to cover-ups of
police misdoings hurt his popularity. Obuchi was severely
criticized in the press for his handling of the scandals.
</P>
<P>
   When a police inspector was found to have gone to a spa to drink
and play mah-jongg with a local police commissioner rather than
inspect the troubled commissariat he was sent to examine, for
example, Obuchi remarked to Parliament that the inspector had been
``unlucky'' to have been caught.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, thickset and gravel-voiced, has quickly emerged as the
favorite within the Liberal Democratic Party to succeed Obuchi. He
heads the third-largest faction in the party and has close
relations with the party's main coalition partner, the
Buddhist-backed New Komeito party. He also has had a flawless
record of loyalty to Obuchi throughout his term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, if selected, will probably need to call new elections
quickly so that Japan will not be in the position of serving as
host to the economic summit meeting under interim leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A likely opponent might be Yukio Hatoyama, a wealthy heir of an
old political family who heads the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Few people expect Aoki to serve as anything other than an
interim leader. Already in his 24 hours at the helm, he has faced
mounting criticism of his exercise of authority, particularly the
way he broke the news. The public was spoon-fed information about
the crisis, with no news until 21 hours after Obuchi's
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   For many the situation seemed to highlight the creaky nature of
Japan's rules of succession and to underscore the ingrained
attitude among those in power that the public's right to know
counts for little in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One deception widely criticized Monday was that the prime
minister's office had told the press corps early Sunday that Obuchi
had risen at 6 a.m. and was spending the day at his official
residence. It was learned later that the prime minister had checked
into Juntendo University Hospital at 1 a.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the wartime government announcements, deceiving
the people,'' said Atsuo Nakamura, an independent member of
Parliament. ``Even 50 years later, the administration is following
the same pattern, hiding problems and putting off announcements.
All the while, they are having discussions on how to advance their
own interests arising from the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Aoki, who has announced most of the public information about
Obuchi's condition, first told the nation of a problem shortly
after 11 p.m. on Sunday. Even then, he strove to minimize the
problem, saying in a four-minute statement that the prime minister
had remained conscious and had been driven to the hospital in a
private car rather than by ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   But by Monday afternoon Aoki was giving a different account.
Looking grim as he spoke to the press, Aoki said Obuchi had been
placed on a respirator by 9:50 p.m. on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by the press corps, Aoki acknowledged that this meant
that the prime minister had already lost consciousness well before
the acting prime minister's first vague statements to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper editorials speculated that Aoki had extended the
information vacuum as long as possible to favor the kind of
back-room discussions over a new leader that define Japanese
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics have focused on the barely scripted mechanism by
which Aoki assumed authority: He said he had been asked to do so in
a conversation with Obuchi that apparently had no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's Constitution is vague about what should happen when a
leader suddenly vacates power. Aoki relied on the so-called cabinet
law, which allows a prime minister to designate his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Isao Sato, an emeritus professor of law at Sophia University,
said: ``In the earlier times, when the cabinet was formed the prime
minister would designate an acting prime minister just in case
something happened to him. They were informally called deputy prime
ministers, making it clear who was to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sato said the practice had fallen into disuse because the heads
of various Liberal Democratic Party factions resented the selection
of an official who would have a leg up in the next succession
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, with the prospect of an emergency succession looming for
the first time in 20 years, many politicians criticized the law's
vagueness.
</P>

   ``This is not based on the Constitution, and it is a big problem
that two people can decide the supreme authority of the state all
by themselves, at their own discretion,'' said Naoto Kan, the
policy director of the Democratic Party, Japan's leading opposition
group. ``This has all occurred without witnesses.''

Sunday afternoon, mambo madness takes over when the Ene Hair Salon
in Manhattan's East Village turns into a dance palace. It is easy
to become indifferent to the oddities of the East Village, a
neighborhood where pierced noses and spiky dyed hair are common.
Yet there is something particularly off-kilter, like a campy John

State of Israel.'' Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday that he
does not expect a military confrontation after Israeli troops

which are made largely from donated fabrics and things he can buy
cheaply on the street, like baseball caps and sweatshirts, and

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe because he's a band leader, Tito Puente can do
a lot with his voice. It's not what he says, which more often than
not he's said in his half million interviews before, but how he
says it: a low, gravelly, been-around intonation, that goes down a
half octave on the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   Tito, you tell him _ everybody, wherever he goes in New York,
calls him Tito _ you're almost 77, you're on the road more than
you're home, you have 118 records and CDs. Why do you need another
one?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Puente says. ``I'm a really creative person. I
always try to stay up-to-date. The most difficult thing is to
maintain.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking now with his hands. Did we mention that whether he's got
a drumstick in them or not, a lot of the time Puente is using his
hands?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody'' _ raising a hand the height of his none-too-high
head _ ``gets  &UR; there &LR; . To stay there is the hard part. A hundred
and eighteen records, I don't know anybody else who has that many.
Sinatra, he came close, I think he had 80 or 90.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen, now, here comes the voice, dropping like Louis Prima.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we ain't worried about  &UR; him &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Where to start with Tito Puente, as much of the New York
landscape as Yankee Stadium? On stage, with his rubbery baby face,
he mugs and clowns around and plays the timbales and remains,
despite his age, an astonishing dancer. He has five Grammys. On
Thursday, at Yale, he will be awarded a Chubb Fellowship. He will
be honored, according to Robert Farris Thompson, the professor who
directs the Chubb, as ``the foremost exponent of that world-class
music, mambo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your hard-hitting classics like `Albaniquito,' `Mambo Tipico,'
`Mambo Diablo' have all the richness of Ravel or Debussy but
surpass them because they can be danced to, and therefore belong to
the people,'' Thompson wrote to Puente, informing him of the award.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lot more reverence than was being accorded to Puente
the other day in the RPM studio in the Village, where he was
recording the latest album, ``Cara a Cara,'' with another legendary
band leader, the pianist Eddie Palmieri. Puente's wife, Margaret,
and Palmieri's wife, Ida, are glued to the television, waiting to
see Puente's daughter, Audrey, the new weather forecaster on
WNBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   But when Puente goes out to grab a bite, attention is paid.
People wave and greet him, and Puente, whose nickname is El Rey,
the King, and who, in kingly and/or Latin manner, has taken the arm
of the reporter, always smiles back.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting thing to go walking in the neighborhood with
you, Tito, he is told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he says. ``And it isn't even my neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood of Puente's childhood is Spanish Harlem. His
parents come from Puerto Rico, his father works in a razor blade
factory. When Puente is 10, a younger brother dies in a fall from a
fire escape. Puente, who often says he was ``born in rhythm,''
drums on whatever is in his path: walls, garbage cans.
</P>
<P>
   His mother sees that he has music lessons, though this is not
always easy. Tito's father is a gambler; to get the 25 cents for
Tito's lesson, his mother goes through his father's pockets when he
is asleep. Tito starts with piano, then moves to drums, then
timbale. At 16, Tito drops out of Central Commercial High and
becomes a full-time musician.
</P>
<P>
   Puente serves in the Navy during World War II, studies at
Juilliard, and becomes a regular at the Palladium Ballroom. His
musical contribution is combining Latin and jazz. It also seems
that he has been given a gift, to make people happy; what he
especially wants is for them to get up and dance. He works as many
as 300 gigs a year. Even now, he doesn't turn down work _ you turn
down work, you lose your musicians. There are two marriages and
three children. The first marriage, which produces a son, breaks up
because of the company he keeps, according to Puente.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's parents were very religious people. I was hanging
out with these guys who were smoking marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   Innocent, now, as a choirboy on display. ``I wasn't smoking
marijuana, but her father thought I was, so that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that a fact? Puente did not smoke marijuana? He would have
been the first jazz musician in the history of the universe who did
not. ``I guess it's how you feel,'' Puente says, vaguely, before
changing the subject. ``Everything in moderation.''
</P>
<P>
   The second marriage takes place four or five years ago with the
children from that union, then in their 20s, serving as their
parents' best man and maid of honor. Puente's first wife, he
explains, does not believe in divorce and she is ``a very nice
person.'' Then comes a time Puente is concerned that his children
have his ``legitimate'' name. The marriage of the man who's been
host to thousands of parties is held in a judge's chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Was there a honeymoon?
</P>
<P>
   You've got to be _ say this in a look, now _  &UR; cuh-razy &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not taken a vacation in my whole life. Let me ask you a
question: have you ever known a musician to take a vacation? You
know when you're on vacation? When the phone don't ring. Maybe I
should have, but I never had the time. I don't know if I could take
it. I'd be nervous after the third day.''

U.S. HAS VISAS FOR CUBAN BOY'S FATHER, 5 OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to update and rewrite. Changes hed and byline.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ State Department officials say they now have visas for
the father of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and five others, and
President Fidel Castro of Cuba said the father could be ready to
travel to the United States as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The six visas could be issued Tuesday morning to the father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and five of the 28 Cubans who had applied for
the trip to the United States, said James Rubin, a State Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly when Gonzalez would arrive, and how he would take
custody of his son if he got here, were still very much in doubt
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government wants to send a large delegation on the
trip to retrieve the boy, a group that includes a psychiatrist,
classmates of Elian, Gonzalez's Cuban family and the president of
the National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, an adviser to Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The six visas that were granted were for Elian's father,
stepmother, an infant half-brother, a cousin, his pediatrician and
his kindergarten teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The other visas are still being considered, American officials
said. The U.S. Interest Section in Havana ``will be submitting a
list of questions to the Cuban government'' as it considers the
other applications to travel to the United States with the boy's
father, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why such a large delegation was necessary, the
father's lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, said he would ``not support
every name on the list,'' but that the pediatrician and family
members made perfect sense if the delegation must wait several
weeks for a decision in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Gonzalez was ``not willing to come alone and sit for
nine weeks'' without his family.
</P>
<P>
   But as the State Department prepared the legal paperwork to
allow the boy's father into the United States, it was still unclear
exactly how a transfer of the boy, either from Elian's Miami
relatives to federal officials, or from the Miami family to the
father himself, would be accomplished in the volatile atmosphere
surrounding the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   American immigration officials had demanded that Elian's Miami
relatives sign a document by Tuesday morning saying they would hand
the boy over if they lost a court fight in the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, in May to keep him. If they did not
sign it, immigration officials said, they would revoke the boy's
immigration status and begin the process of ultimately removing the
boy from the home here, which is guarded by Cuban exiles who say
they will not allow the government to take the child.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, immigration officials dropped their demand to
revoke Elian's status. An immigration official, who asked not to be
identified, told The Associated Press that Justice Department
officials were now working on a plan for the transfer of the boy.
No agreement, apparently, was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, said only that ``our goal is to reunite
Elian and his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not whether we will transfer Elian to his
father,'' Cardona said, ``but when and how.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that the boy's Miami family was ``making this very,
very difficult for us.'' But he said he expected the relatives here
to agree to some kind of eventual transfer, but with conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Havana, Castro and the boy's father were the focus
of a rally of about 3,000 college students from the Caribbean and
Latin America. The students called for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Elian! Down with the lie!'' the students chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives have said they will appeal the case to
the U.S. Supreme Court if they lose in the appeals court in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If American officials are willing to hand the child over to him
immediately, the father said, he would leave for the United States
as early as Tuesday, now that his visa has cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to talk to any kidnapper, nor accept any
condition,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is highly unlikely that any transfer would be quick and
easy, as about 100 demonstrators again gathered outside the boy's
house in Little Havana _ thousands more are on call to join them at
a moment's notice _ all swearing that they will never allow the boy
to be taken from the home.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives have said they do not want the child
to be traumatized in any way, but his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
said last week that he would not bring the boy out of his home and
that government officials would have to come in and get him.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the boy's Miami relatives said that Elian's
father was verbally abusive to him on the telephone and that he
told the boy that his mother, who drowned in a crossing with him
from Cuba in November, was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're preposterous,'' Craig said of the accusations. ``They
have a close and loving relationship, father and son.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was a desperate, 11th-hour effort to try and paint
the father as something he is not.

LISTEN UP! IT'S TIME FOR MOBSPEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)

 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS has provided us jackass critics with a glossary of Mafia
terms to help us understand ``Falcone.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you know, for example, that ``whacked'' (or ``wacked,'' as
CBS spells it) means ``being killed off''?
</P>
<P>
   Also, ``racket'' (or ``raquet,'' as CBS spells it) means ``a
fraudulent or dishonest business.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, CBS!
</P>
<P>
   I'm not so sure about CBS' spelling on racket/raquet/racquet,
but I know that ``Falcone'' is an incredibly whacky, if not wacky,
TV show.
</P>
<P>
   One indecisive ``wiseguy'' (``a member of the crew who is not an
official member of the mob'') is minced with an ice pick by someone
who apparently is an official member of the mob.
</P>
<P>
   Two others are garroted, quicker than they can say ``salud''
(``the Italian tern for `hello,' which has many translations in the
mob world'').
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, I don't know what an ``Italian tern'' is, but I
hope there isn't a hunting season.
</P>
<P>
   A ``stoolie'' (``a person functioning as a decoy, an informer'')
is spiked on one of those sharp things that used to be used for
discarded paper. Several others are merely gunned down, practically
an act of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   All of this ``wacking'' is terribly violent by network
prime-time standards, but it proves to be as addictive as ever for
those of us outside the wiseguy ``raquet.''
</P>
<P>
   It can also be quite suspenseful, especially when undercover FBI
agent Joe Pistone (series star Jason Gedrick) could get whacked at
any moment.
</P>
<P>
   The show is based on the real Pistone's exploits, and on the
movie (``Donnie Brasco'') inspired by Pistone.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is ``millionairizing'' (running a show in highly
concentrated form, in hopes of building an audience) its new Mafia
drama. It has ordered nine hours of ``Falcone,'' and will air it
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, next Monday, next
Tuesday and on April 12.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``ratings'' (official statistical indications of public
acceptance) allow, ``Falcone'' will find a place on the fall
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise it will be ``canceled'' (a network term for whacked)
after its maiden nine hours.
</P>
<P>
   Pistone is two years into his dangerous gig, using the name Joe
Falcone, when the show opens.
</P>
<P>
   He has penetrated the Volonte crime family in Brooklyn, where
Victor ``The Pick'' Mura (James Russo) and Santino ``Sonny Boy''
Napoli (Titus Welliver) are set to square off after family boss
Carlo Volonte meets an earlier demise than he'd anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Volonte's successor, Raymond ``Madman'' Ricci (Eric ``Curled
Lip'' Roberts), wants his squabbling captains Mura and Napoli to
make peace. But Ricci is confined to a mental hospital, so there's
not much he can do.
</P>
<P>
   Pistone/Falcone has to thread through the delicate maze of mob
loyalties and align himself with the right guy, or his FBI
assignment will end fruitlessly.
</P>
<P>
   He also has the equally delicate task of squeezing quality time,
here and there, for his wife, Maggie (Amy Carlson), and their two
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Along its route, ``Falcone'' picks up reliable supporting help
such as Patti LuPone in the role of an assistant district attorney
with her own agenda; the recognizable Mike Starr as a school board
member with a gambling weakness; and Robert John Burke as Falcone's
FBI handler.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic crux of the series is the relationship between
Falcone and Sonny Napoli (Sonny Napoli! ``Sunny Naples''?).
</P>
<P>
   Falcone seems to have won the genuine affection of the volatile
mobster, who has a sort of soft side when he's not being a
homicidal maniac. One slipup, though, and Falcone will be fried
Sonny side up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' keeps putting the possibility out there. For one
thing, there's a henchman named Jimmy Suits (Sonny Marinelli), who
doesn't trust Falcone.
</P>
<P>
   Start with it from the top, and you might find ``Falcone''
addictive. The writing is certainly above average, the black
leather-coated mobsters make for lively viewing and the doe-eyed
Gedrick, in the title role, has always projected the vulnerable air
of a man on thin ice.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if it weren't for HBO's ``The Sopranos,'' ``Falcone''
might earn raves. But ``The Sopranos'' has raised the bar; its
startling success is based on a knack for making its Jersey
mobsters refreshingly life-size, and for splashing sardonic humor
into its own take on life in the mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falcone'' lacks that sense of humor and gives the Mafia more
of a conventional Hollywood slant. But within those confines, it's
a highly watchable trip through mob mayhem and undercover jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Call this one ``The Mezzo-Sopranos,'' which CBS might define as
``an opry tern for a voice with a lower register than a Tony
Soprano.''

ARM INJURY SIDELINES YANKEES' WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Bernie Williams might not be able to play
center field for the first few games of the Yankees' season because
of a strained triceps in his right arm. But Williams says the
injury only hurts when he is throwing, so he figures to be in the
lineup as the designated hitter until he gets better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it'll be only a few days,'' said Williams, who
cannot recall when he got hurt. ``Probably making a throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee will start in center field and Shane Spencer _ who
will usually be the DH this year _ will start in left. Ledee, who
hit .351 with a team-high seven home runs in spring training, was
to hit sixth in Monday night's lineup, an indication of Manager Joe
Torre's growing confidence in the young outfielder. Tino Martinez,
a left-handed hitter, will bat fifth and Ledee, also a left-handed
hitter, will hit sixth, all but inviting the opposing manager to
bring in left-handed in the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than insert the switch-hitting Jorge Posada between
Martinez and Ledee, however, Torre will use them back to back, to
get Ledee higher in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   In the days to come, the Yankees could turn to the newly
acquired Lance Johnson to play center field. Johnson joined the
team Monday, arriving with his signature goatee shaved off _ the
first time since he was a rookie, he figures, that he has no facial
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Torre met with Johnson and told him, as Johnson knew, that he
would be used as an occasional pinch-hitter. ``Or I might get into
the game in the late innings to steal bases,'' Johnson said. ``I'm
just glad the Yankees called.'' &QL;

   There is a cheerleading convention at the hotel where the
Yankees are staying, and Monday, Derek Jeter poked his head out of
his room to put down a room service tray _ and was spotted by one
of the cheerleaders. After that, a group of cheerleaders from
Clifton, N.J., stood outside his door and did cheers for the
Yankees.

 &HT;    Fans wished upon a star _ and got one
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Around here, where the Reds became baseball's first
professional team exactly 132 seasons ago, Opening Day is a
religion. Schools unofficially close and so do workplaces. There
are marching bands from the center of town to the ballpark, along
with banners everywhere and a mighty dose of magic.
</P>
<P>
   So this Ken Griffey Jr. thing was almost too much to take for
those already Reds hot. When he trotted into view Monday at Cinergy
Field during pregame introductions, the place exploded with cameras
flashing and voices screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the star from a local high school was back after
an 11-year pitstop with the Mariners, and the ovation wouldn't
stop. According to Jack McKeon, the Reds manager who has seen
slightly more than everything during his 50 years in the game, ``It
gave me chills.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was Ken Griffey Sr., the stoic father, who played on
Cincinnati's Big Red Machine during the 1970s. As a bench coach for
the Reds these days, he leaned against the front railing of the
home dugout while the 55,596 spectators hugged his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little tear in my eye,'' Griffey Sr., said, before his
wife, Alberta, shook her head nearby. She said she had no reaction
to the moment. That's because the stadium's elevator operator was
late in getting her to her section in the stands. Alberta laughed,
before saying, ``I did get to see his first at-bat with the Reds,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Alberta could have missed. It was rather forgettable. So
was Griffey's only other at-bat, before a steady rain ended the
Reds' game against the Brewers in a 3-3 tie after five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, most among the crowd stood in the first inning, when
the Brewers' Steve Woodard induced Griffey Jr. to swing weakly at
two change-ups around a couple of balls. Then, the man of the
moment popped out to third baseman Jose Hernandez with Barry Larkin
at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I nervous?'' Griffey said, who grounded to shortstop in
his other at bat. ``Yeah, I was nervous. If you weren't nervous in
that situation, you'd be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's Griffey Jr.'s situation: Designated Savior for the Reds,
that's all.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the other stuff involving the Reds' resurgence after
nearly a decade of stagnation. They won 96 games last year by
having the manager of the year, the NL Rookie of the Year, and the
executive of the year. And even before Griffey signed for anywhere
between $40 million and $80 million less to play for the Reds
instead of the Mariners, Cincinnati's Opening Day was sold out in 3
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you add Griffey into the mix, you have what former Reds
Hall of Famer Joe Morgan said is the player ``who is doing more for
this franchise in a short time than Johnny Bench and the rest of us
didn't do for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all overwhelming for Griffey Jr., 30, who is only two home
runs shy of 400 along his way to catching Hank Aaron's 755.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although Griffey fields with the grace of Mays and hits
with the flair of Mantle, he doesn't have the power of Mother
Nature. Not yet, anyway. So it rained on Griffey Jr.'s parade, but
all of those soggy screamers couldn't care less.

GORE DENOUNCES DISPARITIES IN MINORITY ACCESS TO COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 8th graf, In a chapel ..., to correct spelling of
campaign manager's last name to Brazile, sted Brazille.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Speaking at the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s alma
mater on the eve of the anniversary of his death, Vice President Al
Gore called Monday for programs to narrow the ``digital divide''
that has left minorities with unequal access to computers and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, referred
repeatedly to the famous final speech that King delivered 32 years
ago Monday night, when the civil rights leader declared that he had
been to the mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take this mountaintop moment,'' he told about 500
students at Morehouse College, ``and squander the resources that we
call the surplus on a tax cut for the wealthy, on a risk that is
designed not to lift up those that are in need, but to give more to
those who have much, what will happen to those that are waiting for
the help that ought to be extended to them?''
</P>
<P>
   The want ads, Gore continued, are filled with high-paying jobs
that cannot be filled because of inadequate training. ``And
simultaneously,'' he said, ``we have hundreds of thousands and
millions who have the ability, the curiosity, the desire to learn
and to succeed but have not had the opportunity and the access.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, Gore said, will come from government financing to
place computers with Internet access in every classroom and
library, to train teachers in new technologies, to integrate
computers into the full scholastic curriculum, to build computer
learning centers in needy communities and to bring Internet access
to every household. He said the country should set a national goal
of making every student computer literate by the eighth grade. He
did not disclose a price for his recommendations, many of which
have already been proposed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In maintaining his campaign's focus on education, Gore has
spoken on this topic several times. But by doing so at Morehouse,
one of the country's elite historically black private colleges, he
again underscored the importance of black voters to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls show that Bush is a solid favorite across the
South, the Gore campaign believes it can break the Bush
stranglehold in selected states with the help of a heavy turnout of
loyal black Democrats. One of those states is Georgia, which the
Democratic ticket won narrowly in 1992 and lost narrowly in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapel named for King, Gore shared the stage Monday with
one of King's top lieutenants, Andrew Young, former mayor of
Atlanta, and with King's eldest son, Martin Luther King 3rd, now
the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Gore
also made a point of introducing his campaign manager, Donna
Brazile, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Gore echoed government officials who fear that
the computer divide may soon exacerbate existing racial disparities
in education, employment and income. A variety of recent studies
have shown that while Internet access is expanding rapidly,
persistent gaps remain in access based on income, race, education
level and region.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department study released last summer found that
households with incomes of $75,000 and higher were 20 times more
likely to have access to the Internet than those at the lowest
income levels, and more than nine times as likely to own a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Though disparities have narrowed in recent years among high
earners, the study found racial gaps that could not be explained by
differences in income alone. Among households with earnings from
$15,000 to $35,000, for instance, more than 32 percent of white
families owned computers, compared with only 19 percent of black
and Hispanic families. Seventeen percent of white households had
home Internet access, compared with 8 percent of black and Hispanic
households.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the gap threatened to further the perception that
minorities are politically disenfranchised. ``This new technology
of the Internet and computer communication can close that digital
divide,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore was also the headline attraction at a expensive fund-raiser
here Monday night for the Democratic National Committee. With a
price tag of $50,000 a person, the event was expected to raise more
than $1.5 million for the committee, said Jenny Backus, the
committee's press secretary. The committee can use the money to
promote Democratic themes and candidates, including Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The list of contributors included Anne Cox Chambers, the
chairwoman of Atlanta Newspapers Inc., which publishes The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, and Michael Coles, the Georgia cookie magnate
who has run unsuccessfully for Congress. Other contributors
included prominent Atlanta companies like Coca-Cola, United Parcel
Service and Bell South.

   The outstanding image of opening day was not Ken Griffey Jr.'s
first at-bat as a Cincinnati Red, Griffey's first putout in center
field for the Reds or the reactions of Ken Griffey Sr. to his son's
first at-bat and putout as a Red.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was Monty Stratton's right prosthetic leg, bent and
shelved inside a display case at Christie's, which plans to auction
the late Chicago White Sox pitcher's wooden limb (along with a
tuxedo, signed ball and minor league uniform) Wednesday as part of
an auction that features Joe DiMaggio memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Stratton's right leg was amputated after an accident he had
while hunting rabbits in 1938. His inspiring struggle to return to
play with the prosthesis after World War II was portrayed in a
popular 1948 film starring Jimmy Stewart.

   So, a man posts a 36-23 major league record, valiantly returns
to play minor league baseball on a hinged wooden leg, dies of
cancer in 1982 and his wooden leg (and accompanying ephemera) is
put up for sale for $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tacky mercantilism like this _ and who knows how much even
ickier memorabilia is being sold on eBay _ is not new. Recently,
the late White Sox owner Bill Veeck's wooden leg, a most renowned
prosthesis, sold for $10,000 at a Chicago auction, and Ty Cobb's
dentures sold for $7,500 at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   The DiMaggio items include what is reputed to be the last home
jersey he wore before his retirement (projected to sell for a
minimum of $130,000), one of his last pairs of pinstriped pants, a
driver's license, passport, MasterCard and Screen Actors Guild
card. No Mr. Coffees. If you have $30,000 to spare, how about
buying the Yankee Clipper's gas-powered golf cart?
</P>
<P>
   None of DiMaggio's items were as personal as some of those
removed from a 1997 Mickey Mantle memorabilia auction. Although his
prescription vials, socks and eyeglasses were taken off the block,
a lock of his hair was not.
</P>
<P>
   When Griffey Jr. is old or gone, one can only speculate about
what will be auctioned off from his world. The pen with which he
signed his Reds contract? The socks he wore to the signing? His
first video-game joystick? The cap that, when worn backward,
enraged Buck Showalter when he managed the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, of course, was the star of ESPN's early opening day
coverage. He did not dominate ESPN2's new ``Baseball 2Day'' studio
show, but his presence hovered over the show and the subsequent
rain-delayed Reds-Brewers game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Griffey makes no pretense of being Neville Chamberlain,''
Peter Gammons of ``Baseball 2Day'' said. One would hope not. The
former British prime minister appeased Adolf Hitler in 1938 and
played a weak center field.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN showed the standing ovation Griffey received when he was
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Griffey Sr. was seen trying not to beam.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:20 p.m. Eastern time came Junior's first at-bat. At 1:23,
he popped out.
</P>
<P>
   With shock in his voice, ESPN's Jon Miller said during the game
that Barry Larkin's failed attempt to stretch a single to a double
``has taken the bat out of Griffey's hand.'' How disrespectful of
Larkin, on Junior's great day!
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, where ESPN carried the Cubs-Cardinals game, Chris
Berman felt the strange compulsion to apologize when it was
announced minutes before the first pitch that Mark McGwire would
not be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't something we drummed up,'' Berman said. Berman
seemed to be down on himself for not having divined McGwire's
malady during a pregame chat.
</P>
<P>
   Berman could have simply said: ``McGwire's back hurts. He's out
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury gave Craig Paquette a chance to substitute for
McGwire and prompted Berman to say, ``So it's that famous
Sosa-Paquette home run duel we've anticipated all winter.'' Then
Paquette homered in his first at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Long periods of time with Berman require listening to his
onslaught of nicknames, some of them amusing, some of them forced.
The Cubs reliever Andrew ``Quiche'' Lorraine? Todd ``Good
Housekeeping'' Zeile? You decide.
</P>
<P>
   What can be decided is the relief at hearing Ralph Kiner in the
booth for the Padres-Mets game.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest disappointment at seeing Shea Stadium on the tube
for the first time this season was spotting the name and logo of
ESuperstars.com, an online company, plastered all over the wall of
the Mets' dugout. No spot in a ballpark is free of advertiser and
sponsor messages.
</P>
<P>
   Had the game been in San Diego, fans would have witnessed how
the Padres made the Sycuan Casino, which is run by Native
Americans, a ``presenting sponsor'' of the team's entire season.
You can hardly go anywhere at Qualcomm Stadium (or on the team's
Web site) without bumping into Sycuan.

U.S. COLONEL IS ACCUSED OF DELAY IN REPORTING CRIMES BY HIS WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A U.S. Army colonel who once led the government's
anti-drug campaign in Colombia was linked Monday for the first time
to an international drug-smuggling case in which his wife has
pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The colonel, James C. Hiett, is expected to plead guilty on
April 17 to charges accusing him of failing to advise government
officials as soon as possible that his wife, Laurie Anne Hiett, was
engaged in money laundering, according to court papers filed by an
assistant U.S. attorney, Lee G. Dunst.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation by the U.S. Customs Service, Mrs. Hiett,
36, admitted in January that she had conspired to smuggle more than
$700,000 worth of heroin out of Bogota last year and had flown to
New York at least twice to pick up payments for the drugs. She said
she had hidden the scheme from her husband, who led all U.S.
military activity in the country from July 1998 until August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never told him what I was doing,'' she said in court.
</P>
<P>
   A three-month inquiry conducted last year by the Army Criminal
Investigation Division cleared Hiett, saying he had no prior
knowledge of his wife's crimes. Harvey Perritt, an Army spokesman,
refused to comment Monday on the colonel's case other than to say
that he is still serving as a training officer at Fort Monroe in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Dunst also refused to comment on Hiett's expected guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her plea in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, Mrs.
Hiett said she had shipped six brown paper packages of what she
thought was cocaine from Bogota to New York City. The shipments, in
fact, contained heroin, according to chemical tests.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hiett also told the court that she had flown twice to
Queens to pick up payments for the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Col. Hiett carry a maximum penalty of three
years in prison.

MICROSOFT'S NEIGHBORS APPREHENSIVE ABOUT RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ As news of the antitrust decision filtered off
the Redmond Microsoft campus Monday, neighboring business people
voiced apprehension about the company's possible dismantling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bum ruling,'' said Dot Chase, a membership
representative at Bellevue Place Club, an exercise facility popular
with Microsoft employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree with it. I'm a big supporter of Microsoft.
They've taken the time to do the research, recruit the best people
and develop the best product,'' Chase said. ``I don't think they
should be punished for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good for them if they appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg's Bellevue Cycle manager Anthony Devita said he dreaded
possible changes in software compatibility that may arise if the
company splits as a result of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like things the way they are. I like the standardization,''
said Devita, who uses Microsoft software on his work and home
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared about a break up. I'm afraid we're going to have
the same problems as we did with the phone companies back in the
'80s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer management consultants sipping pints of amber ale
inside Chadfield's Sports Pub in Bellevue were sympathetic to
Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who worked hard and now a lot of competitors are
trying to bring him down,'' said Mike Riley, a consultant from
Leeds, England, visiting Bellevue on business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chopping up the company would be a mistake,'' added David
Jastrebski, a Seattle computer consultant joining Riley for a brew.
``I think this is a good exercise for the U.S. judicial system to
go through but I think divesting is wrong. Microsoft as an entity
has done good things for America. It's given me a job. It's given
lots of people jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up the company will hurt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Microsoft campus in Redmond, employees _ some outside
smoking cigarettes, others jogging across campus _ were
tight-lipped following the announcement, deferring questions to
corporate offices.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the news was still too fresh for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a decision? What was it?'' said one employee as he
jogged to his car.

DUCKS' KOHN GETS TWO SCARES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Winger Ladislav Kohn isn't taking any more chances --
not after what happened to him Saturday and Sunday. Kohn barely
escaped a devastating injury against the Kings when he was hit
between the eyes by the side of Luc Robitaille's skate as the Los
Angeles star was falling down.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to get Kohn talking about learning to play with
a visor over the summer. But that process was speeded up Sunday
when he was hit in the left eye by deflected shot in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that is a sign that I better wear one,'' said Kohn, who
played with a visor on Monday versus Nashville. ``The skate was the
first warning, the puck the second, and I don't want a third
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn, who played with a visor in juniors, compares playing with
a visor to wearing glasses, but he said ``it's worth it to save
your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn's eye was almost completely shut within a half hour of the
accident and he spent the rest of the day icing it and draining the
blood that had accumlated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a very fun day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg insisted that Ducks were not
going to have one eye on the scoreboard Monday, looking for the
Edmonton-San Jose result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not during a game,'' he said of scoreboard watching. ``Our
entire focus has to be on ourselves. If we focus on anything else
it's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Ducks second line of Matt Cullen, Kip Miller and Ted
Donato, which had provided some much needed support for the team's
No. 1 line since Miller was picked up from Pittsburg on Jan. 29,
came into Monday's game having only one Cullen assist to show for
its efforts in the previous four games since the trio combined for
three goals and five points in Anaheim's 5-2 win over the Kings on
March 21. Cullen came into the Nashville game in the midst of a
14-game goal-scoring drought.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nothing comes easy for the Ducks. Heading into Monday's game,
Anaheim had outshot Phoenix and the Kings 57-25 in a stretch of 105
minutes, but the Ducks had to rally from two goals down to beat
Phoenix 4-3 in overtime and lost to the Kings 2-1 despite holding
them without a shot for nearly 24 1/2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks did set a new club record when they held the Kings
without a shot. Anaheim's previous low was two shots allowed.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Ducks signed Colgate University Center Andy McDonald to a
two-year contract. McDonald (5-10, 185) scored 25 goals and 58
points in 34 games in his senior season. He recently was named a
Hobey Baker Award finalist awarded to the top U.S. collegiate
player.

CHARLES ELSON, THEATRICAL DESIGNER AND DRAMA EDUCATOR, DIES AT 90 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Britain, Conn., Wash., Ill., Pa . )  (DW) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Elson, a prolific designer who devised the sets and
lighting for scores of productions on Broadway and in London, died
on March 30 at his home in Armonk, N.Y. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the Yale School of Drama, Elson received his first
Broadway credit in July 1945 with a modern version of Shakespeare's
``As You Like It,'' imported to the President Theater on West 48th
Street from a production at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The production was not well liked by critics, but Elson's sleek
and utilitarian designs were. The production was the first of a
string of Broadway designs for Elson, including productions of
``Kiss Me, Kate,'' ``Henry IV'' and ``Private Lives,'' with
Tallulah Bankhead.
</P>
<P>
   Elson traced his affinity for the theater to his childhood in
Chicago, where he became involved in the theater program at the
Hull House, a settlement home. The experience sparked a desire to
teach, which took him to several universities, including Yale and
the City University of New York, where he helped establish master's
and doctoral programs in theater.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Broadway, Elson was active in dance and opera _ his set
for ``Madame Butterfly'' at the Metropolitan Opera was used for
more than 20 years _ and on the West End in London. He also served
as a cultural attache for the State Department in Southeast Asia
during the early 1970s, and edited two volumes of technical writing
on stage design.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Alexandra, of New York; a brother,
Alex, of Chicago; and a sister, Elizabeth Cohen of Newtown, Pa.

7 VILLAGERS IN KASHMIR SLAIN DURING ANTI-POLICE PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  ( CORRECTS number of those killed in last graf. ) 
(ms) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ Seven demonstrators against recent killings of
villagers by the police were killed in Kashmir Monday and at least
another four were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were part of a march of about 1,000 people from
their villages to the district police headquarters in Anantnag.
They were gunned down outside a police camp in the village of
Barakpura.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the state of Kashmir suggested that the killings
Monday were committed by militants, while separatist leaders
charged that police officers had fired on the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The police themselves originally reported that officers in the
special operations group of the state police _ charged with
combating the 11-year-old insurgency in the state _ had fired on
the marchers after being pelted with stones and perhaps even fired
on. But they later said an examination of the bodies indicated that
the shots came from behind the protesters and had been fired by
militants.
</P>
<P>
   People who had marched further back in the procession, and who
had not actually witnessed the shootings, accused the police of
shooting the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths Monday continued a cycle of violence that began with
the killing of more than 30 Sikh villagers in the state of Kashmir
two weeks ago, on the eve of President Clinton's visit to India.
</P>
<P>
   On March 25 the police killed 5 men who were supposedly
implicated in the crime. Officials said the men were separatist
Islamic militants fighting Indian rule of Kashmir. But villagers in
the area said some of the men shot were innocent local residents.

LAWYER FOR ELIAN'S FATHER IS NO STRANGER TO CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs 8th graf, The Rev. Joan ..., to expand on how Craig was
recruited and is being paid; rearranges after that, to raise
background grafs higher and tighten.) 
 (With CUBAN-BOY) 
(rk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the wall of Gregory Craig's office at the
powerhouse law firm Williams &AMP; Connolly here is a fading photograph
taken 14 years ago of Craig shaking hands with a gaunt 60-year-old
Cuban-American man at Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was taken the day in 1986 when the man, Col. Ricardo
Montero Duque, was released from a Cuban jail after serving 25
years for counterrevolutionary violence. Duque was the last
imprisoned senior officer from the brigade of Cuban exiles who
stormed the shores of Cuba in the futile Bay of Pigs invasion of
1961.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro of Cuba set Duque free at the urging of
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who sent his senior foreign policy aide,
Craig, to Cuba to accompany him home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Craig is embroiled in another situation involving
Cuban-American relations, this time as the lawyer for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, father of the 6-year-old shipwreck victim, Elian
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's appearance as Gonzalez's lawyer has been a bit of a
surprise to official Washington, which last saw him delivering a
defense of presidential peccadilloes before the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton enlisted Craig to coordinate his legal and
political defense against impeachment charges in part because of
longtime personal ties _ Craig was friendly with Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton at Yale Law School in the early 1970s. But
the White House also sought Craig's services because of his
well-tuned ear for congressional politics and ability to pursue an
aggressive legal strategy.
</P>
<P>
   When he was approached by representatives of church groups
sympathetic to Gonzalez, he accepted the job after consulting with
top officials of the White House, the Department of Justice and the
State Department, where Craig had been director of the policy
planning staff earlier in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, until recently the general
secretary of the National Council of Churches, recruited Craig in
March to represent Gonzalez on the advice of Sen. Patrick J. Leahy,
a Democrat who represents Craig's native state, Vermont. She said
it was clear that Gonzalez needed an American lawyer who could
navigate the perilous political and legal currents that enveloped
the case.
</P>
<P>
   She is also coordinating the private fund-raising to pay his
fees, which he has agreed to moderate from the firm's customary
$400 to $500 an hour. Campbell said she had already raised $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, 55, has served as advocate for a number of unpopular
clients and causes.
</P>
<P>
   He helped construct the successful insanity defense of John W.
Hinckley, the assailant who almost killed President Ronald Reagan
in 1981. He advised his former boss, Kennedy, in the Florida rape
case involving Kennedy's nephew William Kennedy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   He represented one of Haiti's wealthiest families, the Mevs, in
their efforts to persuade the Bush and Clinton administrations to
protect their sugar and oil interests in the political chaos
following the overthrow of Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's experience has been put to work in the tense
negotiations between the Justice Department and Elian's Florida
relatives, and as Gonzalez and other family members in Cuba prepare
to travel to the United States to be with Elian while the legal
process plays out.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Craig said he felt strongly that
Gonzalez should be peacefully and quickly reunited with his son; he
had harsh words for the Cuban-Americans in Miami threatening to try
to prevent the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he believed that Gonzalez, his new wife and his
children would be in danger in Miami because of the depth of
feeling the case has aroused and would be safer waiting in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are better off here in Washington than in South
Florida,'' he said. ``There is a quasi-insurgency underway down
there with emotions very, very high and people announcing their
willingness to sacrifice their lives. I take that at face value.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Craig said, sentiments are less passionate,
though no less treacherous. As for Vice President Al Gore, who last
week broke with the administration and sided with the Miami
relatives and those seeking political advantage by advocating their
position, Craig adopted a diplomatic silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in agreement with the position taken by the president and
the attorney general,'' he emphasized. ``Enough said.''

SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT DATES TO 1890  
(DW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sherman Antitrust Act, passed in 1890, outlaws all
contracts, combinations and conspiracies that unreasonably restrain
interstate trade. Common examples are price fixing and bid rigging.
</P>
<P>
   The act also makes it a crime to monopolize any part of
interstate commerce. An unlawful violation occurs when a company
dominates or attempts to dominate the market for a product or
service, but only if it has sought, achieved or maintained that
dominance by suppressing competition with anti-competitive conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Act violations can be prosecuted as felonies or
litigated in civil suits, as in the case the Justice Department and
19 states brought against Microsoft.

BRYANT SUSPENDED FOR A GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - Regrets? Sure, Kobe Bryant has a few after getting
fined and suspended for his Sunday-afternoon altercation with Chris
Childs of the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But reacting to Childs' head-butt and ``featherweight'' punches
by striking back is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you have to stand up for yourself,'' the Lakers'
dynamic playmaker said Monday. ``I don't think there's anything
wrong with that.I'm not pro-fighting by any means. But if it comes
to that point, you have to do what you gotta do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first fight of Bryant's pro career, and the NBA
responded with a $5,000 fine and a one-game suspension, which will
cost him another $109,756 in missed pay. He'll be home tonight when
the Lakers play the Suns in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA dealt Childs a two-game suspension and $15,000 fine for
starting the fight, which happened at the end of the third quarter
in the Lakers' 106-82 victory at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is sorry he'll miss a game when the Lakers are close to
clinching the best record in the NBA, sorry that backcourt-mate Ron
Harper won't get his planned rest on the injured list and sorry
that rookie guard John Celestand won't get a chance to play.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as anything -- since he's being punished anyway --
Bryant regrets not landing his return punch, which missed when
Childs backed up. Bryant was quickly restrained by officials and
was furious as he was escorted away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really like to fight that much, you know what I mean?
But if you do get to that point where you want to fight, (begin
ital)fight(end ital). Don't throw a punch and run. That was
frustrating,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant would rather have earned the suspension and fine by
actually connecting -- ``absolutely,'' he said. ``That's just human
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Already one of the NBA's brightest young stars, the 21-year-old
has also been one of its best citizens. He had just one technical
foul on his four-year resume until Sunday and couldn't recall ever
losing his temper in a game, even in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally try to keep a cool head,'' he said, ``but
sometimes things like that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs threw punches after Bryant elbowed him in the head while
running around a pick. Though Childs said Bryant gets away with
such moves often, Bryant said it was unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oops,'' said Bryant, who called the elbow ``just part of the
game. It pretty much happens every play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like an intentional thing, to hit him in the face,''
he said. ``It was more like, you make a cut going through when
somebody's holding, you want to get them off of you. The fact that
I hit him in the face was an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bryant's stature around the league has grown, so has the
clutching and grabbing from defenders, teammates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of respect. They have to respect his game,''
Harper said. ``They have to try to get to him and slow him down and
try to take him out of his basketball game. So you're going to see
guys holding, doing all those things now. So it's up to him to
maintain his head and go out and do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Childs just trying to disrupt Bryant's game? ``I don't think
so,''Bryant said. ``I don't think he's that smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates supported Bryant's retaliation, and Shaquille O'Neal
said the NBA shouldn't punish players for defending themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Commissioner) David Stern needs to change the rules,'' said
O'Neal, who was suspended in November for fighting Houston's
Charles Barkley. ``I don't know what you expect him to do when a
person takes two cheap shots to the face. ... They should (allow)
like a two-punch retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant will rejoin the team Wednesday in Oakland, and knows how
he'll spend his day off: ``Sleep. Relax. That's all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And while he accepts that his clean-cut image has acquired a
scuff or two (one teammate jokingly dubbed him ``Muhammed Kobe''),
Bryant acknowledged that players have to show they won't be pushed
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has really ever seen that side of me,
except for some of the players in closed practices,'' he said,
``but if somebody's going to push you, you've got to let them know
what the limit is.''
</P>
<P>
   The punishment, Bryant accepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's justified, because violence is not the way,'' he
said. ``We have to somewhat set an example for people who are
watching, for children who are watching, to kind of turn the other
cheek, as hard as it may be. And understand that if you don't do
that, there are going to be consequences.''

   Lakers (62-12) update: The Lakers are going for their 10th
straight win and another historic achievement - they can become the
third team in NBA history to have three double-digit winning
streaks in one season. The 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks and 1980-81
Philadelphia 76ers are the others.
</P>
<P>
   Suns (48-25) update: They've won nine of their last 11 games,
and showing no dropoff after Jason Kidd's injury, have won their
last three in a row. Kevin Johnson, 34, lured out of retirement,
played for the first time in two years Sunday and logged 18 minutes
in a win at Minnesota. Tonight will be his home debut.

JOHN ROBERT STARR, EDITOR   AND LONGTIME COLUMNIST, DIES AT 72 
</HEADLINE>
  (Attn: Colo., Ark., Ariz.)  
(DW) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Robert Starr, who as managing editor of a Little Rock,
Ark., newspaper led it to circulation victory over its once
overpowering rival _ partly through the force of his
365-days-a-year column _ died of a heart attack just outside Del
Norte, Colo., on Saturday. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's outsize and outspoken personality took on many
opponents, some of whom, like President Clinton, spoke kindly of
him after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was traveling from Arizona, where he had observed spring
training for the Colorado Rockies baseball team, to the Colorado
home of his son, John Phillip Starr.
</P>
<P>
   He retired as managing editor of The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
in 1992. The Democrat's battle with its rival was won in 1991, when
the Gazette was absorbed by the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was born in Lake Village, Ark., on Dec. 29, 1927. He was
named managing editor of the Arkansas Democrat in 1978 after 19
years as a reporter with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was famous for not sugarcoating opinions in his column. He
called the Gazette staff ``crybabies'' during his paper's struggle
for dominance.
</P>
<P>
   After alternating periods of admiration and dislike for Clinton,
as governor and president, Starr settled on consistent animosity.
The perception of his coverage of Clinton is suggested by the
widespread impression that he coined the nickname ``Slick Willie,''
when in fact it was Paul Greenberg, editor of the paper's editorial
page, who first used it.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he and his wife were saddened by Starr's
death. ``John Robert was as tenacious a friend as he was a foe,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is survived by Norma, his wife of 51 years. In addition to
his son John Phillip, he is also survived by another son, Robert
Russell, and a daughter, Linda Sharon Starr.

 &HT;    Griffey reception 'awesome'
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Dave Findlow traveled from Denver to attend Ken
Griffey Jr.'s debut as a Cincinnati Red on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He paid a broker $100 for an Opening Day ticket that the team
sells for $6.
</P>
<P>
   So when rain forced the umpires to suspend play with the
Milwaukee Brewers and Reds tied 3-3 in the fifth inning, Findlow
was not happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely mad,'' said Findlow, a Cincinnati native, who
played baseball against Griffey in high school. ``I flew 1,200
miles to see this game. And I have to go home tomorrow morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rain spoiled what was supposed to be one of the greatest Opening
Days in Reds' history. A record regular-season crowd of 55,596 _
including Ohio Gov. Bob Taft and U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine _ welcomed
Griffey home with a standing ovation. Reporters from 63 newspapers
and 36 television stations, including ESPN, which broadcast the
game, were on hand to record Griffey's every move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' Griffey said of the reception, ``something I
wasn't expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   But a steady downpour cut Junior's official homecoming short.
Umpires suspended play for good at 6 p.m., three hours after the
grounds crew pulled the tarp over the infield and the players
retreated to the clubhouse. It was the first time in Reds' history
Opening Day was a washout.
</P>
<P>
   Because the game ended in a tie, the Reds and Brewers will play
a complete game today beginning at 7:05 p.m. Fans with ticket stubs
from Monday's game will be admitted for free. No additional tickets
will be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Most fans left Cinergy Field by 4 p.m. Monday, weary of the rain
and convinced play would not resume. They had seen Griffey bat
twice, but he never reached base. He popped out in the first inning
and grounded out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't doing so hot,'' said Jacob Lindhurst, 12, of
Florence, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't seem to bother Lindhurst or anyone else at
Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were expecting too much of him,'' said Pat Courts, a
travel agent from Mason. ``Let him settle down.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey acknowledged he was nervous his first time up and
``swung at bad pitches.'' But he pointed out he has 162 more
regular-season games to go.
</P>
<P>
   With no game to watch and no Griffey home run balls to scramble
for, the several hundred fans who stuck around attempted to amuse
themselves. One young man ran onto the field and did two belly-flop
slides on the puddle-filled John Deere tarp before he was promptly
handcuffed and escorted away by police.
</P>
<P>
   Another attempted the same feat but managed little more than a
stumble and flop before police hauled him away. An hour or so
later, a third man dashed across right field and crawled through
the black tube that is used to roll up the tarp. He, too, was
cuffed and taken away.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of other fans sat in the green seats below the overhang
and shared personal stories about their connection with the famed
Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Ruberg, 10, of Alexandria, Ky., said his father, Dave,
used to baby-sit for Griffey Jr. and occasionally had a tough time
settling the superstar down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once (Ken) was being mean to his younger brother, Craig; he
kept tackling him, so my dad locked him in the garage,'' Curtis
said. (Curtis' uncle and Dave's older brother, Ken Ruberg,
confirmed the story, adding, ``Griffey Jr. was kind of a wild
one.'')
</P>
<P>
   Findlow of Denver recalled the time, as a senior at McNicholas
High School, he hit a shot into right center field against
Griffey's Moeller Crusaders. Griffey, of course, caught it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stole a double from me,'' Findlow said. ``That's my claim
to fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Findlow enjoys watching Griffey more in the
outfield than at the plate. The fact that Griffey didn't smack a
home run or even get a base hit Monday didn't bother Findlow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only one game,'' he said. ``The kid has so much pressure
on him. You just can't expect him to hit a home run (right away).
He's going to be beautiful, though.''

DUCKS'   KOHN TURNS TO VISOR
</HEADLINE>
 PREVIOUS VERSION-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Winger Ladislav Kohn isn't taking any more chances --
not after what happened to him Saturday and Sunday. Kohn barely
escaped a devastating injury against the Kings when he was hit
between the eyes by the side of Luc Robitaille's skate as the Los
Angeles star was falling down.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to get Kohn talking about learning to play with
a visor over the summer. But that process was speeded up Sunday
when he was hit in the left eye by deflected shot in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that is a sign that I better wear one,'' said Kohn, who
played with a visor on Monday versus Nashville. ``The skate was the
first warning, the puck the second, and I don't want a third
strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn, who played with a visor in juniors, compares playing with
a visor to wearing glasses, but he said ``it's worth it to save
your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohn's eye was almost completely shut within a half hour of the
accident and he spent the rest of the day icing it and draining the
blood that had accumlated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a very fun day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fredrik Olausson, one of the key members of the Anaheim power
play, was unable to play Monday due to the flu. Olausson, who has
15 goals and 33 points, was replaced by Jason Marshall, who had
been scratched the previous 12 games. Niclas Havelid took
Olausson's spot on the No. 1 power play unit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg insisted that Ducks were not
going to have one eye on the scoreboard Monday, looking for the
Edmonton-San Jose result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not during a game,'' he said of scoreboard watching. ``Our
entire focus has to be on ourselves. If we focus on anything else
it's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Ducks second line of Matt Cullen, Kip Miller and Ted
Donato, which had provided some much needed support for the team's
No. 1 line since Miller was picked up from Pittsburg on Jan. 29,
came into Monday's game having only one Cullen assist to show for
its efforts in the previous four games since the trio combined for
three goals and five points in Anaheim's 5-2 win over the Kings on
March 21. Cullen came into the Nashville game in the midst of a
14-game goal-scoring drought.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nothing comes easy for the Ducks. Heading into Monday's game,
Anaheim had outshot Phoenix and the Kings 57-25 in a stretch of 105
minutes, but the Ducks had to rally from two goals down to beat
Phoenix 4-3 in overtime and lost to the Kings 2-1 despite holding
them without a shot for nearly 24 1/2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks did set a new club record when they held the Kings
without a shot. Anaheim's previous low was two shots allowed.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Ducks signed Colgate University Center Andy McDonald to a
two-year contract. McDonald (5-10, 185) scored 25 goals and 58
points in 34 games in his senior season. He recently was named a
Hobey Baker Award finalist awarded to the top U.S. collegiate
player.

NO REST FOR HARPER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO -- Ron Harper knew instantly what Kobe Bryant's
Sunday-afternoon brawl meant: No rest for Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson was going to place Harper on the injured list
today, giving him five games to rest his creaky knees for the
playoffs. Rookie John Celestand was to take his place on the
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson didn't stick around long enough Monday to
confirm it,Harper said that plan has been scrapped, because Bryant
has been suspended for tonight's game at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm going to see it,'' Harper, 36, said. ``It's
too close to the end of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant will be back for Wednesday's game at Golden State, so in
theory, Harper could still get five games off and make it back for
the last two games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked (Jackson) about that too,'' Harper said. ``You know
what he told me? He shook his head and said come onto the floor. So
I'm pretty sure I won't be getting any time off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (Bryant) I'm mad at him. I told him I'm not his friend
anymore,'' Harper joked. ``I could use some time off, but since I'm
not going to get any time off, I've got to go out and just have fun
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will start either Derek Fisher or Brian Shaw
alongside Harper tonight. The Lakers are 3-0 against the Suns,
including a victory at Phoenix in November, when Bryant was out
with a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure other guys will step up,'' said Shaquille O'Neal.

   If his father had died at sea and Elian Gonzalez's mother were
waiting for him back in Cuba, we'd have fished the 6-year-old out
of the Atlantic and shipped him back to Havana before his pants
dried.
</P>
<P>
   That finally became clear over the weekend, when lawyers for
Elian's Florida relatives attacked the boy's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, claiming he may be an unfit parent.
</P>
<P>
   After more than four months, we now can stop pretending the case
of young Elian is an argument over the differences between Cuba and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about the virtues of freedom vs. the evils of
communism, or the oppression of Castro vs. the opportunities of
America.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   It begins and ends with the age-old belief that a child's mother
is more important to him than his father, even if the mother is
dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe (the father) Juan Miguel is completely under the
gun of the Castro regime,'' said an attorney for Elian's relatives.
``We think they are putting him up to psychological warfare and
tactics against his own son.''
</P>
<P>
   Warfare against his own son? For saying he loves him and wants
him back?
</P>
<P>
   That was over the weekend. Last week, this same lawyer said,
``We fear them (the Immigration and Naturalization Service)
revoking Elian's parole, tearing him from his family and returning
him to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   As if a boy's father is not his family. As if Elian would not be
returning to family, but only to Cuba. To the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine such things being said if we were discussing the
boy's mother?
</P>
<P>
   Would her affection be doubted as much? Would her motives be
questioned as harshly?
</P>
<P>
   Would Cuban activists in Miami be practicing resistance
techniques to keep a child from his mother? Would they be promising
to link arms outside the boy's Florida home to keep Elian from the
woman who gave birth to him?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not let Elian's civil rights be violated,'' said a
spokesman for the anti-Castro Democracy Movement in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Would the activists be so quick to cite civil rights and ignore
parental rights if Elian's mother were asking that he be returned
to her?
</P>
<P>
   And what about the American media? ABC aired an interview with
Elian without asking permission from the boy's father. An official
at the network said, ``What we put on the air was very tasteful,
very appropriate, very low-key, non-intrusive to Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked why Juan Miguel Gonzalez wasn't consulted
before his son was interviewed, an ABC spokesman said, ``It was a
supervised visit. We did have permission of his custodial guardian
and his attorney, which is what we thought was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Elian's mother have been so easily dismissed?
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, we assume she did what she thought was best for
herself and for her son when she boarded a rickety boat bound for
the United States last November.
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Elian's father, right or wrong, deserve the same
assumption in wanting his boy back?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cuban President Fidel Castro said that airing a
television interview with Elian without the father's permission was
``monstrous and sickening.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro said the same thing about the way Elian's case has been
handled and about the amount of time a boy has been kept from his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Americans should find even more monstrous, even
more sickening, is that the old dictator is right. &QL;

JUDGE'S DECISION CAME AFTER 4 MONTHS OF UNSUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT
TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to add 500 words, bgng `The Justice Department proposal tried
to address...')  
(With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the four months of settlement talks, Microsoft and the
Justice Department prepared 19 proposals and counterproposals
dealing with fine points of software in the technical parlance of
``source code'' and ``application program interfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives say they were finishing a reply to the
Justice Department's latest offer when the federal judge acting as
mediator halted the talks on Saturday. At that point, the two sides
had moved toward agreement on some elements but were still apart on
others, according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department proposal on the table, people familiar
with the discussions said, would have modified a range of
Microsoft's business activities, from its contract deals to sharing
information about its technology more openly with personal computer
makers and software makers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the proposal not only left Microsoft intact but, it seemed,
would not fundamentally alter the way the company does business.
Several of the 19 states joining in the suit protested to the
Justice Department and to the mediator, Judge Richard A. Posner,
that the proposal left Microsoft too many loopholes and lacked
sufficient enforcement mechanisms. And industry executives who were
read a summary said it was too weak to loosen Microsoft's grip on
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the states were overreacting and
that the industry executives were not shown all the provisions. But
one person close to the talks characterized the Justice Department
proposal as a ``65 percent solution'' and one that could be
``fairly criticized as not serious enough.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did Microsoft resist it? One key reason is apparently
that Microsoft viewed contract restrictions in the proposal as
limiting its freedom to add new technology freely to its
industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives did not discuss precise details of the
confidential settlement talks. But in interviews over the weekend,
Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, and William Neukom, the
company's general counsel, repeatedly alluded to that point.
</P>
<P>
   In the antitrust case, the government alleged _ and Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson agreed in his ruling Monday _ that Microsoft
illegally bundled its software for browsing the Internet to its
monopoly product, Windows, to stifle competition from Internet
software. Microsoft denied the charge, saying that it has the sole
discretion to determine what technology is included in its
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental issue in this case was whether we could
support Internet access in Windows,'' Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft points to a 1998 federal appeals court decision in
a related case that found that the company could bundle browsing
software into Windows as long as it could make some ``plausible''
claim of consumer benefit or business efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, Gates noted that ruling and applauded
its sentiment in detailing the stand of principle he insists that
Microsoft is making in continuing to fight the antitrust case in
court. ``We want to be free to put new things into Windows,'' he
said. ``The judiciary should never be involved in designing
software.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates pointed to speech-recognition software as the kind of new
technology that might reasonably be bundled into future generations
of Windows. At present, speech recognition software is an
application product, sold separately, made by companies including
Dragon Systems and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Before Microsoft bundled its browsing software into Windows, the
browser pioneer, Netscape Communications Corp., had a sizable
business in the browser market. But after Microsoft put browsing
into Windows and gave it away free, the separate market for
browsing software withered.
</P>
<P>
   Speech recognition software, say industry analysts and antitrust
experts, may be the next test for Microsoft's bundling strategy.
``The policy goal for the government in a settlement or through
court-ordered remedies is to try to insure that what happened to
Netscape will not happen in another major new product area,'' said
Mark Popofsky, a former Justice Department attorney who worked on
the Microsoft case, and who is now a partner at Kaye Scholer
Fierman Hays &AMP; Handler.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department proposal tried to address that issue in
two ways. First, it sought to encourage consumer choice by allowing
personal computer makers to choose what new features they wanted to
include in Windows by allowing them to take things, like the
browser, off or add new things, like a desktop ``shell'' tailored
for the PC maker's preferred software or Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   But if the PC maker made such changes, it would be responsible
for the costs of technical support of the modified version of
Windows. Microsoft has long maintained that its contracts with PC
makers insisted on a consistent ``look and feel'' to Windows, so as
not to drive up its own costs of giving technical help to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The second provision the Justice Department included in its
proposal to try to free PC makers to choose competing software was
to prohibit Microsoft from writing contracts that forced the
manufacturers to accept an additional Microsoft product as a
condition of receiving Windows, according to people close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Again, a key assertion in the antitrust case was that
Microsoft's Windows contracts with PC makers forced such bundling
of the Internet browser and Windows. In short, the Justice
Department proposal told Microsoft that it could add new technology
to Windows, but it could not force PC makers to accept it as a
condition of licensing Windows, which runs the basic operations of
nearly 90 percent of PCs sold today.
</P>
<P>
   Yet apparently, Microsoft regarded that restriction as too
severe. To the company, according to people close to the talks,
that provision in the Justice Department proposal amounted to
getting the government or courts involved in deciding what is and
what is not in a computer operating system. To the government, the
provision was a way of ensuring competition and consumer choice,
its goals in bringing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the government seeks to increase competition
through restraints on Microsoft's contracts and conduct _ as
opposed to breaking it up _ you are going to get yourself involved
in a line-drawing exercise about what's in the operating system,''
said Robert Litan, a former Justice Department official who is now
at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement talks were limited to so-called conduct remedies
because Microsoft refused to voluntarily discuss breakup proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, of course, is betting that on appeal it can whittle
down Jackson's ruling, so that the final outcome will not support a
breakup or even the kinds of restrictions the Justice Department
was proposing last week. ``We are long-term players in the legal
process,'' Neukom said. ``And we are confident in our legal
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet computer experts had advised Microsoft to settle. A month
ago, Microsoft asked Michael Cusumano, a professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management,
for his advice. ``I just told them to settle and agree to almost
any conduct remedies the government requested, because it wouldn't
change that much in the industry,'' he recalled.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ By dismantling a once-mighty but obliging
Tennessee team to capture the women's basketball national
championship, the Connecticut Huskies did everything they had done
so well during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, they did it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told these kids all year long that every pass we make in
practice, every cut, every rebound, pretend like it's the one
that's going to win the national championship,'' UConn coach Geno
Auriemma said after his team celebrated its 71-52 victory against
Tennessee in Sunday night's NCAA title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have practiced like this all year long, and the
night that they had to do it, they did it better than any other
time in the season,'' he said. ``And the fact that we did it
against a team as good as Tennessee makes this an accomplishment
all the more worthwhile because I know how hard it is to beat
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (36-1) made a shocking spectacle out of the
anticipated rubber match, capping a near-perfect season with a
flawless performance. They avenged their only loss of the season,
which came at home against Tennessee, by sticking to their
steamrolling mentality while adopting the Lady Vols' trademark
defense as their own.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening minutes, UConn executed the fast break like a
practice drill and spun the Lady Vols silly on backdoor cuts. And
with Tennessee's shooting guard, Kristen Clement, sidelined with a
severely sprained ankle, the Huskies took advantage of the
situation. They were able to trap the Lady Vols' young guards into
26 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut also frustrated Tamika Catchings, the nation's best
collegiate player, in limiting her to six shots. While the rest of
the Lady Vols missed easy baskets, Connecticut missed nothing, or
at least it seemed that way. The Huskies shot 50.8 percent from the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   And as they have done all season, the Huskies overwhelmed their
opponent with a deep arsenal of talent from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Such an imbalance made for bad theater, but that might have been
the only failing on a night when the Huskies could do no wrong.
They started the season at No. 1 and ended it in the same lofty
place.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and Tennessee (33-4) split the home-and-home series
in the regular season, with Tennessee taking the most recent game
in Storrs, Conn., when the Huskies relinquished a 14-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   They were not giving away anything Sunday night; Shea Ralph
would not let them. Connecticut's redshirt junior willed her team
to the title, flashing an ``out of my way'' glare. Ralph was
determined to make those excruciating six-hour sessions of
rehabilitating her knees mean something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked so hard over these past two or three years and I
haven't wanted anything as badly as I wanted it tonight,'' Ralph
said after leading the Huskies with 15 points, six steals and seven
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph's all-American teammate, Svetlana Abrosimova, contributed
14 points, while the 6-foot-5-inch center Kelly Schumacher had nine
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   All three players are juniors. Point guard Sue Bird, the magical
ingredient in UConn's chemistry this season, is a sophomore. So are
the post players Swin Cash, Asjha Jones and Tamika Williams. The
senior forwards Stacy Hansmeyer and Paige Sauer will graduate this
year, but the Huskies will hardly notice. What is more, UConn will
bring in four of the nation's top freshmen next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think next year it's going to be even better because we know
that we won a national championship, so we just have to repeat
that,'' Abrosimova said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut won its first title since the 1995 team went 35-0
and also beat Tennessee for the crown. That year the Huskies used
seven players; this year, they went with 10 and they will only get
deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee returns all of its starters as well, including
Catchings and Clement. Without Clement, who averaged 5.6 points a
game, the Lady Vols lacked experience and emotion in the title game
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would that have changed the outcome of this game?'' Tennessee
coach Pat Summitt said. ``I can't say that that would have
happened. She's been our best defender on the perimeter. When we
started I thought it really affected our press offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, Summitt bore a resigned look on the
sideline. Her team was self-destructing, much as it did in a
blowout loss to Georgia earlier this season, and she could not stop
it.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings did not score the first of her 16 points until there
were four minutes left in the first half. By then the game was
already over. Semeka Randall hit only one of her 11 shots. No one
played defense.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Summitt, upset with her team's embarrassing
performance, privately apologized to people who had followed the
team all season long.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game doesn't mean your program is falling apart or that
you can't be competitive at this level,'' she said. ``We are not
going away. I'm certainly not on my way out and we'll be back here,
hopefully, again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee and Connecticut will renew their rivalry _ UConn leads
it by 6-5 _ with another home-and-home series next season.
</P>
<P>
   The championship was hyped as a potential groundbreaking event,
pitting the top two teams in the country. But the final had no
cosmic significance. It was simply a game won by a team far better
than any other right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the people at ESPN would have much preferred a
double-overtime game won on a 3-pointer at the buzzer, and I
apologize for that,'' Auriemma said, half-seriously. ``The game
itself does need more great rivalries. Connecticut-Tennessee is
one. It needs more.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the second-best team in the nation cannot contest
Connecticut, then perhaps parity in the women's game will take
longer to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the beginning of anything and this isn't the end of
anything,'' Auriemma said. ``I'd like to look at this as the
continuation of the growth of the game.''

DUVAL SAYS HE'S FIT FOR A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Outsiders examine David Duval's new look _
chiseled upper body, tapered waist, collarless shirts _ and see a
player in transition, grasping at another straw in an effort to
close the gap on Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   They peruse Duval's playing record, which shows a full calendar
year between PGA Tour victories, and sense a slump for the No. 2
player in the world golf rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Both observations are based on fact. But Duval said the
conclusions are faulty.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares for Thursday's opening round of the Masters
Tournament, Duval said he feels just as confident about winning as
he did a year ago. Maybe more so, Duval added, because he is not
worn down from off-course scrutiny that seemed to short-circuit his
game shortly after surpassing Woods _ for a brief stretch in 1999 _
as the game's top-ranked player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have some very big things ahead of me the next few
weeks,'' Duval said. ``I don't know how you quantify it. But
physically and mentally, I am right there. I feel very good about
myself and my golf. I just need a good break here or there. Maybe
that one last putt falling for me that really turns it around.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, 28, had all the momentum on his side heading into the
1999 Masters. He had won two consecutive tournaments and captured
11 titles in 34 starts before finishing a distant sixth at Augusta.
A year later, Duval is riding an 0-for-22 stretch into Masters
week. In some ways, he surmised, that might be more blessing than
curse.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after finishing five strokes behind winner Jose Maria
Olazabal at the 1999 Masters, Duval began withdrawing from events _
including the MasterCard Colonial _ because he felt ``burned out.''
Contrast that to last month, when he was a surprise, last-minute
entry in the 2000 Doral-Ryder Open despite making a cross-country
flight during tournament week. Duval said a rigorous conditioning
program, coupled with a fat-free diet and a self-imposed ban on
chewing tobacco, has given him a fresh outlook and greater energy
in his ongoing Tiger chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see how fit I could get,'' said Duval (6-foot, 180
pounds), whose body fat-ratio has dropped into single digits since
November. ``I figured it would help my golf to get stronger, but
this is about so much more than golf. It's about self-discipline. I
told myself, `If I can do something like this, I can do a lot of
other things.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He might not have a victory this season, but Duval ranks seventh
on the money list ($1,006,205). He is tied for second with Woods
among tour players in greens in regulation (73.8 percent) and is
third behind Woods and Hal Sutton on the charts in ball-striking, a
new statistic that blends distance and accuracy variables. The
biggest thing keeping Duval out of the winner's circle has been a
balky putter. He ranks tied for 56th among peers in putting (1.765
average per green in regulation), as opposed to first at this
juncture last season (1.677).
</P>
<P>
   But the putting, he said, has rounded into shape in recent weeks
and all systems point toward liftoff at Augusta. Despite the
victory drought, Woods said Duval is ``far from slumping ... He's
just not getting any breaks to fall his way right now. We all go
through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval said he has made peace with negative feedback he received
from fans and U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw for adopting a pay-for-play
stance before the 1999 Ryder Cup. Eventually, a compromise was
reached and PGA of America officials, organizers of the Ryder Cup,
agreed to donate $200,000 to charities of each participant's
choosing.
</P>
<P>
   In part to repair his image from the Ryder Cup flap, Duval made
a series of humorous commercials for AT&AMP;T and Charles Schwab that
play off his dry wit. He counseled with a media consultant. He
changed his look. But inside, Duval said he's still the same guy
who believes honesty is the only policy when dealing with other
people. Given another opportunity to tackle the pay-for-play issue
in advance of the Ryder Cup, Duval said, he wouldn't change
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you ask my opinion, I give it to you. I am not going to
tell you something I don't think,'' Duval said. ``I don't have a
problem with people who differ with my opinion. That is what life
is all about, learning from people with varying points of view ...
To be lambasted for having a different opinion than the majority, I
find that kind of strange. That has hurt me, but I don't hold
grudges.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed he had won back the majority of golf fans,
Duval shrugged and made a sweeping motion with his hand toward
reporters in the interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that everybody in this room probably likes me.
But you're not ever going to get in a room where everybody likes
you, unless it's at your own birthday party,'' Duval said. ``I
think all my relationships, with the fans included, are going to
continue to change and grow and evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true with his chest measurement, waistline and
clothing choices. The benefits of his new physique, Duval conceded,
might be lost on outsiders who focus only on the fact that Woods
has won 10 times at PGA Tour events since the 1999 Masters, while
he has remained winless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much of a rivalry right now, is there?,'' Duval
said, laughing. ``There's no question in anyone's mind that Tiger
is the best player in the world right now. But it's not like he's
on another, unreachable level. I'm not that far behind him. And, in
golf, things have a way of changing in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 2000 season, change has been par for the course for
David Duval. During Masters week, he'd like to change his status as
the top-ranked player in world golf rankings without a major
championship.

NEW, OLD MAKES FOR POTENT RANGERS OPENER

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Can I change my MVP vote now?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, c'mon, I really meant to say that Pudge Rodriguez would
repeat as American League MVP. That Manny Ramirez thing, that must
have been a typo.
</P>
<P>
   OK, if not Pudge, how about putting me down for Gabe ``The
Babe'' Kapler? You'll at least let me get away with that much,
won't you?
</P>
<P>
   And Cy Young? Somehow Kenny Rogers didn't strike out a single
batter Monday and still managed to look unbeatable. Forget about
Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens. ``The Gambler's'' back and he's
bad.
</P>
<P>
   It was Opening Day at The Ballpark in Arlington on Monday, which
is kind of like Christmas and New Year's Eve and Halloween all
rolled into one, and the Texas Rangers gleefully took the wraps off
a team that had six new faces in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   There was something old (Rogers), something new (Kapler) and
something blue (Rodriguez) for the White Sox as the Rangers treated
a record-shattering crowd of 49,322 to a rousing 10-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler and Rodriguez each homered twice and Rogers had the
frustrated White Sox pounding the ball into the ground for eight
solid innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was everything I wanted and more,'' said Rogers, back in
a Rangers uniform for the first time since leaving as a free agent
after the 1995 season. ``This was everything we needed as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense was explosive and just kept pouring it on, too.
That's a sign of a good offense. We got up 4-1 or whatever but the
guys didn't let up. They kept swinging the bats good and driving in
runs. As a pitcher, you love that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers did his part with a sinker that had more bite than a
rattlesnake. He notched 17 groundball outs as a strong infield
defense, led by shortstop Royce Clayton and third baseman Tom
Evans, turned four double plays behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Kenny was in command,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``When he needed the double play he got it.''
</P>
<P>
   And when he needed runs, he got those, too, thanks mostly to
Kapler and Rodriguez, who took turns battering White Sox starter
Mike Sirotka.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler introduced himself to Rangers' fans with a solo home run
in the second. Rodriguez snapped a 1-1 tie in the third with a
three-run homer off the left-field foul pole on a pitch that broke
Sirotka's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was thigh-high cut fastball,'' Sirotka said, shaking his
head. ``I make my living with that pitch against righties, and not
many can do what he did with that pitch, hit it hard and keep it
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler drilled a second homer to left in the fourth and
Rodriguez belted another, a two-run shot, in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   If this was Rodriguez's opening salvo in defense of his American
League MVP crown, it was an auspicious beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just seems to add something to his game every year,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always telling myself every year, I want to do better
numbers,'' said Rodriguez, whose .332 average, 35 homers and 113
runs batted in earned him his first MVP award in 1999. ``That's the
attitude I have this year again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who thought Rodriguez had simply had a career year last
year might have to think again. The best, hitting coach Rudy
Jaramillo predicted, is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's had his best season yet,'' Jaramillo said.
``He's got such great hand-eye coordination, plus he's so strong in
his hands, wrists and forearms and he's got great legs. His
conditioning has taken him to where he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has the type of year he had last year, it's great, but
he and I are shooting for a better year. He wants to hit 40 home
runs without going out there trying to hit 40 home runs. He's going
to hit over .300 and we want his RBI production to go up, his runs
scored to go up. He still has potential for his whole game to go up
and that's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is, but Rodriguez was among those in the Rangers'
clubhouse lining up to say that Monday's victory wasn't about
individual accomplishments. It was a team thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with (what he did in Monday's) game,''
Rodriguez said, ``but it's more important that we go home with a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, that theme echoed from the interview room to the
Rangers' clubhouse. From Rodriguez, to Kapler, to Rogers to Oates.
What we're seeing is a team coming together just as the starting
gun fires. The timing couldn't be more perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it all spring, don't sell these guys short, they may
be a little better than what a lot of people are expecting,'' Oates
said. ``It was fun watching them get after it today. We're going to
be a fun team to watch and that's not just one win talking. I've
been saying that all spring.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about it: The fun has just begun; 161 more to go.

   NEW YORK _ It wasn't just Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index endured one of its worst days ever
Monday, as technology stocks broadly sold off. The decline, of 7.6
percent, was the worst daily performance for the index since the
summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which is just one of the 4,827 stocks in the Nasdaq
composite but makes up 8.5 percent of the value of the index, was
responsible for only about one-sixth of the record 349.15-point
decline. Its shares fell $15.375, to $90.875 _ shaving $80 billion
off the company's market value _ as investors waited for the ruling
that the company had violated antitrust laws, a ruling made after
the end of regular trading.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nasdaq wipeout was far broader than Microsoft. Of the
100 stocks in the Nasdaq 100 _ generally the largest companies in
the Nasdaq composite index _86 fell in value. They included some of
the highest fliers heretofore, like Cisco Systems, which for a time
last month was the most valuable company in the country, and
Qualcomm, the mobile phone technology company that is now down
nearly 30 percent from the peak it reached in the first trading day
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it was the fifth-worst day ever for the index, measured
by percentages, trailing just the 8.6 percent fall of Aug. 31,
1998, and three days during the 1987 stock market crash. The 1998
fall came amid worry that the world's financial system was
crumbling, and the 1987 falls came as the entire American stock
market seemed to be collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Monday's move came on a day when many stocks were
doing quite well, thank you. The Dow Jones industrial average
leaped 2.7 percent Monday _ and would have been up 3.7 percent had
it not been weighed down by the changes Dow Jones made last
November, when it added Microsoft and Intel to the list.
</P>
<P>
   Just what the Nasdaq plunge means _ or whether it means much of
anything at all _ is not easy to analyze because volatility in the
Nasdaq market has been running at record levels this year, and big
falls have often been followed by equally large rebounds. The
Nasdaq composite is down 16.3 percent from the peak it reached
March 10. But it is still up 3.8 percent since the end of last
year. The Dow, by contrast, is up 13 percent since March 10, but is
down 2.4 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of opposite movement for the Dow and the Nasdaq is far
from common. The Nasdaq index, which dates back to 1971, has seen
41 daily declines of at least 3 percent prior to this year. The Dow
had declined on 40 of those days, the only exception being on Oct.
20, 1987, the day after the worst day of the 1987 crash. That
exception reflected not so much investor sentiment about the
relative weakness of the Nasdaq issues but a quirk of the previous
day. The decline in Nasdaq the day before had been smaller than the
Dow's because many of the brokers that made Nasdaq markets chose
not to answer their phones, and thus kept reported prices
artificially high.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Nasdaq has gyrated wildly this year, the Dow has
often moved to a different drummer. Of the 11 days in 2000 on which
the Nasdaq has fallen at least 3 percent, four of them have seen
the Dow go up.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, it appears that the new-economy stocks that
zoomed last year and early this year are falling. Meanwhile, the
old-economy stocks that did not rise much if at all last year and
early in 2000 are gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that when panic struck equity investors they
bailed out of stocks in general, putting money into cash. But these
days it appears that they are more likely to buy other stocks
instead. The belief in technology stocks is being challenged, but
not the faith overall in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric, which rose $5.375 to $161 Monday, is again the
most valuable company in the land, with a market value of $530.5
billion, compared with $527 billion for Cisco and $473 billion for
Microsoft, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets. A week ago, GE
was in third place.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is among the most widely held stocks in the country,
both in individual portfolios and in mutual funds. But the extent
to which holders were hurt Monday depended largely on what else was
held. Diversified funds with many large stocks were not badly
damaged, while funds concentrated in technology stocks were. The
Fidelity Magellan Fund, for which Microsoft was the largest holding
at last report, was off just 0.3 percent Monday, in part because
General Electric was the fund's second-largest holding. But the
Fidelity OTC Portfolio and the Fidelity Select Technology Fund, for
which Microsoft was also the largest holding, fell 7.8 and 9.2
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The easy-come, easy-go nature of this market is illustrated by
the PBHG Technology and Communications Fund, which fell 13.6
percent Monday. At its peak on March 9, the fund was up 71.5
percent from the end of 1999. Now its gain for the year has been
cut to 7.9 percent.

RANGERS' ROGERS DELIGHTS IN MORE HOME COOKING
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Kenny Rogers was 19-6 with a 3.34 earned-run
average at The Ballpark in Arlington before this year, including a
perfect game in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   So it's only natural that, after a four-year hiatus, he was
happy to don a Texas Rangers home uniform again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be back here,'' Rogers said. ``I was comfortable
in this park before, and knew I would be again.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Rogers is comfortable in just about any park he calls
home.
</P>
<P>
   By holding the Chicago White Sox to one run on six hits in eight
innings of the Rangers' 10-4 Opening Day victory Monday, he won his
19th consecutive game in his home park, tying him with Frank Viola
for the third-longest home winning streak in major-league history,
one behind Lefty Grove and four behind Ray Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're comfortable at home, that makes a difference,''
Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   The streak started on Sept. 7, 1997, four seasons and three
teams ago, when he pitched for the New York Yankees and defeated
Baltimore. He was traded to the Oakland Athletics in the
off-season, and won all 11 decisions at Network Associates Coliseum
over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Oakland the first year, it wasn't a coincidence,'' he
said. ``I pitched well just about every time out, and could have
won more games.''
</P>
<P>
   It continued last season, when he won four home starts for the
A's and then, after an August trade to the New York Mets, earned
victories in his two decisions at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a little bit of a fluke,'' Rogers said. ``I had
a couple of games I should have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad outings came in no-decisions. In the 19 victories, his
ERA is 1.56. He hasn't always dominated in the streak; he has only
struck out more than five batters four times. But he has been
efficient, just as he was against the White Sox on Monday when he
got four double-play grounders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made some pitches on the corner, kept the breaking balls
and changeups down, moved the fastball in and out,'' Rangers
catcher Ivan Rodriguez said. ``He kept the ball down, and made them
hit it on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the streak continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's there, but I don't focus on that at all,'' Rogers
said. ``I know some day that streak will come to an end, but
hopefully not for a long time.'' nn

LACK OF PATIENCE COSTS WHITE SOX

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The message written in black Sharpie and
pinned to the bulletin board in the visitors' clubhouse went
largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The pregame schedule for the Chicago White Sox offered sound
advice for opposing Texas Rangers left-hander Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be patient,'' it read. ``He doesn't like to get deep in
count.''
</P>
<P>
   So, what happened on Opening Day?
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox took ``some very young swings'' in the estimation
of manager Jerry Manuel, and Rogers required only 88 pitches to
complete eight innings during the Rangers' 10-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers failed to throw a first-pitch strike to 11 of the first
14 batters, and the White Sox squandered multiple hitters' counts.
Only four of the first 14 batters reached safely, and Rogers erased
three from the basepaths by inducing double-play ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox's failures during their first three at-bats
established a pattern for the remainder of the afternoon. The
swings by second baseman Ray Durham and shortstop Jose Valentin on
2-1 pitches resulted in ground-ball outs, and first baseman Frank
Thomas also grounded out on a 3-0 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a fastball away there,'' Thomas said. ``He
sunk one down and in on me, and I had already committed. That's a
veteran for you. He doesn't get bothered on 3-and-0 and 3-1.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox designated hitter Paul Konerko grounded into a
second-inning double play on a 1-0 pitch after right fielder
Magglio Ordonez reached on a five-pitch walk. Durham hit a weak fly
ball to left field on a 3-2 pitch during his third-inning at-bat
after working the count to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we helped him out wouldn't be giving him the credit he
deserves,'' said Konerko, who also hit a routine fly ball on a 2-0
pitch during his fifth-inning at-bat. ``I think we were a little
overanxious all day, but he made some good pitches, too. He's a
smart pitcher, and I think he took advantage of us being
overanxious on Opening Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 27 of Rogers' 54 pitches were strikes through four innings,
but the White Sox produced only one run _ and it scored on a
double-play ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Rogers pitched a good game,'' Thomas said. ``He really
changed speeds well, worked in and out and kept us off balance. It
was the seventh inning before we knew it.'' nn

ZEBRA MUSSELS STAR IN HUDSON'S ECOLOGICAL MELODRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite 8th graf.)  
(The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silently, mostly out of sight and unknown to all but a handful
of the millions of people who live along the Hudson River, a subtle
but elegant ecological drama is under way that may determine
whether the revivified, revitalized river can continue its hard-won
recovery from decades of pollution and degradation.
</P>
<P>
   The central player in the drama is the zebra mussel, a
coin-size, hard-shelled, black-and-white-striped mollusk from
Eurasia that hitchhiked to the Great Lakes aboard oceangoing ships
in the late 1980s and has since been on the march in waters of the
northeastern United States. The mussels first appeared in the
Hudson a decade ago; their fluctuating population there is
estimated at 500 billion to 600 billion in peak years.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, attention has focused on the mussel's ability to
disrupt water supplies by clogging intake pipes. But its ecological
impact is perhaps more spectacular; it has simply transformed the
chemistry of the freshwater portion of the Hudson, roughly above
West Point, and threatened the stability of that entire stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for some time, for instance, that the
heaviest concentrations of mussels filter all the water in their
part of the river through their bodies every three days, as
compared, in their absence, with every 50 days for all other
aquatic organisms combined. In doing so, the mussels strain out and
consume microscopic plants, called phytoplankton, that are the
basis of the aquatic food chain.
</P>
<P>
   One result has been that numbers of tiny aquatic animals that
feed on the phytoplankton were cut about in half, sharply reducing
food supplies for creatures higher on the chain. Another is that
freshwater clams, which also consume phytoplankton, declined
drastically.
</P>
<P>
   Now experts have discovered another serious threat posed by the
mussels. They suck up so much oxygen from the water that in summer,
much of the ecosystem is approaching a danger point at which other
aquatic creatures begin to flee or die, according to a new study by
a team of ecologists at the Institute for Ecosystem Studies in
Millbrook, N.Y., who have been studying the Hudson ecosystem since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   The report of the discovery, by Dr. Nina F. Caraco and six
colleagues at the institute, appears in the April 1 issue of
Environmental Science and Technology, a publication of the American
Chemical Society. Their study was based on detailed measurements of
dissolved oxygen in the river and an analysis of differences in
oxygen concentrations before and after the mussels appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygenless dead spots once plagued the river as a result of an
influx of raw sewage; bacteria consumed great quantities of oxygen
as they decomposed the sewage and other organic material. Experts
thought that the problem of low oxygen had been eliminated over the
last three decades at the cost of several billion dollars' worth of
sewage treatment systems. The new discovery mocks that achievement.
</P>
<P>
   For the bacteria to match the mussels' depletion of oxygen,
Caraco said, ``you would have to increase present sewage in the
river threefold.'' The oxygen loss caused by the mussels would be
twice as bad as it is except for another aspect of their impact,
she said, and it is here that the ecological plot thickens.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, Caraco said, that the mussels also remove from the
river many small particles that cloud the water and reduce the
penetration of sunlight. With more sunlight flooding the clearer
water, slender, underwater native plants called water celery have
flourished. The plants give off oxygen as they convert sunlight to
energy through photosynthesis, and this extra oxygen has partly
offset the loss of it to mussels.
</P>
<P>
   But another actor now enters, altering the equation yet again.
It is a second exotic invader called the water chestnut, a floating
plant that produces spiny seed pods that can pierce a rubber sole
and grows so densely that some boats cannot go through it.
</P>
<P>
   Like all aquatic plants, Caraco said, the fast-spreading
chestnuts draw oxygen from the river as part of their metabolism;
but unlike the water celery, none of the oxygen they give off in
photosynthesis returns to the water; instead, it is vented to the
air. The result is that the water in many chestnut beds has no
oxygen at all in the summer _ when higher temperatures accelerate
organisms' activity _ and tidal mixing distributes some of this
water to other parts of the river.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Hudson has had a startling recovery since the
days in the 1960s when it was a foul stream polluted by the raw
sewage of cities and towns up and down its length. Some parts were
literally dead in the summer from lack of oxygen. Today, as a
result of deliberate cleanup efforts, industrial decline and the
recapture of onetime farmland by resurgent forests that reduce the
runoff of sediments, the river bursts with life. More than 200
species of fish live in or visit it, and the water is clean enough
in many places to swim in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its resurgent vitality, though, the Hudson is in many
ways no longer natural but rather a human artifact. People control
and alter its shape, the flow of nutrients that sustain it, the
character of its habitats _ and the mixture of species that live in
it. At least scores and probably hundreds of species from other
lands and other parts of the continent inhabit the river and its
immediate environs. About 10 percent of these, according to earlier
research, have had an ecological impact, most of it negative.
</P>
<P>
   The zebra mussels are Exhibit A. At peak densities, they
outweigh all other organisms in their territory combined. The
territory stretches from the dam at Troy to the fringes of the New
York metropolitan area, where the water becomes too salty for them.
</P>
<P>
   They are especially concentrated in the upper stretches, where
the rocky bottom is to their liking and they cluster in densities
estimated at 10,000 to 20,000 individuals per square meter (about
10 square feet). Even in the lower, softer-bottomed stretches, they
may account for a third to a half of all organisms by weight, said
Dr. David L. Strayer of the Millbrook institute, one of Caraco's
co-authors.
</P>
<P>
   In a stroke of bad ecological luck, Strayer said, the highest
concentrations of mussels happen to be where the Hudson's
phytoplankton production is also concentrated. ``That's one of the
reasons the ecological impacts are so severe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems likely that the mussels' drain on oxygen will
probably not get much worse than it already is, he said, the spread
of the water chestnut could combine with the mussels' oxygen use to
worsen it. Even if this never gets to the point where extensive
fish kills result, he said, it could well place a cap on further
efforts to enhance the river's health.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said, areas dominated by the water chestnut are
already devoid of summertime oxygen, and this limits habitat for
native species, hobbling habitat restoration efforts and shrinking
rather than expanding the ranges of many aquatic creatures.
Expansion of the water chestnut could shrink the available habitat
even more.
</P>
<P>
   It is, Strayer said, as if the mussels and the chestnut are
limiting opportunities for further improvement of the Hudson.

AT COLUMBIA, QUESTIONS LINGER OVER A RADIOACTIVE STAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mystery writer might call it ``The Pillow Case.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months after officials from Columbia University began
investigating a stain of radioactive material that a graduate
biology student said she found on her pink pillow, questions
persist about how and why the contamination occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The university says that evidence shows the student, Yao Cheng,
intentionally tainted her pillow with the material, phosphorus-32,
as part of a convoluted plan to shift from graduate studies in
biology to the business school. Cheng was expelled last month. The
city Health Department concurred with the technical findings,
although it did not venture a motive.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng says she is innocent and has complained about the
university's disciplinary procedures that led to her expulsion. She
has appealed her expulsion, but if that fails _ a ruling is
expected in the next few days _ she may lose her student visa and
be forced to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   No one was harmed, but city health officials said it was the
first time they could recall that radioactive material left a
restricted laboratory in the city and, potentially, exposed the
public to contamination. Given the small amount of phosphorus-32
involved _ a few drops _ only someone who slept on the bed
repeatedly would have been at risk, radiation experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Cheng took a Geiger counter home to her apartment
and, she has said, found the material on the pillow. Cheng and her
husband told university officials they had no idea how the stain
had gotten there.
</P>
<P>
   An intensive investigation began and the university's radiation
safety officers quickly concluded that the stain was too
concentrated to have been an accidental smear. They said that it
had to have been put on the pillow intentionally, and that there
was no suspect other than Cheng.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Lei Liu, a doctoral candidate in computer science,
was also investigated, but he was exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Both students are from China and met while studying at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng and her husband said that she had no opportunity, under
the university's disciplinary system, to challenge the
investigators' assertions, offer evidence or be present to question
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week in the couple's apartment, Liu said he
and his wife were shocked at how the hearings had been handled.
``In this country, we thought you have a chance to see witnesses,
to ask questions,'' Liu said. ``That may be true in court, but not
at this school.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, several dozen Columbia students, mostly from China,
demonstrated outside the school's administrative offices in the Low
Memorial Library, saying that the case has been handled unfairly
and that Cheng was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia officials declined Monday to comment on the case,
saying only that the appeal was still being considered.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal officials who track radiation incidents,
the case is one of only a handful in recent years in which
phosphorus-32 has left a licensed laboratory and potentially
exposed someone to radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the incident, Columbia has installed locks on the
refrigerators and freezers in which phosphorus-32 and other
radioactive research materials are stored. Until this year, the
university, like most other institutions using isotopes, had
required licensed personnel to monitor the use of the substances,
but had not tightly restricted access to them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The report filed by the investigative committee asserts that
interviews conducted with Cheng indicated that she was unhappy in
the biology program. It speculated that she might have thought that
if she became contaminated with radioactivity, she would not be
able to do further work in the science labs, because federal
regulations set an annual limit for allowable exposure.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, according to the report, Cheng suggested that
it might be necessary to transfer to a different degree program.
</P>
<P>
   George Hamawy, the university's radiation safety officer, wrote
in the report: ``I asked her what would she do if we find out that
she received a large exposure dose. Her answer came fast, that she
would change her major. I inquired further about that. She revealed
that if we find out that she received a large dose, she would not
stay in the Biology Department, with a potential of further
exposure, but she would change her major to a school such as the
Business School.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges were filed, even though the removal of the
dangerous substance from the laboratory violated state licensing
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Levy, a lawyer who is representing the couple, said
the university's case against Cheng was largely circumstantial. He
said Cheng's predicament was made more difficult by the
university's disciplinary rules, under which a student can base an
appeal only on the mishandling of an investigation _ not on the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that dean's office at Columbia is giving this an
objective look,'' he said Monday.

JUDGE RULES MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTITRUST LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN,  
 DAN RICHMAN and KATHY MULADY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The decision in round two, like round one of what
could be a very long and bruising Microsoft Corp. antitrust bout,
on Monday went to the federal and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of almost no one, U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft violated the Sherman
Antitrust Act as well as the laws of 19 states that also sued the
Redmond, Wash., software maker.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the ruling at the end of trading Monday, investors
hammered Microsoft's stock all day long, slicing $80 billion off
the market value of the company. The stock fell $15.38, to close at
$90.88. Trading more than 132 million shares, the battering helped
drag the Nasdaq composite index to its biggest point loss ever; the
7.6 percent plunge was the fifth-worst one-day drop.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's losses also trimmed about $35 billion from the hands of
people in the Seattle area, where roughly 40 percent of the
company's stock is held. Even so, reaction ranged from concern that
one of the nation's most successful companies was being reined in,
to hope that a vicious predator's hurtful business practices would
be curbed.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happens is to be determined in a ruling _ now
expected sometime this summer _ on remedies and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, still protesting the strength of its legal case, on
Monday promised to appeal the ruling, stressing a 1998 U.S. Court
of Appeals decision that affirmed its right to support the Internet
in its Windows operating system. The appeal, though, would have to
come after any ruling on remedies by Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   William Neukom, Microsoft's executive vice president for law and
corporate affairs, said Microsoft expects an expedited review of
its appeal could produce a decision within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom said the ``broad-based'' appeal will contest the
procedure of the case as well as the application of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the middle innings of this lawsuit,'' Neukom said.
``We like our prospects very much in the later innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the game may not be over, the decision immediately
subjects the software maker to increased exposure from private
lawsuits which can base their arguments of harm to consumers and
competitors on Jackson's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had been expected to rule against the company since his
findings last November concluded, after an 11-month trial, that
Microsoft was a monopoly and had harmed consumers. His description
of the company Monday was harsh.
</P>
<P>
   He said Microsoft placed ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of
competitive fortune. ... Microsoft's anticompetitive actions
trammeled the competitive process through which the computer
software industry generally stimulates innovation and conduces to
the optimum benefit of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a conclusion of law. The next step is to decide
what penalties and remedies he might assess against Microsoft.
Those could include at least seven options from radically
restructuring or breaking up the company to assessing fines and
placing limitations on Microsoft's business practices and the
products it sells.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came after four months of settlement talks, from
which emerged 19 proposals and counterproposals. By Saturday,
though, agreement had been reached on some points, but not others,
when the talks were halted.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling quickly followed, as he had threatened
throughout the talks. Microsoft had violated the 110-year-old
federal antitrust law, which prohibits efforts to restrain trade or
attempting to monopolize markets, as well as state antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys general who have pushed the case hailed the ruling
as a victory for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we've been vindicated,'' said Iowa Attorney General
Tom Miller. ``Consumers were harmed in terms of choice, innovations
they would have had and perhaps in price.''
</P>
<P>
   The states declined to get into specifics about what they will
recommend to Jackson. Miller said a settlement is still a
possibility, although he added that any agreement ``has to be
substantial and it has to address competition.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Microsoft officials said the company still is open
to a settlement, but they have steadfastly opposed any effort to
split up the company.
</P>
<P>
   That's the only solution, according to Ralph Nader, a prominent
critic of Microsoft, who said Monday that leaving Microsoft intact
would require ``an army of law enforcement officials to monitor
this global economy.'' His sentiments were echoed by some in the
software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Barksdale, former chief executive of archrival Netscape
Communications Corp., said the ``most effective way to restore
competition is through a structural remedy or a breakup of
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said the breadth and
thoughtfulness of Jackson's research ``puts Microsoft in a bind''
and leaves little room for success on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling ``definitely keeps a shadow on the stock,'' he
said. ``I don't think it keeps the stock from performing. It just
slows it down.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Jackson said that Microsoft broke the law by
unlawfully tying its browser, Internet Explorer, to its Windows
operating system by maintaining its monopoly position in operating
systems through anticompetitive means, and attempting to monopolize
the Web browser market.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did decline to find Microsoft in violation of antitrust
laws on a third issue: exclusive arrangements with computer makers
calling for placement of Internet Explorer and shutting out
Netscape Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled that Microsoft went out of its way to discourage
computer manufacturers from including Netscape Navigator on their
machines and to keep Internet access providers from generating
browser usage for its rival's browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft was truly inspired by a genuine concern for
maximizing consumer satisfaction, as well as preserving its
substantial investment in a worthy product, then it would have
relied more on the power of the very competitive PC market, and
less on its own market power, to prevent (computer makers) from
making modifications that consumers did not want,'' Jackson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said he is concerned that not only has Microsoft
maintained a monopoly position in one market, for operating
systems, it has used predatory tactics to attain monopoly power in
a second market for Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives took sharp exception to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-technology industry that Microsoft has helped create
has unleashed a wave of competition and innovation that has led to
new, more powerful products for consumers, at lower prices than
before,'' said Chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive officer, said the
company's ``intense focus on moving forward has sometimes been seen
as threatening.'' But he added, ``We're supposed to work hard on
new innovations. The industry would not be better if we didn't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Neukom also mentioned an issue that Microsoft has raised before
and on which some in the software industry are equally uneasy about
_ the government dictating what features should be in software.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the appeals court already has ruled, it is a mistake for
government regulators or the courts to try to design
high-technology products,'' he said. ``Government regulation of
software product design would surely slow innovation and harm
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson did note in his ruling that he has been overruled once
before on the issue of combining a browser with an operating
system. But he said Microsoft's bundling of Windows and Internet
Explorer was done not from technical necessity or efficiency but in
an attempt to quash competition, and he believes his ruling is
consistent with Supreme Court opinions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another issue looming over the entire case is whether
changes in technology and the market will render any decision moot
by the time it's final. Microsoft raised that point during the
case, citing the acquisition of Netscape by America Online. Iowa's
Miller, asked if a protracted fight might play to Microsoft's
advantage, said that was one reason for considering a settlement,
but he also said not all of Jackson's proposed remedies might be
stayed while an appeal is heard.
</P>
<P>
   The case has already dragged on for 10 years in judicial and
administrative proceedings that began with a 1990 Federal Trade
Commission probe into whether the company monopolized the operating
systems market.
</P>
<P>
   The initial probe ended three years later with the commission
unable to reach a conclusion, but was re-ignited by the Justice
Department the same year in a separate investigation pushed by many
of Microsoft's competitors including Sun Microsystems and Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, seemed to end in 1994 when Microsoft agreed not to
tie one product to another but kept the right to ``integrate''
products.
</P>
<P>
   It was that integration of the Microsoft browser that led to the
current case.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of those investigations and lawsuits,
Microsoft's value has risen nearly a hundredfold at its peak in
late December. And the impact of this latest ruling for investors
is likely to be only temporary, one analyst said Monday
</P>
<P>
   Scott McAdams, president of Seattle investment firm McAdams
Wright Ragen Inc., said Microsoft stock is likely to remain
``beleaguered'' for a few weeks until investor attention shifts
from the court case to earnings and new product introduction.

SUIT ASKS COURT TO STRIKE DOWN TEXAS' SYSTEM OF ELECTING JUDGES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two public interest groups Monday asked a
federal court to strike down the money-riddled system of electing
state judges, contending that it violates Texans' right to fair and
impartial courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The suit doesn't propose an alternative way to pick judges, but,
if successful, it would force the Legislature to impose a new
system before the 2002 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has become notorious across the country as a state where
`justice is for sale,''' said Tom ``Smitty'' Smith of Public
Citizen Inc., one of the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The millions of dollars given to judges and judicial candidates
by lawyers and other special interests violates due process by
undermining the appearance of neutrality among judges, according to
the petition.
</P>
<P>
   It was filed in U.S. district court by Public Citizen, the Gray
Panthers and five individual Texas lawyers. Public Citizen is a
nonprofit corporation founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. The
Gray Panthers is concerned primarily with issues affecting senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges must not only be impartial, but appear so, in order to
engender respect for and obedience to the law,'' said Fred Lewis,
an attorney for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The suit notes that Texas judges aren't even required to step
down from cases involving political contributors. As a result, it
points out, a survey found that 83 percent of Texans _ including
many judges _ believe that campaign contributions have a
significant effect on judicial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other states have partisan elections for judges, but Texas
is the only state with partisan elections in which a judge is
permitted to solicit donations from lawyers and clients, including
those with cases before the judge, the plaintiffs said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas courts, particularly the Texas Supreme Court, for years
have been at the center of a partisan and philosophical war fueled
by campaign contributions. Consumers and plaintiffs' lawyers, on
one side, have been pitted against doctors, businesses and
insurance companies on the other.
</P>
<P>
   CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes`` has done two shows _ the most recent in
1998 _ questioning whether justice in Texas is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   But several legislative efforts to scrap the current system have
failed amid sharp differences over key issues, including whether
judges should be elected or appointed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush favors electing judges. However, several
members of the Texas Supreme Court have advocated a system under
which judges would be appointed by the governor and subject to
election to keep their seats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Phillips, an early supporter of
efforts to junk the current system, called it a ``bad system that
impairs public confidence in the courts.'' But he said changes
should be made by the Legislature, not by a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Smith of Public Citizen said the Legislature ``has clearly had
the opportunity and failed to remedy this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first lawsuit challenging Texas' judicial selection
system since 1989, when minority plaintiffs, in a voting rights
case, won a federal court ruling that countywide elections for
district judges discriminated against minorities in the state's
largest counties. That decision was overturned, however, by the
U.S. Supreme Court in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Margo Kaufman, a humorist, writer and radio commentator with a
keen instinct for the comedic possibilities in the mundane, died
March 31 at her home in Venice Beach, Calif. She was 46.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was breast cancer, her husband, Eric Mankin, said.
</P>
<P>
   In her writings for such publications as The Los Angeles Times,
The New York Times and Cosmopolitan magazine, Kaufman established
her gift for homing in on the hilarity _ and sometimes pathos _ in
everyday life. She regaled readers with accounts of traveling with
her family, tedious home renovations and her beloved pug dogs or,
after her cancer was diagnosed in 1989, with details of her illness
and its often painful treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Piping and sardonic, her distinctive voice was familiar to radio
listeners in Los Angeles, where she was a regular commentator on
KABC, and nationally, with frequent appearances on National Public
Radio's ``Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me.''
</P>
<P>
   She eventually elaborated upon the essays in three books,
``1-800-Am-I-Nuts?,'' ``This Damn House!: My Subcontract with
America'' and ``Clara, the Early Years: The Story of the Pug Who
Ruled My Life.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Northwestern University, Kaufman began her career
as a columnist for City Paper, an alternative weekly in her native
Baltimore, and continued writing after she moved to Los Angeles,
first at LA Weekly and then for national publications.
</P>
<P>
   An aficionado of pug dogs, which she regarded as ``living proof
that God has a sense of humor,'' Kaufman proudly carried a business
card identifying herself as a Hollywood correspondent for Pug Talk
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son,
Nicholas; her father, Allan Pearlstein of Boca Raton, Fla.; her
mother, Gloria Asnes of New York; a sister, Laurie Goldberg of
Atlanta; a brother, Robert Pearlstein of Baltimore; and a
grandmother, Flora Pearlstein of Baltimore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't get through life without a sense of humor these
days,'' Kaufman told an audience in 1993, a year after learning
that her cancer had spread. ``The most awful things can be really
funny. You have to be able to laugh or it gets too depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Martin, 90, An Actress On Broadway, Film And TV &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helen Martin, a character actress whose career embraced the
Broadway stage as well as films and television, died on March 25 at
her home in Monterey, Calif. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   A founding member of the American Negro Theater in Harlem,
Martin was among the first African-American actresses to take the
Broadway stage, making her debut as the sister of Canada Lee in
Orson Welles' 1941 production of ``Native Son.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to appear in Elia Kazan's staging of ``Deep Are the
Roots''; ``The Long Dream,'' directed by Lloyd Richards; ``The Amen
Corner,'' written by James Baldwin; and alongside her American
Negro Theater colleagues Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis in Davis' play
``Purlie Victorious.''
</P>
<P>
   She also appeared off Broadway as an African queen in ``The
Blacks,'' Jean Genet's historical drama.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager in Nashville, Martin performed with local theater
groups and led a 12-musician band. She attended Fisk University for
two years before moving to Chicago and later New York, where she
apprenticed with the WPA Theater and the Rose McClendon Players.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the early 1970s Martin portrayed a variety of
offbeat characters in television series about black families,
beginning with ``That's My Mama,'' starring Clifton Davis, and
including ``Benson,'' ``Good Times'' and ``Full House.'' She is
perhaps best remembered as Pearl Shay, the loud next-door neighbor
in the show ``227.''
</P>
<P>
   She also appeared in several television specials, including
``Roots,'' in which she portrayed the village elder, a role she
called her favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's film credits include ``Cotton Comes to Harlem,'' ``Repo
Man,'' ``A Rage in Harlem,'' ``Doc Hollywood,'' ``House Party 2,''
``Beverly Hills Cop III,'' ``Kiss the Girls'' and the Warren Beatty
film ``Bulworth,'' in which she played the character known as Momma
Doll.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was nominated for a NAACP Image Award for her role as the
hero's grandmother in the 1987 film ``Hollywood Shuffle'' and in
1992 was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in
Oakland, Calif.

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joe Webb Peoples, a geologist who was key in creating
Dinosaur State Park in Rocky Hill, Conn., died on March 21 at a
hospital in Middletown, Conn. He was 92 and lived in Chester, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples was head of both the geology department of Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the Connecticut State
Geological and Natural History Survey in 1966, when, during
excavation for a state building in Rocky Hill, a slab of rock was
turned over, revealing large three-pronged dinosaur prints on it.
Those prints were the first in what was later discovered to be a
field of more than 2,000, and Peoples was instrumental in
safeguarding the site and the prints, his colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, state officials agreed to preserve the land, and
a state park was created on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right from the beginning, Joe wanted it preserved and saved to
teach schoolchildren,'' said Richard L. Krueger, a geologist who is
director of the park, in an interview with The Hartford Courant.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples was born in Springfield, Tenn., and received bachelor's
and master's degrees from Vanderbilt University and his doctorate
in geology from Princeton in 1932. He joined Wesleyan's faculty in
1935 and retired in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Ruth, died in 1993. He is survived by two sons, David
Webb Peoples of Berkeley, Calif., and Douglass Peoples of East
Hampton, Conn.; a daughter, Penelope Peoples of Cornwall, Vt.; and
four grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.

KARROS: HUNDLEY HOLDS THE KEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL -- Todd Hundley's first throw of the season sent the
ball in to center field. The catcher's first swing sent the ball
into the last row of the right-center field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Be it prophetic or coincidence, it doesn't matter. But a few
hours before the Dodgers opened their season in Montreal, first
baseman Eric Karros said Hundley's season would have the largest
bearing on how the Dodgers fared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest key is Hundley,'' Karros said. ``That's out
biggest key, without question. It's not even close. He has the
biggest impact of anybody on our team, both offensively and
defensively. There is not another players on this team that impacts
the offense and defense as much as he does. Nobody. Not even close.
Who?''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Hundley can give punch and protection to the middle
of the lineup. If he's hitting well, pitchers will hesitate to
pitch around the meat of the lineup to get to him. He was 3 for 5
in the opener, including a hit right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we had it last year, we had a good team,''
Hundley said.``We've just got to be consistent and play good
defense and have strong pitching. Offensively, we can score runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the impact is even greater. The first two times
Jose Vidro reached base, he ran. The first resulted in an errant
throw that allowed Vidro to go to third and eventually score. The
second time it put him in scoring position with less than two outs.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the effect of what a strong defensive showing would
do for the pitchers, who won't have to worry as much about walks or
singles turning into doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year is last year,'' said Hundley, who gunned down only
23 of 129 runners and made a career-high 16 errors last season.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for offense: The major reason the Dodgers went with
Kevin Elster at shortstop is offense. Manager Davey Johnson
believes Elster can provide it, and didn't think Alex Cora was
ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
   However, Elster's found the going rough since winning the job.
He ended spring training with 1 hit in 18 at-bats, and saw his
average drop to .174 in 46 at-bats, and he was 0 for 3 in the
opener. Cora's average was .176 in 34 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But the 35-year-old Elster, who last played a full season in
1996, brings patience to the offense. Despite his dismal spring
average, he had a .321 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Daly dose: In the movie business, Bob Daly would know after the
first night of a release whether his $100 million production was a
hit or a flop.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such time table for a $90 million baseball team.
Daly, admittedly anxious while in the clubhouse before the game,
said the feeling heading into this season was very different from
the last 50-plus seasons he's been a Dodgers fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference going to see a movie that somebody
makes for $80 million than making a movie for $80 million,'' said
Daly, Dodgers managing partner and CEO. ``When you make a movie for
$80 million and you sit for your first screening and the lights
come up the first time out, you pretty much know whether your movie
is going to work or not. ...If I had a failure, there was nothing
you can do. You can't change (the players), or make a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: It's subject to change at any moment, but manager
Davey Johnson tentatively set up how he wants to use the
right-handed set-up contingent in the bullpen. It will be Mike
Fetters, Terry Adams, Alan Mills and Gregg Olson. ...Cindy Lloyd,
the wife of Expos pitcher Graeme Lloyd, on the disabled list with a
shoulder problem, died Monday morning due to complications
resulting from a 14-year battle with Crohn's disease....L.A.'s Gary
Sheffield's fifth inning triple was his first since June 19, 1998,
at Colorado. ...Montreal's Vladimir Guerrero, who had two homers
and four RBI in the game, is 11 for 20 (.550) lifetime against
Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   DODGERS vs. MONTREAL
</P>
<P>
   Time: 4:05 p.m., at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Sports Net 2; 1150-AM, KWKW-AM (1330 Spanish).
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: After a spring of struggling, Dodgers RH Chan Ho Park
(13-11, 5.23 ERA) tries to flip the switch and start pitching well.
And as the No. 2 starter, his success is paramount to the Dodgers'
success. Park had an 8.31 ERA in his last three springs starts and
battled tightness in his arm, but he said he feels fine and relaxed
for his 2000 debut. But the dome hasn't treated Park well. He's 1-2
with a 5.81 ERA in six career games. Montreal RH Hideki Irabu
(11-7, 4.84) makes his Expos debut. He was acquired in an offseason
trade with the Yankees and should bolster a young pitching staff.

U.S. GRANTS VISAS TO ELIAN'S FATHER, OTHER KIN &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department on Monday approved visa
requests for the immediate family of Elian Gonzalez, and the father
of the 6-year-old Cuban boy whose battle over his custody has
created a storm of controversy could arrive in the United States on
Tuesday to claim his son.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of the visas came as immigration officials said
they will transfer the custody of the boy from his great-uncle to
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, upon his arrival from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions will resume Tuesday between the Miami family's
attorneys and INS officials, but those talks will center on the
transfer of the boy to his father. The federal government had set a
deadline for Tuesday morning for Elian's Miami relatives to provide
written assurances that the boy would be surrendered to INS
authorities once all appeals are exhausted. Failure to do so would
have meant revocation of Elian's temporary stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert A. Wallis, INS district director in Miami, said
Monday that ``revocation of Elian's parole has been superseded by
the expected arrival of Juan Miguel Gonzalez in the United States.
The Miami relatives have long said that they wanted the father to
come here. The father has indicated that he wants to be here with
his son. Once Mr. Gonzalez arrives, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service will begin transferring parole care from
(great-uncle) Lazaro Gonzalez to the boy's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials are hoping to reach an agreement that will
allow the transfer to take place without incident by giving the
Miami relatives sufficient time to prepare the boy for his reunion
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transfer of parole care does not mean that the child will
be immediately removed from the home. Instead, it is our hope to
begin a smooth and orderly process that will create as little
disruption as possible for Elian. We wish to add no further trauma
to that which this innocent child has already endured,'' Wallis
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin said the visas for Juan
Miguel Gonzalez and his immediate family ``could be issued as early
as (today).''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement cleared the way for Gonzalez to leave Havana on
Tuesday if he chooses. In addition, Rubin said that visas had also
been granted for Gonzalez's second wife, his infant son, a cousin,
a teacher and a doctor to make the trip as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin said it may take longer to decide whether to allow a
Cuban government official and other nonfamily visa applicants who
have an interest in the case into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presumption is that those visas for immediate family
members is something we will process favorably and quickly,'' Rubin
said. ``Beyond that, we're going to have to review each of the
individual requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez and 27 others submitted visa applications
Monday in Havana. In addition to family members, the applicants
include Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's national assembly,
some of the boy's former schoolmates, a teacher, a doctor and a
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Fidel Castro has requested that nonfamily
members be allowed to accompany Gonzalez in order to smooth the
boy's transition back into Cuban life, should his father be given
custody of his son when he arrives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said a final decision on whether nonfamily members will be
granted visas will be decided by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in consultation with the Justice Department and
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been in the temporary custody of relatives in Miami
since he was rescued at sea four months ago while trying to cross
from Cuba to Florida on a boat with other Cuban refugees, including
his mother. His mother and 10 others apparently drowned when their
boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez will likely travel to the nation's capital, where he
will stay at the home of Fernando Remirez, Cuba's chief U.S.
diplomat here. Gonzalez has requested that he be given immediate
custody of his son, and Justice Department and immigration
officials indicated Monday that Elian would likely be brought to
Washington or some other location as soon as possible to be
reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   An immigration official said the Miami relatives have been told
that if they comply, the boy and his father will remain in the
United States ``until the appeals process has run its course.''
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations resume between attorneys for the Miami family
and immigration officials, concerns were raised that the removal of
the boy from his Little Havana home could spur demonstrations that
may turn violent. In January, anti-Castro groups took to the
streets in Miami's Cuban exile community, clogging streets and
threatening to close Miami International Airport. Group leaders
have pledged to resume demonstrations if the boy is forcibly
removed from his great-uncle's home.
</P>
<P>
   About 5:30 p.m. Monday, Lazaro Gonzalez, his brother, Delfin,
and spokesman Armando Gutierrez returned to the Federal Justice
Building to rejoin talks. About an hour later, after a full day of
talks, the Gonzalez brothers emerged from the federal building with
their attorneys for a brief announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be first and foremost concerned about the
mental, psychological well-being of this young 6-year-old,'' said
Manny Diaz, one of the boy's attorneys. ``To that extent we have
spent a lot of time today talking about numerous issues and will be
back tomorrow to continue our conversations.''

MICHIGAN STATE KEEP ITS PROMISE ON THE WAY TO A NATIONAL TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 BY JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Mateen Cleaves had returned for his senior year
for this national championship stage and those pearl white nets
dangling beneath two baskets. Monday night he grimaced and screamed
his way through a virtuoso performance in the spotlight and then
smiled sweetly and clipped down the nylon as his final bow as a
senior.
</P>
<P>
   He had plenty of help from his Michigan State teammates who had
vowed to be back hours after being defeated by Duke last year in
the national semifinals. His best friend from his hometown of
Flint, Mich., Morris Peterson, rained in 21 points from distances
that were often barely inbounds. Another senior, willowy A.J.
Granger, snaked through the lanes for 19 points worth of tip-ins
and point-blank jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Michigan State's 89-76 victory over young
Florida was Cleaves-willed, Cleaves-orchestrated and as fine a
one-man show a college basketball player could perform. The point
guard who missed the first 13 games of the season with a stress
fracture to his right foot poured all his talent into an 18-point
on 7-of-11 shooting and four-assist outing.
</P>
<P>
   He blunted the Gators runs at every turn so his old team could
beat the precocious one and forced a precocious coach, Florida's
34-year-old Billy Donovan, to wait his turn behind a beloved one,
Michigan State's Tom Izzo. And so finally a wacky, unpredictable
tournament came to a true and just end: the best team in the nation
rightfully crowned.
</P>
<P>
   Only once did it look like it wouldn't _ Florida burst out in
the second half intent on cutting into Michigan State's 11-point
lead. The Gators pounded the ball into Udonis Haslem and Brent
Wright, then Mike Miller drained a 3-pointer to cut the lead to
47-41. But Cleaves refused to let the young Gators to get a grip on
the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   He sliced through the Florida press for a layup; he nailed a
3-pointer - his 18th point - and put the Spartans back up by 50-44.
With 16:18 left, Cleaves was trying to stop Florida's surge again.
He caught a pass on the fly at midcourt and was slapped on the
wrist by Brett Nelson. Cleaves, however, continued to the basket
and tangled with the Gators' Teddy Dupay and was hammered to the
floor. He crawled along the baseline, grabbed his lower leg and
after several minute delay was pulled from the game and taken back
to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates repelled another Florida surge in his absence -
Mike Chappell and Granger banging in clutch 3-pointers. When a big
screen in the RCA dome showed Cleaves making his way back to the
court, the crowd of 43,116 roared. When Cleaves re-entered the game
with 11:51 minutes left and his team up 58-50, even the Gators fans
applauded politely perhaps knowing the end was at hand. The Gators
never got closer.
</P>
<P>
   For Michigan State, the vision of a national title appeared a
year ago at a hotel in Florida. The Spartans had just been beaten
by Duke in the Final Four semifinals, and Izzo gathered his guys in
a crowded room and told them they would be back.
</P>
<P>
   For Florida, the national championship apparition visited just
three weeks ago on a basketball floor in Winston-Salem, N.C. The
Gators were about to be bounced in the first round by Butler in
overtime when Miller hit a runner with three-tenths of a second
left to snatch a 68-67 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Just as this Michigan State team envisioned a championship, the
Spartans had some history on their side _ Magic Johnson led them to
a championship in 1979. Just as Florida was late to embrace its
title possibilities, the Gators' basketball program was a newcomer
to this spring spectacle. In 1994, the Gators made their only prior
Final Four appearance, and this was the school's first ever
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   In taking a 43-32 lead into halftime, Michigan State, the lone
top seed to make the Final Four, showed how age and experience
forged a tough-minded and deliberate team. Three seniors - Cleaves,
Peterson and Granger _ and two juniors, Charlie Bell and Andre
Hutson, looked every bit ready to uphold their refuse-to-lose
motto.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, who had a sole senior and played seven freshmen and
sophomores at least 10 minutes a game, wanted to treat the 94-foot
court like a motor speedway and run over the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan said his Florida team's helter-skelter style was
intended to take the ``fear and anxiety'' out of every possession
so his players would not treat a second of a 40-minute game like
it's ``life or death.'' But the Spartans showed early that they
were prepared for the full-court pressure when Peterson threw the
ball over the hawking defenders to a streaking Cleaves for easy
back-to-back layups and an 11-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Spartans not only did not commit a turnover into 12
minutes into the game, but Cleaves, their floor leader, led them to
53 percent shooting and a team-high 13 points on 5-of-8 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   As they have all season, Florida got a boost from its bench -
especially 3-point bomber, freshman Brett Nelson. The Gators first
five off the bench averaged 31.9 points a game in the regular
season and have upped it to 36.6 in the tournament. When the Gators
second unit entered the game with 13 minutes left, Nelson dropped
two 23-footers from top of the key to cut the Spartans lead to
21-17.
</P>
<P>
   But Izzo, too, dispatched his bench effectively. Freshman Jason
Richardson scored six points off the bench and helped ignite a 14-5
Spartan run that gave Michigan State a 35-22 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By playing stifling man-to-man defense and pounding the boards,
Michigan State also was able to control the tempo of the game. They
allowed their opponents an average of 59 points a game and led the
nation in rebounding margin, 11.7 a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators saw why as the Spartan defense held them to 40
percent shooting as Michigan State staked out the ground under the
basket as their own. Granger and the 6-3 Bell were especially
effective. Granger had four rebounds and scored nine points while
Bell, a tenacious jumper pulled down seven first-half rebounds.

U.S. HAS VISAS FOR CUBAN BOY'S FATHER, 5 OTHERS

<P>
   MIAMI _ State Department officials say they now have visas for
the father of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and five others, and
President Fidel Castro of Cuba said the father could be ready to
travel to the United States as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The six visas could be issued Tuesday morning to the father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and five of the 28 Cubans who had applied for
the trip to the United States, said James Rubin, a State Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But exactly when Gonzalez would arrive, and how he would take
custody of his son if he got here, were still very much in doubt
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government wants to send a large delegation on the
trip to retrieve the boy, a group that includes a psychiatrist,
classmates of Elian, Gonzalez's Cuban family and the president of
the National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, an adviser to Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The six visas that were granted were for Elian's father,
stepmother, an infant half-brother, a cousin, his pediatrician and
his kindergarten teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The other visas are still being considered, American officials
said. The U.S. Interest Section in Havana ``will be submitting a
list of questions to the Cuban government'' as it considers the
other applications to travel to the United States with the boy's
father, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why such a large delegation was necessary, the
father's lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, said he would ``not support
every name on the list,'' but that the pediatrician and family
members made perfect sense if the delegation must wait several
weeks for a decision in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said Gonzalez was ``not willing to come alone and sit for
nine weeks'' without his family.
</P>
<P>
   But as the State Department prepared the legal paperwork to
allow the boy's father into the United States, it was still unclear
exactly how a transfer of the boy, either from Elian's Miami
relatives to federal officials, or from the Miami family to the
father himself, would be accomplished in the volatile atmosphere
surrounding the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Immigration and Naturalization Service said
Monday night that the agency would begin transferring custody of
the boy from his great-uncle in Miami to his father but that that
did not mean that immigration officials had immediate plans to take
Elian from the home where he has lived with relatives since
November.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration official said the agency did not want to add any
trauma to the boy's life in an already tense situation.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials had demanded that Elian's Miami relatives
sign a document by Tuesday morning saying they would hand the boy
over if they lost a court fight in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Atlanta, in May to keep him. If they did not sign it,
immigration officials said, they would revoke the boy's immigration
status and begin the process of ultimately removing the boy from
the home here, which is guarded by Cuban exiles who say they will
not allow the government to take the child.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, immigration officials dropped their demand to
revoke Elian's status. &UR;  &LR;  Maria Cardona, a spokeswoman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, said only that ``our goal
is to reunite Elian and his father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not whether we will transfer Elian to his
father,'' Cardona said, ``but when and how.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that the boy's Miami family was ``making this very,
very difficult for us.'' But he said he expected the relatives here
to agree to some kind of eventual transfer, but with conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana on Monday, Castro and the boy's father were the focus
of a rally of about 3,000 college students from the Caribbean and
Latin America. The students called for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Elian! Down with the lie!'' the students chanted.
Castro has offered two proposals for handing over the child. In
one, the delegation of 28 people would care for Elian in
Washington, as the custody battle is decided in the courts. The
boy's Miami relatives have said they would appeal the case to the
U.S. Supreme Court if they lose in the appeals court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But if American officials are willing to hand the child over to
him immediately, the father said, he would leave for the United
States as early as Tuesday, now that his visa has cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to talk to any kidnapper, nor accept any
condition,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is highly unlikely that any transfer would be quick and
easy, as about 100 demonstrators again gathered outside the boy's
house in Little Havana _ thousands more are on call to join them at
a moment's notice _ all swearing that they will never allow the boy
to be taken from the home.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's Miami relatives have said they do not want the child
to be traumatized in any way, but his great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
said last week that he would not bring the boy out of his home and
that government officials would have to come in and get him.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the boy's Miami relatives said that Elian's
father was verbally abusive to him on the telephone and that he
told the boy that his mother, who drowned in a crossing with him
from Cuba in November, was still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're preposterous,'' Craig said of the accusations. ``They
have a close and loving relationship, father and son.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was a desperate, 11th-hour effort to try and paint
the father as something he is not.

WELLS WASTES NO TIME ON HIS WAY TO MAJORS

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Chicago White Sox planned to put Kip
Wells on the fast track to the majors when they drafted him out of
Baylor with the 16th overall pick in the June 1998 draft, but this
is ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Wells traveled almost as fast as the NASCAR drivers flew around
Texas Motor Speedway last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At this time two seasons ago, Wells was preparing to pitch in a
Big 12 Conference game for the Bears. Tuesday, he starts for the
White Sox against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to be in an organization that needed help quickly,''
Wells said. ``I was in the right place at the right time, and got
drafted by the right team.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he was drafted by an organization that needed pitching
help at the big-league level. But it takes more than opportunity to
make it to the majors. It also takes talent, and the 22-year-old
right-hander with the low-90 mph fastball, outstanding curveball
and good changeup is in the majors because he has plenty of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to be one of the good young pitchers in the
American League,'' White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' professional career actually got off to a slow start.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox drafted him after he went 13-4 with a 3.71
earned-run average his junior year at Baylor, but he didn't sign
until December.
</P>
<P>
   Once he made his professional debut last spring, he moved up
quickly. He was 13-8 with a 3.29 ERA in 25 starts for Class-A
Winston-Salem and Double-A Birmingham, then was promoted to the big
leagues to make a start for the injured Jim Parque on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a spot start,'' Wells said. ``I didn't know if I would
be there for the rest of the season or just one day.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be for the rest of the season. He beat the
Detroit Tigers by allowing one run on six hits in 51/3 innings to
earn a spot in the rotation, and went 4-1 with a 4.04 ERA in seven
starts. He had one bad outing, when he allowed eight runs in 32/3
innings against the Indians. Throw out that start, and his ERA was
2.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuff and the velocity of your pitches gets you drafted,''
he said. ``Then it's a matter of getting guys out on a regular
basis and making adjustments from pitch to pitch. Luckily, I was
able to do that early in my career as opposed to taking three or
four years to find that.'' nn

NEW GUYS, OLD PUDGE LIFT RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Kenny Rogers was masterful. The defense
turned four double plays. The American League's Most Valuable
Player was just that. The right fielder was every bit as good as
his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Even former President George Bush was on his game, throwing out
the ceremonial first pitch without bouncing it up to home plate or
injuring catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers couldn't ask for anything more for an
announced crowd of 49,332 fans at The Ballpark in Arlington, the
largest regular-season crowd in club history. Everything seemed to
fall into place for the Rangers as they trounced the Chicago White
Sox, 10-4, on Monday in the season-opener for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special day,'' first baseman David Segui said.
</P>
<P>
   That it was, especially for right fielder Gabe Kapler.
Redefining the meaning of sudden impact, Kapler smashed two home
runs in his first two at-bats with the Rangers and added a
run-scoring single in the fifth. By that time he was getting
standing ovations just for adjusting his socks properly and putting
his glove on the correct hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy for Gabe,'' Rogers said. ``That's a great day
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler had help. Rodriguez also smacked two home runs as the
Rangers showed they may still score a few runs even though Juan
Gonzalez and Todd Zeile are no longer in their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything seemed to just click with just about everybody,''
Kapler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some question marks about our offense, but we proved
we certainly score some runs,'' left fielder Rusty Greer said.
``Being consistent at that will be important; you can't score 10
runs one night and one run the next. But I think you're going to
see us put some runs on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, taking advantage of the offense and four double plays,
kept the White Sox under control for eight innings, allowing just
one run on six hits. He walked two and didn't strike out a batter,
but the defense behind him made every play.
</P>
<P>
   The victory allowed him to extend his home winning streak to 19
consecutive games, tying him for the third-longest streak in
major-league history. Rogers hasn't lost a game in his home park
since June 28, 1997, while pitching with the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have drawn up a better scenario,'' Rogers said.
``Everything went well. Good pitching, great offense, great
defense. That can win you a lot of ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler got the Rangers going with a second-pitch home run off
White Sox starter and loser Mike Sirotka in the second inning. The
White Sox picked up a run in the third with a couple of hits and
Mark Johnson's double-play grounder. But Rodriguez smashed a
three-run homer in the bottom of the inning to give the Rangers a
4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the fifth, Kapler and Rodriguez had gone deep
again, the Rangers were in complete command with a 9-1 lead, and
White Sox manager Jerry Manuel was probably wondering if President
Bush still had something left on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those days when everything went right for us,''
Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``It was fun to watch the way we
got after it today.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``it's-only-one-game'' theory was evident throughout the
clubhouse, but shortstop Royce Clayton said, ``It's very important
to see what we're capable of. Not only offensive, but Kenny pitched
a great game and we did what we're supposed to do on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that we did a lot of little things was positive,
like hitting the cutoff man and keeping runners from advancing. We
didn't always do those things last year, but you have to if you're
going to be a good ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling tickled inside today to see what this ballclub
is capable of doing.'' nn

DR. RUTH E. BENESCH, 75, EXPERT IN HOW RED BLOOD CELLS WORK
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Iowa, Md., Mass.)  (nk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Ruth Erica Benesch, a biochemist and educator who
teamed with her husband at Columbia University to advance the
knowledge of how the body's red blood cells function, died on March
25 at her home in the Bronx. She was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was vascular disease, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Dr. Reinhold Benesch, shared a laboratory
at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and studied the
mechanisms by which hemoglobin transports oxygen to living tissues.
In 1966, they discovered that one particular phosphorous compound,
called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, had an important role in loosening
the bonds between hemoglobin and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Max F. Perutz, the British biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in
chemistry in 1962, wrote that the discovery by the Benesches in
1966 ``opened a new era'' of knowledge about the respiratory
system. Their work, he said, generated a ``flood of papers'' from
scientists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The couple were professors of biochemistry at Columbia. He died
in 1987; she became an emeritus professor of biochemistry in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Born Ruth Erica Baade in Paris, she was raised in Berlin. In
1939, she escaped a few months before the war in Europe, taken out
by the Kindertransport program, which rescued Jewish children from
Germany. She graduated from the University of London, came to the
United States in 1947 and received a Ph.D. at Northwestern
University in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   She was affiliated with Johns Hopkins University, the State
University of Iowa and the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods
Hole, Mass., before she joined the staff at Columbia as a research
associate in 1960. She was named a full professor in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Benesch is survived by a son, Andrew, of Highland Park, N.J.; a
daughter, Susan, of Milford, Conn.; a sister, Madeleine, of London;
and two granddaughters.

KAPLER AN INSTANT SMASH WITH RANGERS, FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CARLOS MENDEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ ``Juan Who?'' they asked. ``Juan Who?''
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler answered with two home runs and one wink.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers' new right fielder needed only one pitch to
make an already good impression even better to the fans at The
Ballpark in Arlington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love him,'' Vernon Gray, 26, of Cleburne said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler _ the other right fielder involved in the Juan Gonzalez
trade to Detroit in the off-season _ hit two bases-empty homers,
added a run-scoring single and showed off his arm with an
on-the-money throw to third base during the Rangers' 10-4 victory
against the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to love from his first impression before the home
fans?
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to be a real nice young man,'' Chuck McCoy of
Arlington said.
</P>
<P>
   And a real nice ballplayer to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real game-day player,'' George Atkins, 53, of Bedford
said.
</P>
<P>
   And a real nice-looking ballplayer to still others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' said Lindsey Hall, 18, of Fort Worth. ``I'll be
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ballpark employees couldn't escape Kapler's charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely adds to the view from right field,'' usher
Joanie Vasko said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler returned to his position in the field amid cheers after
every inning _ the ovations only grew louder after the two home
runs _ and when he finally couldn't ignore the ``Juan Who? Juan
Who?'' chants anymore, he gave a half-turn of the head, smiled and
sent a wink to the fans in the lower Home Run Porch.
</P>
<P>
   They went wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not three home runs?'' yelled Atkins, who said Kapler
signed a ball for his 10-year-old son, Harrison, before the game.
``I think he's already been accepted. Look around. If you're out in
right field today, you're having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   The glowing spring-training reports about Kapler's attitude and
hustle did wonders for his popularity even before he played a home
game. Debbie Winter of Roanoke, a season-ticket holder for the past
five seasons, said she witnessed Kapler's enthusiasm first-hand
during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real accessible, and when he told you he was excited to
be here, you could tell he was thrilled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To some fans, that marks a change from Gonzalez, who gave the
impression of aloofness, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciated his ability,'' said Alan Gonzales, 28, who made
the drive from Austin for Monday's game. ``I don't think we'll
forget him, but I think it will be a lot easier to forget him if
they beat the Yankees (in the playoffs) this year with Kapler.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Kapler's lone mistake was met with forgiveness. He ran
through a stop sign from third-base coach Jerry Narron and should
have been thrown out, but scored when the ball popped loose from
the catcher's glove. The fans credited him for hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's aggressive,'' fans said to each other as they reviewed
the play. ``As long as he stays consistent, we don't need two home
runs a game from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler said he'll keep trying to impress his right-field support
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get those guys on your side,'' he said. ``A
lot of them sit out there every day, and you don't want them to
think you're not out there to win it all. I want them to know we
are there to win it all so they'll keep coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Who?'' nn
